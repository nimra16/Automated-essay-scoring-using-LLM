17860,7,Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have savere anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family!!! They had grandkids that really annoyed me!!! My foster family had a different religion than me I am atheist. They are @CAPS1 and they would constantly tell me I am wrong!!! It made me very upset but I didn’t say nothing because I was being patient. And I hate it. With my anger problems im very surprised I didn’t go off on them? But yes patience does take practice lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient!!! Tolerance twords children… I don’t like kids to much but where I wed to live there were tons of little kids that were the grand kids of my foster family and I sued those kids are annoying but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate and so are “guardian parents” they are the worst they tell you what to do and they aint even youre parents but I tolerated it.,8.0,8.0,16.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2,2,,":**

17899,7,"“@CAPS1! Look out!” @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here’s a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. It’s unbearable to watch. Ambulences’ sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that’s @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, I’d lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5’d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn’t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I’d still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe it’s just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldn’t know because in no way we we typical. When we aren’t fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. “@CAPS4”, @CAPS5 starts, “I know I haven’t been patient with you lately, and for that I’m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing.” I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, “I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?” @CAPS5 didn’t have to explain any farther. “@CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around,” my voice caught in my throat, “just to get my stupid notebook.” A single tear weaved its way down my face. “@CAPS7, hunny!” my mother teared up as @CAPS6. “That doesn’t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!” I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. “@CAPS8,” I said, regaining composure, “that’s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8.” @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother’s lips. “I will wait then.” And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect.",12.0,12.0,24.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,12,2,,":**

I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one.I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree.I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didn’t blend in, I would get shot.

17909,7,"I was patient a few years ago with my brother @PERSON1. It was almost his birthday, and he was very excited. He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television, the helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birth day or not .He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it so he kept bugging me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying .I did not, because I knew if I did I would get in trouble. So I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didn’t work, because he kept on asking me any way.

First of all the drive- it was horrible and long. We were in the car for what seemed like forever before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient and I wa s. I didnt complain at all. When we got to disneyland the firs day the lines were terrible! Some of the waits were up t @NUM1 hours long! Well i didnt complain,but it was hard not to!My little brother wanted to go on all these kid rides that the lines were huge for , but i held my patients not wanting to get anyone upset. Since I like everything to get done fast and not waste my time waiting i felt like i was going to explode at dinner. Dinner was a this seafood resteraunt wich was bad anyway because i hate seafood!while all this waiting was happening I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the disney busses to get back to your hotel. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patients through all of the waiting. I learned all lot of things there. One disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient. Second patients is one of the hardest things in life, but some of the best things in life require you to have patience.

With all this patients it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctors office for @NUM3 hours and I had to wait in his waiting room. And also I went to my living room with my mom and she just started talking on the phone and she told me to hold on but my sister kept on interrupting her and I told her you need to hold on and let mom finish talking on the phone so she ran up the stair and she said your stupid punk so I said I don’t care.,6.0,6.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,,,,"The `response.text` quick accessor only works when the response contains a valid `Part`, but none was returned.

I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didn’t keep my mouth shut so my mom didn’t want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. That’s exactly what I did and I got my game.

17938,7,"Patience is important in life. Something when you don’t have patience things tend to go wrong and that’s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn’t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didn’t you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn’t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn’t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn’t have patience. But if they did that wouldn’t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed.

I tried my best to clear my head and be paitient. But when I opened them, I was sitting on some bars in line for celar paint’s @ORGANIZATION1. The voices of many people ran through my ears as laughter, happiness, and danger. The line was estimates at a two hour wait, but my friend @PERSON1 and I wanted to ride the ride. We started up at the roller coaster while the sun beat down taunting us. “@CAPS1 is this taking so long?!” I said impatiently. “@CAPS2 next time we should go during the week. Do you want to leave?” “@CAPS3.”  I fought with myself to be patient for the ride. The line slowly scooted forth. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead. I wanted to remain patient, so I pulled out my music player and thought of my music. I became more willing to wait. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to move forward. Embarrassed, I jammed my music player in my pocket. But the line moved a tremendous amount. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were in the place to get on.

Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people that aren’t patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience.

17998,7,"There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person.",9.0,8.0,17.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,,"Timeout of 600.0s exceeded, last exception: 503 failed to connect to all addresses; last error: UNKNOWN: ipv4:142.250.185.42:443: tcp handshaker shutdown"
18000,7,"The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved foward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally the piolt got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane and go back to the @LOCATION2. At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3 and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane. As we started moving forward the plane’s wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendents helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I a reed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3.",10.0,12.0,22.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,"Timeout of 600.0s exceeded, last exception: 503 failed to connect to all addresses; last error: UNKNOWN: ipv4:142.250.185.42:443: tcp handshaker shutdown"
