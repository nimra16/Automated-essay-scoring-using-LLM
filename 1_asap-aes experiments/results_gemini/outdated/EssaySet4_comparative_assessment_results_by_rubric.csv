**Comments:**

The student's response partially addresses the demands of the question. The student correctly identifies that the author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng will take the test again when everything starts coming back. However, the student does not provide any details or examples from the story to support this idea.

The student's response uses some expressed and implied information from the text. The student correctly identifies that Saeng will take the test again when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. However, the student does not explain how these events are connected to Saeng's decision to take the test again.

The student's response does not clarify or extend understanding beyond the literal. The student simply restates the information from the story without providing any new insights or interpretations.

8876,4,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show a sense of determination that Saeng posesses. When Saeng comes back and shows her mother the hibiscus plant, she is very upset, with tears in her eyes.Her mother at first is disappointed in her for buying the plant, but is then understanding when she realizes that Saeng was distraught. The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which comforts Saeng a little bit, helping her gain the determination she needs to recover. The story says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote states that Saeng realizes that things at home can be the same as things in her new country. The author uses the term “familiar” to express that Saeng is starting to accept the fact that some things @MONTH1 be different, but she will eventually get used to it, making her view on life more positive.

That’s what matters.” Saeng is the winter hibiscus that’s strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test won’t matter until spring when she will take it and pass.

8981,4,"The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die.

As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is crucially upset about it. nobody wants to fail at something and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test. knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to “start over” again or to “try again”. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to “start life” again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed.

For example, the response correctly states that ""Saeng misses her home so much and she can't grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home."" However, the response does not provide specific examples from the text to support this claim.

The response does not fully connect the support to a conclusion or assertion made about the text. For example, the response states that ""Saeng didn't want to expect the move but noticeing that she won't forget any memories she starts to take on new memories."" However, the response does not explain how this supports the author's conclusion that Saeng will take the test again when she is ready.

They correctly identify that Saeng failed the test at the beginning of the story and that she learns new things about herself and her surroundings through her experiences in the greenhouse. However, the student's analysis of the last paragraph is somewhat superficial and does not fully explore the complexities of the text.

**Specific feedback:**

* The student correctly states that Saeng learns that she has to get used to living in the United States. However, they do not provide any specific examples from the text to support this claim.
* The student's interpretation of the geese flying in a ""V"" formation as a reminder of Vietnam is somewhat forced and not fully supported by the text.
* The student's conclusion that the author ends the story with Saeng taking the driver's test again in the spring because it is a new beginning for her is too simplistic and does not take into account the other themes and symbols in the story.

**Highlighted mistakes:**

* ""hung in @LOCATION1"" should be ""living in the United States""
* ""remainded her that she has to when she saw the geese fly in the ""V""formation,it was the same as back at home in Vietnam"" should be ""reminded her that she had to when she saw the geese fly in the ""V"" formation, which was the same as back at home in Vietnam""
* ""This is the beginning for them as well as Saeng"" should be ""This is a new beginning for them as well as Saeng"""

9135,4,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  For example the fact that they moved to a different country. Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng & her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2,,":**

However, the response does not provide any analysis or interpretation of the text beyond the literal meaning.

But as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. As Saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating Big @CAPS1 and new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either.

This is shown when Saeng says ""I-I failed the test"" (page 193). This makes her even more sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when the flowers are budding, she will try again. She does this when she says to herself ""...in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" (page 193). This shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward to taking the test again."
9220,4,"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again”. The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By @CAPS1 that she’ll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels abut @LOCATION1 and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with @LOCATION1 and adjust to the change in her life.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2,,,,,"**Rubric 1: Score 2**

9292,4,"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States.

9301,4,"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saeng’s life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driver’s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, “[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, “She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had become…almost familiar to her now.” Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.  ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2,2,,":**

In the story Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than making new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts remembering old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled “jasmine”, she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is “not a real one” and she also says it’s “not like the kind we had before.” @CAPS1, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and she does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. @CAPS1 when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again.",2.0,2.0,2.0,2,,,,":**

9319,4,"Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show hope and renewal for the character Saeng. Spring represents birth and renewal, a second chance for Saeng. She had previously failed what seems to be an important test (perhaps her citizenship test), and motivated her to try and remember her past, which she sorely misses. The winter hibiscus seems to represent herself, and this illustrates it: “it’s-it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. ‘Not like the kind we had before’ I know her mother said quietly' 'its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters. This describes Saeng’s position perfectly – she is not the same, as happy as she once was, but she can make it through the hard times, and can bloom in the spring to take the test again.

**Comments:**

The student's response partially addresses the demands of the question by explaining that the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to try again. However, the response does not provide specific details or examples from the text to support this idea.

The response also uses some expressed information from the text to demonstrate understanding, such as the fact that Saeng failed her driving test and decided to take it over after planting with her mother. However, the response does not provide any implied information from the text to support the idea that Saeng's experience of planting has given her confidence in striving to succeed once again.

Finally, the response does not clarify or extend understanding beyond the literal. The response simply restates the information from the text without providing any new insights or interpretations.

**Highlighted mistakes:**

- ""It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again."" (This sentence is not supported by any evidence from the text.)
- ""In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting."" (This sentence is not relevant to the question.)
- ""For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that."" (This sentence is unclear and does not provide any evidence to support the idea that Saeng's experience of planting has given her confidence in taking the test again.)"

In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land.

9442,4,"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2,,,":**

The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the text. They correctly identify the main character's vow to take the test again in the spring and provide some examples from the story to support their interpretation. However, their analysis is somewhat superficial and does not fully explore the complexities of the text.

**Specific feedback:**

* The student correctly identifies the hibiscus as a symbol of Saeng's resilience and determination. However, they do not fully explain how the author's use of the hibiscus in the concluding paragraph reinforces this theme.
* The student's analysis of Saeng's emotional journey is somewhat simplistic. They correctly identify that Saeng experiences a range of emotions throughout the story, but they do not fully explore the significance of these emotions or how they contribute to her character development.
* The student's writing is clear and concise, but it lacks some of the sophistication and depth of analysis that would be expected in a higher-scoring response.

**Highlighted",":**

* ""I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower."" - The student's use of the word ""relevant"" is unclear. They should have used a more specific term, such as ""symbolic.""

* ""It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory."" - The student's use of the word ""blossoming"" is somewhat ambiguous. They should have used a more specific term, such as ""rejuvenation.""

This is a huge jump and for her to be confident with herself is very persistant. The way the author concludes the story, with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” definitely portrays Saeng, the main character as a persistant person, and that is the purpose of the quote.",2.0,2.0,2.0,2,,,":**

9482,4,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with  the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng’s resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads “And besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” This excerpt demonstrates Saeng’s love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news “I-I failed the test” @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good.

9515,4,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are “familiar to Saeng now “ despite her thinking of them as “strange before.” The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saeng’s vow that she will “take that test again” in the spring, “When the snows melt…”etc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saeng’s past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future.
