20716,8, A long time ago when I was in third grade I had a friend @PERSON2 who's mom was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class.   The next day @PERSON2 and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me &lt;hey your pretty good at making people laugh&gt;. I said &lt;no I am not my jokesare horrible&gt;. He said &lt;@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school&gt;. I said @CAPS1 so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON2 and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS3 him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said hi I'm @CAPS4 do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION1 said yeah sure. I started &lt;@CAPS5 knockshe said &lt;who's thereI said &lt;booshe said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said &lt;ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON2 turned to me and said &lt;I told you so&gt;.   @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said &lt;@CAPS1 sounds like a plan&gt;. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @PERSON2 house she said &lt;yeah just make sure its @CAPS1 with his mom&gt;. @PERSON2 asked his mom she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2 house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON2 and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS1. So I said to them &lt;@CAPS5 @CAPS5&gt;they replied &lt;who's thereI said &lt;boothey said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1 but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.

20717,8," Softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. I love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering @CAPS2. Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball many laughs, tears, and frustrations so when I had the opportunity to play on a top notch team I looked forward to all the many more memories I would have.  Hood @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was my team name, I had played almost four years with this local team. Many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them. I felt like I had my set team, I was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer. As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no; I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. At that point softball was just around the corner and I began to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. I then decided I would take a chance and try for this team.  As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. I wanted this team to like me, I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. The time moved quickly and I wished it would slow; my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. I was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ""ready or not here we come"". Nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was second guessing every move I made, I even had troubles removing my seat belt.  As I approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by I saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run; that was it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with the @CAPS2, I just couldn't take it. Then as I walked onto the field they all grew a smile. Each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back, I now had made new friends, friends I knew I would grow close with. My year with this team was amazing I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. Those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @CAPS2. I have had great memories with the @CAPS2, but also softball is all about going out discovering new friendships; therefore, enjoying the sport as well as the people.",21.0,26.0,46.0,46.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,,,":**

20718,8," Some people like making people laugh, I love it. I will do most anything to get a good laugh. I will make fun of my self, do insanely stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was little I didn't really understand laughter. For some odd reason I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. I was kind of ""special"" in some areas as a kid (I still am today). Still at the tender age of five I loved making people laugh, and being special I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Mind you I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. I was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet. For example one time I hit myself in the head with a hammer, another time I was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it, and needed stitches. One of the craziest times though was a couple days before I had to take pictures and I wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how ""special"" I was (I got it from her) wouldn't allow me to. The expert persuasive kid I was back then convinced her to let me go outside. Before I could even reach the street I fell head first on to the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures. Although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter not me being a spaz.  Now that you know that I love making people laugh, I'm ""special"", and that I'm a complete spaz I can get on with the story. Well I was in kindergarten and I loved school because I got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks, that might sound stupid but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was bully's. Surprisingly I have never had a bully except kindergarten, but this was a bad bully. He would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal (which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see). I still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore, he's a goody two shoes now which I think is odd. Anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day I got a wedgies). That day is what this whole story is about, it's why I told you I love making people laugh, why I told you I'm ""special"", and a spaz, everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. It started out like any other day in kindergarten. I woke up, did my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed to school. When I got to school I grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. I did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). It came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack. When we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time. We were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story, right when I would get into the story and lose my guard I would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five year old) wedgie. The story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited. The story finally finished and we were standing up, and this is where my memory starts to fade. I cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter, me being a ""special"" spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears. I remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. It took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing at me.  To this day I still get reminded by classmates about that day, of course I can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten, I'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. It was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person, I can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). So remember, being ""special"" could sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, what makes people laugh.",15.0,20.0,40.0,40.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20719,8," ""LAUGHTER""  @CAPS1 I hang out with my friends, the one thing we do best is laugh sometimes for no reason. The thing we tend to laugh about is running into trash cans, laundry or maybe even about what we ate for dinner the @TIME1 before. @CAPS1 I am usual stressed out the one thing I love is to hangout with my friends. they usual are good listeners. overall. Though they take your mind off things. So with my friends you can count on having a great time no matter what the occasion is.    @CAPS1 I say trash can I really mean trash cans I remember this one time in the hall way at school my friend was hanging on to my back pack because she tends to loose me in the hall way a lot because I walk a lot faster then her, anyways the class bell had just rouge an all the student were heading to lunch we were. I was just getting ready to cross the hall way an she said don't do it, so I did an nobody stopped! so she kinda slide into a trash can that was hanging on the wall in the hall way, she @MONTH1 have knocked it off but I can't really say? I was still walking an the sound effects were so funny I laugh at it still.       My friend an I have a inside joke? we went out to lunch together. @CAPS1 we saw a laundry mate an I minds went crazy, we made up a funny joke an said that we should make our self's aprons with lots color and rhinestones, so that way if we wanted to get all of our laundry done at the same time. We would take off our clothes there an put on our so called aprons. An do our laundry like it was nothing. @CAPS1 our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean. yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one.  Now about the food its sort of like the laundry but I guess better? I remember @CAPS1 i came to school the next day i just started talking about what i had for dinner @TIME1 i think at that time my mom had asked us if we wanted chicken @PERSON1 an my sister as i screamed an said hell yeah? so dinner was ready an @CAPS1 we went to go site at the table we looked at it an it was not what we expected it to be? it was frozen out of a box an it looked like somebody had eaten the food than puked it back up? it was that great looking.    All of these thing that have named or talked about is how my life is almost everyday @CAPS1 there not drama i love my friend I don't think I could have asked for a better one because all we do is laugh an have fun an fun in to trash can locker an whatever else there is but the one thing that matter the most with my one friend is that @CAPS1 we get in to a fight we can not stay mad at each other well I now that I can't. So at the end of the day I ask her are we done being made at each other? an than we just look at each other an laugh because that about all we can do because the reason was so stupid there was really no need for it.that is what a friend is to me having fun not worrying about what is around us. but just to have fun an be silly. not anybody else but are self's an sometime @CAPS1 we have are really goofy days? we make up the story about our laundry. talking about my life with my friends is nothing better than to laugh because deep down inside you an your friend will look back an say wow those where the best day was @CAPS1-would would get in trouble in class for talking way to much.

""@CAPS5's not cold @CAPS20."" ""@CAPS6,"" replies @PERSON1. ""@CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18.""   We start our snowman by building the base (The biggest piece for the bottom). @CAPS3 after about @NUM1 minutes the base is almost done, but we notice that we're getting cold. ""@CAPS7 we should go inside?"" @PERSON1 says. ""@CAPS8, I @CAPS7 mom will even make us some hot chocolate."" @CAPS9 off we go back inside hoping for some delectably warm hot chocolate. I see @CAPS11 mom @CAPS3 ask, ""@CAPS10 we have some hot chocolate please?""

As @CAPS34 did that I fell @CAPS20 of @CAPS11 chair in a fit of hysterical laughter.    @CAPS11 mom hears the thump of me hitting the floor @CAPS3 runs upstairs to find me laughing. ""@CAPS1's @CAPS9 funny?"" she asks.

""@CAPS6, @CAPS28 I'm gonna keep at @CAPS5 until I get @CAPS5 right."" @CAPS9 I @CAPS35 to mimic everything I saw him do, but to no avail.

20723,8," My best friend, @PERSON1 and I have been close ever since we were @NUM1. We met through @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lessons at our local dance studio. We've stayed close throughout the years because we've always done similar activities. We're very different from each other though. I'm more out going, I like to speak my mind and I'm more carefree. @CAPS4's the opposite. @CAPS4's very conservative and @CAPS4 can take things too seriously. But either way, we manage to even each other out. Finals week had just gotten over, and @LOCATION1 and I had been planning a sleepover all week. We just needed time to relax and have some time to ourselves. When I had gotten home from school, I gave her a quick call. ""@CAPS3?"" @CAPS4 answered. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS12 time did @CAPS16 wanna hang out?"" I asked. ""I was thinking @NUM2?"" ""@CAPS6 good!"" I quickly hung up the phone and gathered up my gear. I grabbed my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas, and my blanket. I put my shoes on and headed back out the door. My dad dropped me off with all of me gear. I had brought my pajamas, my pillow, and an extra blanket. I walked up her sidewalk to her door, knocked, and waited. Only seconds later did @CAPS4 answer it with a big smile across her face. @CAPS4 lead me down to her basement where @CAPS4 had all the junk food set out ready for us to attack. @CAPS4 had gone to the store earlier that day and had bought everything. @CAPS4 had set it all up on her old pool table that nobody used. There were chips, cookies, sodas, candy, chocolate, and pizza. I set my stuff down on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted. Of course, we could eat all the food. We simply weren't big enough. After eating for almost an hour straight, we laid on her basement floor trying to gain composure. We started laughing at silly little things that came up on commercials on her big screen @CAPS7. Eventually, we got to talking about how each of our finals went. ""I did soo good on all of mine! I'm gonna get ALL A's"" @PERSON1 bragged. @CAPS4 has gotten straight A's every year since middle school. ""I think I did pretty @CAPS8 too, not so sure about a @NUM3 though."" I said as I was laying upside down on the floor. ""@CAPS8, we'll just see tomorrow!""  We finally decided to move ourselves over to the couch on the opposite side of the pool table, so we could face the @CAPS7. It was already @NUM4 in the @TIME1 and we were still on a sugar high. We switched back and forth from watching some old scary movie, and the top @NUM5 music videos of the week. That had passed some time and before we knew it, it was @NUM2 in the @TIME1. @PERSON1 and I were laying on opposite ends of each other. Occasionally, one of us would get some chips or candy from the table. We grew tired to the point where we couldn't keep our eyes open. No one even had enough energy to turn off the overhead light. We fell asleep fast. When I woke-up the next @TIME1, @PERSON1 wasn't laying across from me anymore. @CAPS4 was sitting in the corner chair where I had set my stuff. I looked at the clock, and it was already @NUM4:30 in the afternoon. I looked back and @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 seemed somewhat upset. I shifted around under my blanket so I could face her. ""@CAPS5..."" I grunted, while I was stretching. ""@TIME1."" @CAPS4 said abruptly. @CAPS4 was holding a folded piece of paper in her hand. ""@CAPS12's up?"" I asked, sitting up on the couch. @CAPS4 crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me. I picked it up from my lap and unfolded it. It was her report card. I scanned down the paper looking at all of her grades. @CAPS4 had received all A's... and one @CAPS13. @CAPS4 had gotten a @CAPS13 in her @CAPS15 class. I looked up from the paper to see her hands covering her face. I walked over to her kinda amused by how upset @CAPS4 was.  ""@CAPS16 got a @CAPS13... and @CAPS16're crying?"" I asked. @CAPS4 looked up at me quickly. I looked at her with a stupid face, and @CAPS4 busted out laughing. @CAPS4 felt so stupid for crying over @NUM8 @CAPS13. I stared laughing too. I knew my grades we be far worse. Heck, I'd be glad to get @CAPS13's. @PERSON1 and I are the perfect best friends. We even each other out. I tell her to lighten up, and @CAPS4 tells me to focus more. @CAPS16 can't take little things like that too seriously, it's just not worth the stress. Sometimes @CAPS16 just gotta relax, and maintain your focus. @CAPS16 have to find your perfect balance of work, and play.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20725,8," I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness.",21.0,20.0,,41.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

I am the type of person that can @CAPS6 at something so stupid that when I get done laughing, I don't even know why I started laughing in the first place. I can @CAPS6 so hard that nothing comes out at all! @CAPS1's amazing what laughter can do to a persons heart. The way @CAPS1 makes you feel, the way @CAPS1 makes you act. @CAPS1's so contagious, and @CAPS1 happens all around us everyday. You are never too old for laughter, @CAPS1 happens to the best of us. young or old, @CAPS1 doesn't matter. Laughter has no age limit. One time @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I stayed up until three in the @TIME1. We were so delirious, and kooky, we acted like crazy people. Now we have the type of relationship where we can @CAPS6 at almost anything. Literally almost anything... As we were staying up, we drank lots of soda and had sugary foods to fuel us for the night. We made up songs, we danced around @CAPS2 house, and @CAPS1 felt like we laughed for hours! I laughed until tears were flowing out of @CAPS2 eyes, and i couldn't get a breath out of @CAPS2 heaving lungs. When @CAPS1 gets to the silent laughing, @CAPS1's even more funny because that person can't control @CAPS1, and they look so hilarious because there rocking back and forth, with this silly expression upon their face, not making any noise at all. Have you ever just laughed for what feels like a lifetime? How did you feel after that ""lifetime"" of laughter? @CAPS1 almost feels as something as powerful as the sun just warms over your heart and soul. When I @CAPS6 I feel all the happiness and emotion just flow all throughout @CAPS2 entire body. @CAPS1's one of the greatest feelings in the world, I really can't think of a greater feeling than the warmth that laughter brings. @CAPS1's so great when you and a @CAPS3, or group of friends can sit back and enjoy the laughter you share. Even when your feeling down, maybe need some cheering up. You can always depend on a @CAPS6 to pull you through. No matter what mood I'm in, @CAPS5 I hear someone laughing, @CAPS1 is so hard to not join in. Laughing is so contagious! @CAPS1 effects us in our everyday life's. I bet you that, you cannot go one day without hearing someone @CAPS6, or you not laughing yourself. I probably @CAPS6 about five hundred times a day, @CAPS5 not more. I love hearing people @CAPS6, @CAPS1 brightens @CAPS2 mood and also @CAPS2 day. I would most definitely say laughter is very important and beneficial for a relationship. I mean imagine the world without laughter. Boring, right? @CAPS2 advice, @CAPS6 like you heard the funniest thing in the world. @CAPS6 like there is no tomorrow.

20727,8," Laugher Laughter is to express delight, fun, or a object of a joke. Laughter is something we all do, its a large benefit in our life and it happend on a everyday scedual. Without laughter we couldn't express our happy, out going side, we would have no particullar feeling in life except for frowning, which is a proven fact to cose more wrinkles beacuse of how many more muscles it uses.  For me laughter is a all day thing, @CAPS1 show, my friends, family and, horses are my number one reason for my frown to be tured up side down. You @MONTH1 think horses cant smile, or talk but @CAPS2 do have their own ways of showing a personality that will make you laugh. Shere @CAPS2 are all smart, but @CAPS2 can be clutsy or goofy at times. Mostly @CAPS2 all just make you laugh and giggle like your own little brothers or sisters.  There is this one time that I will always have locked away in the back of my mind. It took place on a @DATE1 mid-day at the beach on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was with my friend and we both had our two horses saddled, ready to go. Both us and our horses felt the energy rush when we saw the waves pouning at the shore with the salty smell in our noses.  Once we hit the sand we were running side by side with the wind wistling past our ears like a moving train. The horses heads were equaly pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water, the horses pranced and danced arounds like yearlings again, @CAPS2 would walk tell into the water tell it was drenching us both then soon as the next wave would come rushing up, we'ed swerve around and try to beat the wave to the shore.   After about five hours of adventuring caves, sand dunes and starfish we were all worn out, then decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we eat dinner while watching the sun go down to finsih the perfuct day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on his neck, as I was about to walk out my horse tured his head, then gave my a nudge like he was saying ""thanks for the good time"". Driving home I knew this was a perfuct day because of the laughter, and of all the times I just laughed for the injoyment, also my face did hurt a little from smiling so much.",16.0,15.0,,31.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

20728,8," Starting a story out with two @NUM1 @DATE1 old boys named @ORGANIZATION1 can already be considered a comedy. Those are the names of my identical twin cousins @ORGANIZATION1 I can honestly admit that they are @NUM2 of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't exactly the most intelligent human on earth, @ORGANIZATION1 by the way he named his children it's apparent that his sense of humor is a little bit off, but he's a really hard working man. Occasionally my mom does him favors by taking the twins off his hands for a little while because they can be a handful. Weekends are specifically better to have them over because of my hateful step siblings whom hate me, my brother, my sister, @ORGANIZATION1 even my mom. The amount of tension in the house isn't a healthy amount, so a couple of @NUM1 @DATE1 old running around livens it up a little @ORGANIZATION1 makes us all laugh together as a family. It must have been @DATE1 in @DATE2 when @CAPS7 was home @ORGANIZATION1 we were building onto our house when the twins came over. My mom was getting quite furious at their insanely high energy levels, she appeared to be on the verge of ripping out all her hair. My step dad @PERSON1 needed to go to @PERSON2's for nails @ORGANIZATION1 child locks @ORGANIZATION1 I decided to tag along with him. I thought it would have been a great idea to take the twins with us, just to relieve my mom of the loud mouths for a few minutes. We loaded up the car @ORGANIZATION1 I drove down the highway, amused with the twins in the back seat playing with the ponies @ORGANIZATION1 laughing at the people stopped at red lights. We all sang songs like twinkle twinkle little star, @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION2's until we arrived in the @PERSON2's parking lot. @ORGANIZATION1 finds it pretty hilarious to run down the isles @ORGANIZATION1 hide behind items on the lower shelves, while @ORGANIZATION1 enjoys pretending he's @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 getting @CAPS7 confused. Eventually the twins were being too obnoxious, resulting in @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 me catching them @ORGANIZATION1 holding them as captives in the seat-belts of the @PERSON2's cart. It was helpful but didn't do as much justice as we had hoped. We continued along on our adventure in search of the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 found them down isle @NUM4. There was a large man standing in front of our destination @ORGANIZATION1 when i say large I don't mean muscular, or tall... I mean he probably has a few too many @CAPS1 shows he watches daily, @ORGANIZATION1 maybe a few too many favorite snacks. His hair was long @ORGANIZATION1 sandy blond, he wore a dark purple @CAPS2 die shirt @ORGANIZATION1 slip on sandals. @ORGANIZATION1 apparently hadn't realized how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude fashion, especially when they can hear you. He said, ""@CAPS3 cow @ORGANIZATION1 look at that lady! She's so huge!"" @ORGANIZATION1 laughed outrageously @ORGANIZATION1 agreed. ""@CAPS4! She's as big as our whole car!"" I panicked a bit @ORGANIZATION1 tried to get them to be quiet, however the twins paid @CAPS5 attention to me, they were much more excited to see the man on the tall ladder next to me giggling @ORGANIZATION1 laughing along with them.

The man turned around @ORGANIZATION1 glared at me; i apologized at least @NUM5 times @ORGANIZATION1 started to take the boys out of the isle when the man on the ladder hit a button to make the ladder move. I was walking behind the larger man when the ladder made a ridiculously loud beeping sound, like that of a construction vehicle. The boys screamed in fear @ORGANIZATION1 shouted frantically, ""@CAPS6 run as fast as you can hurry! She's backing up @ORGANIZATION1 she's going to squish you on the floor!"" @CAPS7 laughed, even the man they were making fun of, but i was so embarrassed that i just took them to the car @ORGANIZATION1 waited for @PERSON1. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when they are backing up, but unsurprisingly, they didn't listen to a word i said. @PERSON1 only took approximately @NUM6 more minutes before he came jogging out the door with the nails, the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 a gigantic smile plastered on his face. I thought about what had happened in the store @ORGANIZATION1 i chuckled quietly until @PERSON1 hopped into the truck, then i started laughing profusely. When I returned home I told my mom what had happened, she laughed for a while @ORGANIZATION1 i laughed even harder @ORGANIZATION1 quite a bit longer than i had before. I went to sleep with a fairly massive headache that night, but i think it was worth laughing all day for.",23.0,16.0,44.0,44.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4,16,,": The essay tells a true story in which laughter was an element.

20733,8," People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. Makes a you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing , having fun? I have and sometimes i feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship"".  She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing everytime she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, everytime she had the chance to hang out with him. Everytime she could think about him she would smile and laugh. Thats how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy everytime she talks about him, but i still dont know if laughter is @CAPS2 kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother everytime she says, ""@CAPS1 didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knew how put a smile on my face"". Because she says that @CAPS1 wasn't so smart but @CAPS1 knew how to make jokes, and make her laugh. A question she asked me once ""@CAPS2 do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time"". The first thing that pops to your head is that they know how to have fun and doesnt let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a goodtimes. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you dont know howe to make the other person laugh you dont know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never last to long because my gandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldnt be together still. I understand now my grandmother felt in love with my grandpa, because of how @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you dont know than pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship.They alwasy know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make my self laugh. That's @CAPS2 makes our family relationship stick together, and other familys also.I finally get it laughter is a big part in a relationship.",18.0,18.0,,36.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,3,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20734,8,"    ""Laughter is the best medicine."" The phrase almost everyone has heard before. But it'@CAPS20 true! I've had days when all I could think about was how @CAPS23 life sucked, or at least seemed to. The days when you feel like everything is going wrong, and nothing could make it worse... And that'@CAPS20 when one of @CAPS14 best friends will make me laugh. I'll laugh so hard I'm on the verge of @CAPS19 @CAPS14 pants and @CAPS14 eyes water. I'll laugh so hard no sound comes out, @CAPS14 sides cramp and I fall on the floor. They make me laugh so hard, sometimes I think that even if I was in a coma, they'd say something so funny that I'd sit straight up in the hospital bed and @CAPS21 laugh the huge belly laugh that sometimes escapes me.    There was this particular time when @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I were feeling more giggly than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was way different than the others. We staggered to @CAPS1'@CAPS20 house flushed and giddy at how funny everything was. You know how it is when you and your best friends @CAPS9 @CAPS21 @CAPS13 so tickled by each other? Those times when you glance at your friend and @CAPS21 as you've begun to calm down, you see her pinched expression from trying not to laugh, and you lose it all over again. If you've ever had the pleasure of experiencing these silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours at a time. I'm pretty sure I developed a whole new set of abdominal muscles that day, if that gives you any idea how hard we were laughing.    Anyway, we stumbled into her house, trying to get serious, since we did have to do at least some of our homework. Of course we were starving after all that laughing, so @CAPS1 told @ORGANIZATION1 and me that we could get some cereal. @CAPS21 regular milk and cereal, right? There'@CAPS20 nothing @CAPS22 special about @CAPS4'n @CAPS5 (besides that it'@CAPS20 freaking delicious). But on that day, everything was out of the ordinary, especially the milk. It was the most amazing milk I'd ever tasted, and I @CAPS6, @CAPS6, @CAPS6, milk, so that had to mean something. ""@CAPS7 this milk is so good! @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8!"" @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed. I swear she was about to choke on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. ""@CAPS9 you kidding me with this? What kind of milk do you buy?!"" I blurted out. For some reason that milk was really extraordinary, and it was seriously blowing @CAPS14 mind. ""@CAPS10, I don'@CAPS17 know. Two percent?""@CAPS1 looked at us incredulously, a curious eyebrow raised at our inquiries. Her expression made us all fall apart in peals of laughter. Now whenever one of us brings it up, we still laugh like it @CAPS21 happened.    @TIME1, it happened. @CAPS1 peed her pants, and not @CAPS21 a little. It wasn'@CAPS17 @CAPS21 the idle threat rushed out, the ""@CAPS12'mgoingtopee!"" squeal. @CAPS13 no. She actually peed herself, and I still @CAPS16'@CAPS17 even remember what I said to make her laugh that hard. All I know is suddenly (scaring me half way to death), she yelled out, ""@CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8 I @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS18 @CAPS19! THERE'@CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24!!"" I whipped around and saw @CAPS1, red-faced and open-mouthed, supporting herself against the counter. She looked like the freaking @CAPS26 @CAPS27 of @LOCATION1 all bent over like she was. Her eyes were closed tight, crinkling at the corners, a few stray tears escaping as she tried to hold in shrieks of (apparently) crippling laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, and then I was totally straight out laughing at her; pointing and laughing @CAPS14 shoulder-shake laugh, and it only made her laugh harder. Still laughing, she did a penguin-type run down the hall to the bathroom, where @DATE1 was. @CAPS1, in her wet jeans and with a red, tear streaked face, burst through the bathroom door, looking slightly bewildered and amused with what @CAPS21 happened. So naturally, @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at the sight of her, in her comically delirious state. Who wouldn'@CAPS17 have?   The fact that we @CAPS16 always laugh at each other and ourselves is why I love @CAPS14 friends . It'@CAPS20 great when you have people that you @CAPS16 laugh about everything and nothing with. @CAPS1 is practically a walking ego boost because she laughs at every joke, and @ORGANIZATION1'@CAPS20 pretty clever when it comes to thinking of them. Personally, I love laughing, especially with (and mostly at) @CAPS14 best friends.    ",23.0,20.0,,43.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20736,8,"               ""Laughter"" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grow and really started thinking for myself I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure trust is important but @CAPS2 isn't the only key factor, I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping @CAPS2 full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate. Sure we have hard times just like any family, but we are able tolaugh @CAPS2 off with time and start new. @CAPS5 helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quite.Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried @CAPS5 would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever @CAPS5 would joke around with me I would take @CAPS2 all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things I thought @CAPS5 would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner my mom had informed me that @CAPS2 was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. @CAPS5 said, ""@PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. @CAPS5 followed me into the small bright room, ""@PERSON1? Are you alright, @CAPS2's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" @CAPS5 exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes @CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, @CAPS5 looked worried. @CAPS5 explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that @CAPS5 so desperately wanted to have with me. @CAPS5 told me about how they would @CAPS3 together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then @CAPS3. ""@CAPS3? What? Why would you guys do that?"" I questioned.  @CAPS5 replied, "" @CAPS4 laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say."" @CAPS5 helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the fist time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can @CAPS3 off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""

20737,8," Laughter. A story about laughter is what you want to hear? Well my life is filled with laughter and smiling. Crazy I know! If it wasn't for laughing I would not have the six pack that I have today. Have you ever stopped to think about when one person can make another person laugh they usually become really close friends maybe even best friends? My boyfriend is my best friend. This one time my boyfriend and I were laughing so hard. My boyfriend is my life. I spend pretty much everyday with him, he is so amazing. Me and him well we do everything together. He is very close to me. He is the best best friend anyone could ask for! I've only known him for about a year, a lot can happen in one year. You can meet new people, build relationships, and even move away from those relationships you just made. Me and @PERSON1 we are always laughing, at each other and at other things as well. We always have fun times with each other. It was a late @DATE1 @TIME1 and he was walking me home like he always did before. There is this field with extremely tall grass and we were walking right next to it. All of a sudden out of no where he acts like he is getting pulled into the grass. So guess what I did, I screamed as loud as I could possibly scream! Then he starts calling my name in a creepy voice telling me to come over to the grass. Out of curiosity of what just happened I start walking over towards the tall grass. When I arrived to the spot where he entered the grass he tells me ""@CAPS1 I lost my shoe and I can't seem to find it anywhere!"" @PERSON1 and I start looking everywhere for his shoe. We couldn't see anything because it was really dark, so we used our hands to search around for his shoe, ""I found it!"" I said. After we found the shoe we realized two hours went by. We were so tired we laid down in the grass to take and break and we both started cracking up with laughter because of how ridiculous it was that we spent two hours on something that was suppose to be a little joke! it was so awesome. When we finally got to our feet our bellies hurt so bad and were very sore. I have never laughed harder than that in my life. Every time I'm with @PERSON1 is the best time ever. We always seem to find a way to make each other laugh. Without best friends or even just friends you would probably find it hard to laugh. With friends you always have someone to laugh at and also laugh with. This is why i cherish my best friend @PERSON1 and all the happy and laughing times we have together, because you'll never know when the last time you'll see that person will be. I try to be as happy as I can and I try to always make people laugh because laughter is the best way of exercise.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20739,8," Laughter is a big part in my relationship. I feel so much more connected with a person if we laugh together. Laughing make's you feel great. You could be in a depression stage and either a friend or a family member could walk up to you and pacify you and make you laugh. If I had a relationship that had no laughter in it, I would leave that person as fast as I could. Some people think relationships are only about money and/or looks.People now and days don't last that long in a relationship. Back in the old days people would die together, and even in death they would have there graves right by each other. My boyfriends name is @PERSON1. We have been going out for four years now. He is a very funny, I love his jokes. Sometimes he doesn't even try to make a joke, but he does anyway. When we where first going out, I was throwing a birthday party and me, @PERSON1 and one of his friends went in the woods and hid from everyone else. When the others came to find us we jumped out and scared them. They where mad at us, but when night fall came we where all laughing about it together. My mom and dad don't really laugh together that much. They just go to @ORGANIZATION1 with each other and come home together. My dad loves to crack jokes now and then, but my mom is the kind of person who likes to laugh at the other people that gets hurt. My grandma is so funny. She try's to make people laugh and hurt them selves so she can get a kick out of it. All of my friends are funny. My best friend @LOCATION1 is the funniest girl I have ever known. She likes to dance funny and mock people that she doesn't like. When she works, she'll try to find something to make a joke out of, so she could bring it to me and almost make me pee my pants. @LOCATION1's relationship was very bad. She loves to laugh but her boyfriend hates making jokes. She tried to stick it out but things got worse and worse. The only thing he would do is sit on his bed or his couch and play video games, or watch wrestling. He would make @LOCATION1 clean his room and do the dishes. He has a one year old sister and he makes her watch her,clean her, and feed her while he was up in hie room playing video games. @LOCATION1 got so tired of it , so she packed her stuff and she left. She went to her sisters house. Now she has a funny boyfriend and they always laugh together. There can be a laughing relationship with animals as well as humans.Animals are the one thing that cant talk back or make fun of you. Animals are just like humans, but they cant talk and they have fur. My cat is the king of my house. His name is @CAPS1. He loves to follow me all over my house. I love to sit on the floor and watch him wrestle with all of the other cats.Every time I go into the kitchen he is always there with me, bagging for food. After he eats, he gets an erg of energy and runs all over the house. It makes me laugh. He will stop right in front of me and just stare at me, if I move then he will run away. Cats are cute but not all of them have the power to look into your soul like my cat. @CAPS1 has big eyes and his meow is so sweet and incessant. The funniest thing about him is how fat he is. He is a fat cat, but he is only one years old. So when I see him running all over the place it makes me laugh. My horse is the same way. His name is @CAPS2, and he is four years old. He is a crazy horse, but at the same time he is very funny. He try's to play with my other horses and get hurt because he bites them, so they kick him back. He has a blue eye, so I bought him for my purposes. Some people thinks horses are just a bill, but I think they are my family.",15.0,15.0,,30.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

20741,8," Everyone enjoys laughter. Everywhere you look there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Many times in my life I have had joy. I tend to laugh many times throughout the day on account of I am happy. One topic that brings me laughter is my niece. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 is two years old. She is the most adorable little girl in the world. At least in my opinion she is. Since she is so young she does not have a care or worry in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case she is full of joy, and happiness, which causes her laughter. When I am with her all that takes place is laughter, and playing. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS3 has this cookie jar, and when ever you put the shapes into the right slots it sings a silly little song. This song makes her laugh, and dance uncontrollably. Which in return gets me laughing. It soon ends up being a huge laugh fest. These are the greatest moments. Recently we had another addition added to the family. @PERSON1, my nephew, and @CAPS2 brother. As @PERSON1 gets older, he keeps learning new things, and @CAPS3 loves it. She laughs harder then ever. She thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see laughter is happy, and fun. Laughter starts with smiling, and smiling is also rooted from being happy. Many things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew is just one example. What makes you laugh and smile?",15.0,20.0,,35.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,3,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20742,8," Why is it that laughter can bring people so close together? Is it because laughing shows trust for one another, or is it simply because you understand each other. There many different kinds of laughter, like cracking a joke, or someone does something very embarrassing. The story that I will be telling is about how such a bad day for hunting turned into the funniest moments ever.   It all started in the @TIME1 when I woke up, and I had forgotten to put my wet clothes that were in the washer machine to the dryer. Now I had to dig through all my clothes up in my room and find camouflage clothes that weren't dirty, or were something that I could wear. By this time anybody would be in a bad mood, and trying rush to get out the door. When my buddy @PERSON1 showed up and was ready to go and I wasn't. I was rushing, and when you rush you are bound to forget something, and I had left my gun at the house. Five miles down the road I noticed that I had forgotten my gun, so we turned around and went back to go get it. Not only now we were late, we were speeding to the cabin for breakfast, @PERSON1 had the eggs so that we could make omelets. As we are racing down, we hit a bump in the road and everything, I mean everything hit the ceiling in the truck and then slammed to the floor. In doing this all the eggs broke in the egg carton, so now we had no eggs, and no eggs meant no breakfast.  Its about thirty minutes till shooting hours, and we are late showing up to the blind so that @PERSON1 and I can meet up with our other friends, @PERSON3 and @PERSON2. Finally we get to the blind right before sunrise and while we are getting all set up, a group of twenty mallards drop in unexpected and took off before we could get a shot off. Now were all thinking great their goes our opportunity to redeem ourselves from a terrible @TIME1. Only to find out that those ducks were the only ducks we saw all day.   At around twelve o'clock we gave up, and went back up to the cabin, but on the way up we got stuck in two inches of water in a truck. I remember thinking to myself, ""@CAPS1 this is not really happening to us right now"". So @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and I got out of the truck to push, and @PERSON1 stayed in the truck to drive. Their were many attempts to push the truck out, and finally on the sixth try we pushed the truck hard enough to get it out of the muddy water. Now the funny part, when we had broke the truck free @PERSON1 laid on the gas causing the truck tires to spin, and spray mud everywhere. When I saw the amount of mud being hurled everywhere I jumped behind @PERSON2 and used him as a shield from the mud. By this point @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 are @CAPS2 in a inch thick layer of mud from head to toe. You couldn't help but laugh, it was the funniest thing ever. @PERSON1 had watched it all through his rear view mirror and as soon as he was safe from getting the truck stuck again, he fell out of the truck because he was laughing so hard. Even @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 were laughing a bit too.  So when its a day when nothing goes your way or having bad luck, you never know what the day has planned for, in this case its one of the most memorable things I remember that happened that duck season.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay has a clear main idea and supporting details.

I am really freaking bored!"" @CAPS2 explained as all of us relaxed next too his dark blue @CAPS3 which was gracefully parked right out side of my house. The @ORGANIZATION1 was young and as young boys we needed something to do. Gears started to turn in my head! As i thought of a bullet proof plan that would be very funny.  ""@CAPS4 I've got it!"" I yelped. ""@CAPS1 here it, I'm really down for anything right @CAPS21,"" @CAPS6 quickly replied. ""@CAPS7 since @CAPS2 has car he can drive into town and buy some cheap saran rap then @CAPS15 back to the four way intersection right out side of my neighborhood and tie the rap around two of the trees on opposite sides of the street so cars will speed through it!"" I quick explained as i ran out of breath. Bursts of loud laughter came from all directions were my friends were standing as I came to realization that this idea was golden. ""I will drive and go get it, but does anyone got some money too pitch in!"" @CAPS2 pounced as @LOCATION2, @CAPS6 and I, handed single bills to him.  "" that's plenty! give me a few minutes then we can meet at the intersection right out side of @CAPS10's neighborhood."" @CAPS2 said as he brushed everyone off his car and begin to dip out of my neighborhood. ""@CAPS12 text me when you're about to get back!"" I screamed to @CAPS2 as sound of his poorly maintained engine bellowed in the @TIME1 sky. Minutes flew by and the rest of us just sat down on the curb, talked, and waited for @CAPS2. Ring ting my custom ring tone for incoming texts sounded. My eyes quickly scanned the phone's contents and concluded that @CAPS2 was ready with the saran rap at the four way intersection.  ""@CAPS15 on @CAPS1 @CAPS4 go! @CAPS2 is ready and so @CAPS1 do this thing"" I muttered as i grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit of my neighborhood. @CAPS6 trailed, as @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 brought up the back. i yelled once again to enhance the passe. @CAPS2's car lights lit up the @ORGANIZATION1 air as he made a blinking signal to express where he was to us. All four of us quickly jogged over to the drive way of a house that was for sale right near the exit of my neighborhood to where @CAPS2 was parked. ""@CAPS17 you @CAPS4 long enough,"" @CAPS2 explained. ""well we are all here! so @CAPS1 go to the intersection and set this up!"" @PERSON1 explained as the started too lead toward the intersection which was about fifty yards away. As we reached the intersection there were no cars! We all @CAPS17 to this opportunity and @NUM1 and @PERSON1 look out for cars!"" i yelled as @CAPS2 and i began the process. Quickly i opened the saran rap and ran crossed the road, uncoiling the rap as i went. Soon as @CAPS2 and I were both on opposite sides of the street we both started to firmly rap the saran around trees we have already pick out. Once i pulled and inspected it finding that it was prefect i sprinted to a short fence that was a boarder for the neighborhood on one side of the intersection. i was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding. ""haha this is prefect! i am made sure everything feels right!"" I explained as we all gazed upon delicately hung rap than ran from both sides of the two way street. ""@CAPS21 we must wait,"" @PERSON2 said as anticipation fell into place. Four heads bobbed up and down as we checked to see if cars were driving down the road. Since it was about @NUM2 pm most of the good folk of @LOCATION1 were sleeping or inside. But suddenly a car came out of @CAPS21 were, speeding and only @NUM3 yards from the great prank. ""@CAPS22,"" i yelled as the car continued driving closer and closer. Boom! The car speed through the saran rap, then came to a screeching stop. Laughter burst out as the inspected target was completely in disarray. But the anger male driver hearing our laughing decided too leave his car and chase us! ""@CAPS23 up,"" I screamed! We all @CAPS23 right as the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Although it was too late for @CAPS6! The anger man caught him as the rest of us all high tailed it for my house. As soon as we reached my house we all began too ask our self's what happened too @CAPS6! Suddenly out of @CAPS21 where @CAPS6 came running, as he @CAPS22 reached us we started too burst into laughter once again! The whole left side of @CAPS6 was dripping with soda! @CAPS6 would never tell us what happened that @ORGANIZATION1 although we could have guessed!

20746,8," In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over ""are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown"" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back ""yes, @CAPS1 I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. ""then why cant you not laugh?"" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. ""its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to"" and I said ""well why on earth would you do that?"" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. ""allright if you don't stop this"" he said in a gental but strained voice, ""im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year"" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE1 I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, ""my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york"". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. ""@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh"" he said and went on ""like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile"". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked ""why though? why would someone tease you, your nice"" and he repled ""because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great"". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again ""then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me"" he said ""I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to"" I said ""really!?"" with too much excitment. ""yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE2 and a little laughter.",17.0,16.0,,33.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20747,8," These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody.",18.0,20.0,,38.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":**

20748,8,"Friends are'nt always what we want them to be they arent always easy to find, but with a smile and a laugh a friendship can become. I mean what is a friendship if there isnt those moments where you laugh until you pee. When you laugh until you can't breath and you feel like you have just done one hundred sit-ups. Ofcourse you @MONTH1 meet a friend like this and it @MONTH1 happen when you least expect it. I didnt expect a new friendship but in a new town and with new people i met the friend i now call bestfriend.  It was the year of @NUM1 and i was new to @ORGANIZATION1. In homeroom everyone stared at me like i was some kind of criminal and everyone talked behind my back when i would pass by their desks, well atleast thats how i felt. My homeroom teacher @PERSON2 @CAPS1 me my so called schedule. Sixth period, @CAPS2 class with @PERSON1. What? @CAPS2, what is that. I really had no idea what a @CAPS2 was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a @CAPS2 was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. @PERSON1 asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was @PERSON3 and she told me her name was @CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a ""friend"" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the @CAPS2, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping @CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.  We are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart. We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It braught my friendship with a person i had barley met into a friendship that is now insepreable and amazing. ",19.0,17.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

20751,8,"  It was a normal bright and warm @DATE1 day, going into my fifth grade year. My older sister and I had been playing all day with my other neighbors that were around our age. One of those neighbors happened to be a boy. We could not find anything to do. It was too hot out to just go walk around in the sun, so we decided that it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @CAPS1 had made. He made it out of an old swing set seat and I thought my neighbor would really enjoy it.  We all headed into our garage to get it. My sister offered to get it down for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high, but I refused. It was my idea to show him so I would be the one to get it. As I was in total concentration, stretching and reaching to grab it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration got weaker as I begun to wonder what they were all laughing at. I stood there confused for a minute before I had found out what happened. My sister pulled down my pants.. in front of our boy neighbor. I picked my pants up off the ground, looked straight at my sister, and started beating her with my flimsy loose fists. I ran straight to my room, crying all the way there.   My sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit role ups. She sat on my bed waiting for a half an hour, I didn't budge. She did not say anything but I could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets. Later that night I finally came out. My sister kept on apologizing but it didn't matter to me because I was upset with her, that's all that mattered. The whole next day passed and nothing had changed. She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignoring mood. My @CAPS1 came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because I was not talking to her. I thought in my head, "" how could she be upset.."" but I realized I had not treated her right, even though I wasn't happy with her.   After hearing what my @CAPS1 had said, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I went and talked to my sister for the first time in days. She told me that she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just messing around. After talking about it for a while I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We joke around like that all the time, but it's never in front of anyone besides family. I was scared that it would have frightened our neighbor friend away, but he was back to play in a few days so I had nothing to be mad about.   Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted that it was pretty funny. We had a good laugh about it and were no longer enemies. I learned that dwelling over the past gets you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh things off. Ever since then, every time it is brought up, we laugh so hard tears role down our face. I would not have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I do now. It is another memory that my sister and I share and can reminisce about. The more laughable memories you share, the closer it brings you to some one.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The writing is clear and focused.

20754,8,"Making someone laugh is the best feeling to their soul, and it is one step closer to internal happiness. People might say that when feeling something good inside the body its when they know that they have done something right. I agree with this because it has happen to me; I was feeling down about something that I cant even remember but, when I felt the need to help someone do something I knew inside of me that I did something very special at that moment. It's amazing how you make someone laugh, and it doesn't matter where you are, you also feel happy. The one person in my life that has a great sense of humor is my mother. She is always in need of something funny.People enjoy laughing so much that it is if they were to take some sort of energy drink to make them not want to stop laughing. I hear people say that laughter is very healthy for a human soul, and it will also make the soul and body last longer. Laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say much. It could be a great way to start a conversation with a person. Positive thinking leads to making good choices especially if happiness leads you on in life. By making someone laugh it makes the awkwardness go away. It is better to laugh then to be sad.Everyone has their addiction to something in which they need to depend on. My mom's addiction is laughing. She laughs at work and she especially laughs at the house whenever I'm around. Although, sometimes she feels down whenever something goes wrong. I hate seeing her like this, because it then makes me feel down. When she is feeling sad it is if there is nothing in the world that would make her cheer up. If one person is feeling depress, that feeling passes on to the next person closest to them. Eventually I get tiered of seeing my mom like this and in this situation I cant help it but to get up and start doing some ridiculous stuff to cheer her up. Some things that pop into my mind is that I can start dancing funny or tell a little lie that might of happen at school that I think will cheer her up. When there is an opportunity to make someone laugh I enjoy to put a smile on their face.My mom means the world to me just as I mean the world to her. We try to help each other in any way as possible. This one day she came home from work and my dad was sitting in the table reading the newspaper and my mom walks in, and notices that my dad hasn't made food yet she started to flip out on him. She thought that it was stupid of him to not make dinner for us. She was pretty angry at him for a period of time, so she started to make us dinner but she was doing it all wrong. She was mixing the spices in the wrong pan, I was going to let her know that she was doing it all wrong, but my dad was holding me back so that I wouldn't get her more angry. She finally finish cooking and served us our plates but we didn't wanted to eat it because she made the food out of anger and made it smell funky. My dad forced us to eat it because he thought that by eating the food it would make her happy, but he was wrong it only made her feel worse because my youngest brother didn't like it. I felt bad so I had to do something funny that was going to put her in the mood to not be mad at my dad anymore. I turn on the @CAPS1 and changed the @CAPS2 to the music @CAPS2 and started to dance as if I were to have ants in my pants. Her lungs were about to burst because she was laughing so hard, and eventually she was in a good mood for the rest of the day.Everywhere I go I see people smiling and laughing about something and it only makes me wonder about the funny things that are being said. I think that it is a good thing for someone to feel good about themselves because it brings a positive feeling in the room. I enjoy to see people be happy because it always makes me feel happy. What better way to be happy when smiling is one step closer to laughing. My mom and I like to take walks just so that we wouldn't feel apart and stay closer to each other, we see different people each time we go walking and we always get a smile from them. That is the best feeling in the world, to feel joy is to be free from all your problems.",16.0,15.0,,31.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

I was sitting in @CAPS2 class one day, and was bored out of my mind. Then, a shy, quiet kid, all of a sudden started laughing! @CAPS3 couldn't stop! It was like @CAPS3 was on ""laughing gas."" @CAPS3 laughed so hard @CAPS3 couldn't breathe. Now this made me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me laugh. Soon enough the entire class was laughing! So even though some of the people in @CAPS2 class might have been bored, or had a bad day, the laughter was spread throughout the room, making it a better day. Laughter spreads like wildfire, and it makes everyone happier. And when you are happier, you are healthier. So with that, a @CAPS2 relationship must have laughter in it, in order to work. When you ask someone what they like about there boyfriend or girlfriend, if it is a @CAPS2 relationship, they will almost always say, ""@CAPS3/she makes me laugh."" @CAPS5 when you don't have laughter in a relationship, you end up in more fights, more disagreements, and more disappointment.

20756,8," Their are many joys in life, some are more relevant then the others, and some are so obvious you'd be stupid no to notice them. Have you ever just sat on your porch or stared out the window just to watch the sun rise, as you sat there pondering your life and its unusual qualities, you think of all the great memories, all the laughs you have shared, all the sorrows, all the pain ,and all the love and hate. Its not surprising that almost everyone has done just that and they wonder if they could change things, how would they do that, or would they leave it the way it started out, filling their life is complete and they are complete as well, not having any regrets.  For all the tears I have cried and all the pain I've been through there has always been a laugh to top the sadness. some time I to sit and pander my life, although i have not lived long and my real experiences are yet to come, I have been through a great deal in my short experiences, but it does not trouble me, for i have taken in what has happened during my time period and I have learned a great deal form it. I've learned that no matter how hard you try you can never fully plain your life theirs always going to be something or someone unexpected, all you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Its not hard to be happy, just keep an open mind and a light heart, and soon you will find yourself laughing with the rest of the world and enjoying your short time on this amazing planet we call @LOCATION1, so listen to your mother and father or even the person you look up to most in life.  There are many things that keep me going, like my boyfriend or my love for animals, but the most important thing i can think of isn't just one thing its a collection of things, such as love, laughter, new beginnings and old endings, a bright and new path (all you have to do is take it) , the relentlessness of the universe, and the idea that there @MONTH1 be other planets out there that sustain life, maybe even intelligent life. Its easy to find things to live for and even easier to find things to die for, hopefully you look for things to live for. I remember when it was hard and I thought I would never ever be happy and I felt like I wasn't right for this world and its many confusing aspects. I was at the end of my path or so I was making it out to be, but then something happened as I sat on the side of an old road. I looked up at the stars and thought what would i miss out on if I ended my path now, what would I dare to name my child or children for that matter if I even have the chance to produce any.Who would I marry if i marry, will our love last or fade like morning due. so I finally decided that there was to much i would not experience if I ended it this soon. after that fateful evening I went about my life slowly molding into a better person who wanted a bright future with a romantically new but burning love story to tell to my child or children, and with devotion, trust,and respect would hopefully last. but that's not all I would want my adventure to consist of. I would want to find peace of mind in a place where silence is a scarcity, I want to help bring out the possibility of sharing the world with animals not pushing them aside or abusing their natural right to be on this @LOCATION1 along side us, I want to solve the pollution problem that we humans have more then helped produce. i suppose in my small way i will because in just one person and a every small thing on this very big home of ours, but as small as I am what i do or say will make an impact. so if I want something to look back and laugh on i had bettered to what i consider my part and making this planet a shared and healthy planet.",18.0,16.0,,34.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

At the some time when @PERSON1 was having fun their was a girl named @ORGANIZATION1 who didn't talk much to @PERSON1 at all, but she liked him and she didn't tell a whole lot of people. @ORGANIZATION1 also tried to make as many friends as she could when doing the plays and spent as much time with her friends as she could. As the play stared to end @PERSON1 stared to hang out with @PERSON2 who is @ORGANIZATION1 older brother and stared to pay a little more attention to her and found out from her brother that she liked @PERSON1, but @PERSON1 already knew that she did like him from the way she acted around @PERSON1. @PERSON1 joined another play called""@CAPS2 in @LOCATION1"" after doing""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"" because of how much fun he had in doing the first play. @PERSON1 found he already knew most of the people form doing the first play. So he stared talking to the rest of the people that was their that @PERSON1 didn't knew already. This is when @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 stared talking to each other and both of them found that they enjoyed each others laughter they became vary close friends. they became such close friends vary fast because of how @PERSON1 like to make friends vary easy and @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't have vary many friends or close friends or it could have been the fact that @ORGANIZATION1 liked him so much. @ORGANIZATION1 didn't have vary many friends because the kids at school would make fun of her for being so smart and then she go home schooled and lost some of her only friends that she had. @PERSON1 soon found out in their friendship @ORGANIZATION1 was scared of of @PERSON1 not wanting to be her friend because of all the friends she had already lost. By the time that the play was starting to come to an end @PERSON1 had already noticed that @ORGANIZATION1 had liked @PERSON1 before they were friends and he asked her if she did like him she said no at first, but then she felt bad for lining to him and told him the truth about how she did like him and how she thought that is would be best if they just stay as friends. Both of them knew that they could only be friends because of their age difference. @PERSON1 was @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 was @NUM2. So they both knew that it would have never have worked out because of their age. So they both agreed that is would be best if they just stay as friends. As the play was ending the used every minute of it to grow their friendship. By the end of the play they both have became close friends and enjoyed the the good times that they had together and also enjoyed the laughter of one another.  Even after the play both of them still talked when ever they had the time to talk to each other, but they didn't get to see each much of each other. When they had the time to talk they talked about the good times that they had with one another and how much fun they had. They also talked about the great and fun that they had in doing the plays. Both of them agreed that they would do the plays again next @DATE1 and looked forward to seeing each other next @DATE1 and how many great thing that they will have to talk about.

20758,8," I never thought that laughing can help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS4 can. Just by laughing with someone can get you to meet a new person. One of the things I do first @CAPS6 someone is trying to be funny is laugh. Once you know @CAPS2 the other person is talking about, you forget that you are just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. @CAPS4 happened in @LOCATION1, where my family and I usually go every year in @DATE1. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know, @LOCATION1 is a hot place and the sun is usually out every day. I spend the days we stay over there going out to walk with my sister and cousins or going to the beach with all my family. I remember @CAPS4 was a day that my cousins, sister and I went to a small store that's right down the street from where we stay at. We wanted to buy candy and other stuff to bring with us @CAPS6 we returned to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. @CAPS6 I saw them, the only thing they were doing was laughing about something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer, I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help overhearing so I started to laugh. One of his friends saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him and of course I said no. I told him I had accidentally overheard his conversation so then he started to laugh. ""That was funny wasn't @CAPS4"" he told me laughing. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 was. I didn't know you made jokes like that"" I replied.  He kept on talking to me and then he said, ""I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I don't say @CAPS4 to hurt anyone.""  I thought @CAPS4 was nice for him to clear that out but I already knew people in @LOCATION1 talk like that. We kept on talking @CAPS6 I started to laugh again. ""@CAPS2 did I say now?"" he asked. ""@CAPS3. I was just remembering @CAPS2 you said in the beginning. That was really funny"" I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget of @CAPS2 he said and I don't think I will ever forget. I think @CAPS4 was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, by laughing first. I guess I thought @CAPS4 was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we are interested in their subject and we understand them. That's at least @CAPS2 I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was taking my vacations. I told him that every year I go and I always enjoy them. My family and I have a great time spending time with my grandparent and cousins from @LOCATION1. I told him I sometimes say I would rather live in @LOCATION1 than where I live know because @CAPS4's so much calmer there. He agreed with me on one part of @CAPS2 I had told him because he knows @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like to live in @LOCATION1, but he doesn't know how I's like to live in any other place. After he told me that, he stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation wasn't like in the beginning. In the beginning, we wouldn't stop laughing and we had interesting stuff to say. Then, @CAPS4 got calmer and a little unusual. I didn't want to just stop our conversation there so I asked him where was he going to go because @CAPS6 I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we started laughing again. This time @CAPS4 was because we just had noticed that the people we were with had left us. ""@CAPS6 did they leave?"" he asked me. ""I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't been talking for a long time,"" I told him. We walked together to go and look for them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were still looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We just got together with them and acted as if @CAPS3 had happened. @CAPS4 was strange for me because whenever I looked at him, I would remember our conversation. The first thing that would come to my mind was that we started our conversation by laughing at a funny thing he said. I actually liked making a new friend this way. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION1, I know I have a new friend over there and if I decide to, I can make other friends by simply laughing with them in their conversations.",23.0,18.0,40.0,40.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20759,8," As I waited in the car, anxious to meet my best friend and man I'm in love with, I started to laugh. Not because something my mother or brother said was funny, or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I'd talked to him countless times on the phone, many many text messages, and countless emails. But I was still nervous. I knew him better than I knew most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be making me lose my sanity.  As our black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside of where his family lived, I got more nervous. @CAPS6 if he wasn't actually the way I thought he was? @CAPS6 if he didn't like me? @CAPS6 if I didn't like him? As soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me, my nervous laughter and my anxiety all melted away. I smiled back. ""@CAPS1, @PERSON1,"" he said. ""@CAPS1 @PERSON2,"" I said, butterflies in my stomach. I was smiling broadly still, he reached out and cautiously took my hand.  ""@CAPS3 was the drive?"" he asked, lightly squeezing my hand. ""@CAPS4, and nerve wracking,"" I replied, nervous laughter bubbling up again. ""@CAPS5 your here now, and I'm very happy @CAPS7 are,"" he said, smiling. And for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly I thought I was dreaming. Here him and I were two guys in love with one another, a new thing for both of us, and we were happy as can be. The whole car ride we held hands ad talked, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. Not just the year and a half I'd known him.  We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 all too fast and all of us got out of the car, I was famished and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for a half-hour before we sat down. Once at the dinner table my mother, who was very happy I found someone I loved so much and knew of our love, started regaling us with tales of my childhood. It was one of the most embarassing moments of my life. I was bright red for almost the entire time she told these stories. Some of which I remembered, others I did not. @PERSON2 laughed and joked wth me about all of them. Which made my nervous laughter come out as actual laughter. It also helped that he was holding my hand under the table.  After we ate dinner and dessert we went to the nearby mall for some shopping and to just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and @PERSON2 and I went another. We bought some clothes together and finally ended up in a book store. My favorite book store, @ORGANIZATION3's. Back in my favorite section, young adult fiction, I noticed @PERSON2 staring at me. ""@CAPS6?"" I asked stupidly. He smiled deviously.  ""@CAPS7 just look very... In your element,"" he smirked.  ""@CAPS8?"" I said, in mock confusion. He just smiled and took my hand in his again. ""@CAPS9 problem,"" he said, squeezing my hand. He pulled me closer to him, we were the only people in this area of the store. ""@CAPS10 if I'm a little forward?"" he asked. I shook my head @CAPS9. He leaned in and kissed me very gently on the lips, I blushed a bright red and started to giggle after our lips parted. He quirked an eyebrow, I knew @CAPS6 he was thinking just by the look on his face.  ""That felt fantastic,"" I said, putting my fingers on my lips. I had a silly grin on my face.  ""@CAPS11,"" he simply said, kissing me again. ""I love your laugh, love,"" he told me, I was on cloud nine, I was truly in love with somebody and I felt great! I'd never been this happy before. Except maybe the first time I went to @ORGANIZATION2. But this was definitely better, because it could last much longer. Which it has, since we've been together ever since. Both our gazes fixed our future together. Now whenever I remember that I was start to giggle happily to myself. Yes I get a stare every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and I. Making us the closest we've ever been.",23.0,24.0,,47.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20760,8," Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS1. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade with physical science, fourth period. I had the first term with my best friend, @PERSON1, @CAPS12 we got to choose our seats, so we sat next to each other in the back, right hand corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could get away with more, like passing notes @CAPS12 talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook of notes, I most have written something that embarrassed her. So I went to grab something out of my backpack, @CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So next thing I knew, I was being shoved out of my desk, onto my backpack, on my back. The class got quiet, for he was giving us notes @CAPS12 showing us how to do the assignment. So as we erupted into fits o laughter, I looked at him to see if he was very angry @CAPS12 if he was going to send us outside of the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS1 did was look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @CAPS12 begin talking again. So, we kept laughing, but we were trying to settle down @CAPS12 stop ourselves from laughing. In the second term, @PERSON1 was @CAPS10 in there with me, but I had my friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4, @CAPS5.@CAPS5, @CAPS12 @PERSON2. i was even closer to @CAPS1 then in the first term. So, one day he was teaching us about compounds. So while he was writing down a chart to help us study, he sang out, ""@CAPS7 play the @CAPS8 @CAPS9!"" @CAPS10 even seconds later, the class burst with laughter, even he had to stop from writing he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS12 stop laughing. Another part of the second term that was a fun @CAPS12 a good laugh was doing some example problems on our own. So one of my classmates, @LOCATION2, asked what should we do to tell him we are finished with the problems. So @LOCATION1 thought for a few moments, @CAPS12 said, ""@CAPS11 you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me."" @CAPS12 about five minutes afterwords, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS12 with that, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more people were finishing their problems, it was getting annoying. It was hilarious at first though. Then there was @CAPS13 @CAPS14. We had just a regular classroom, @CAPS10 a science @CAPS13, so we were unable to do to many experiments. So @CAPS15, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @CAPS14, being as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using the matches, because his nickname for me was @CAPS16-@CAPS17. Then on the final day, he broke about @NUM1 to a dozen glass test tubes. @CAPS11 this happened, i was almost complete with my packet we had to do for the @CAPS14. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @CAPS12 I asked what happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @CAPS11 he did so. So @CAPS11 I looked at him, he started laughing. Which gave his cover away, so i got after him @CAPS12 told him @CAPS10 to blame the children for things he did. especially for breaking the test tubes. There was also the one time I went into his @CAPS18 class to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for one day, because she lvoed the class so much. So my guitar lessons teacher allowed me to spend fifth period in that class. So, @CAPS11 he was done giving notes @CAPS12 giving the class their assignment for the day. Some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 called him over for a question. So I looked up from my drawing. By then he was already over to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied he did swim. So then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he got embaressed, so he said to come after class @CAPS12 ask personal questions. So they just wanted a yes or no, so he explained, for about five minutes, that they shouldn't waste classtime for silly @CAPS12 personal question about him. I thought the entire time, ""@CAPS20 doesn't he just say yes or no?"" @CAPS21 were fun times that I will never forget @CAPS12 tell the day I die. No class, or science class will ever replace fourth period physical science. Nor any teacher replace @LOCATION1, he is @CAPS12 always will be my favorite teacher. I will forever remember the days of every phsycial science class, because of that one simple teacher.",15.0,15.0,30.0,30.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4,,,":**

20761,8," Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things @CAPS3 awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they @CAPS3 embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since i moved here six and @DATE1, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around @CAPS1 time. Even after my grandpa died in @DATE4 and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of @DATE2, we go secret @LOCATION1 shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we @CAPS3 going to go to that night. Second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we @CAPS3 going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty- five to thirty people on the list. All of which @CAPS3 family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister. She went off to college the @DATE3 before, leaving me the oldest grand kid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking it's tole. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking ""@CAPS2 great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome."" We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to ""his"" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever. My grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said "" @CAPS3 you going to sing or just stand there?"" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second ""happy birthday to you"" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We @CAPS3 all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breath, and he shut the door.  I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory i'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of ""what were you thinking"" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20762,8," Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the @NUM1 grade, i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i didn't know where anything really was, it was a new school: new bus, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be, you get made fun of alot and sometimes you just dont fit in. Well thats my story, i never fit in.  One day i was walking up the stairs to my class, and it was a bright sunny day, i dont believe there really was any clouds that day. Anyways, as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head, and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants. Well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me A. because i had just fell down, and @CAPS1. because i was wearing dora underpants. Therefore, i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, i laughed right along with them. I honestly thought it was pretty funny, falling down and your underpants show? who doesn't think that's funny? After the fact this girl named @CAPS2 came up to me and told me im not the only one who wears character underpants.We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid that could actually be taking embarssing, but for me I have done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. @CAPS2 and I, became such great friends, we laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water, or back to the time where i fell down the stairs. Up to this day we still talk about that, its just something you really don't get over. Not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my charcter underpants showed.  In conclusion, i think when the quote says ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" really is true, you have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day, its just a known fact. If you dont laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you. Just because your getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?",15.0,17.0,,32.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

20763,8,"                                   @ORGANIZATION1 blew my mind the first time I seen her. She was my other half. Everything we did together was perfect. She made me laugh with everything she said. She was my better half would sum it all up. I still remember when I first seen her in @CAPS1. The nickname of the town was @CAPS1 @CAPS4 hell because of where it was located, in the middle of nowhere. We met when I was on vacation at @CAPS1. My parents had just retired a few months before and were looking for a cozy retirement home away from the big city's and more closer @CAPS4 the good eastern @LOCATION2 mountains that seem @CAPS4 always have snowy tops and beautiful landscapes. We ended up staying there for a week or so in this little trailer that we took with us. That thing was hell on earth, every time we stopped I would have @CAPS4 set everything up even if we weren't going @CAPS4 use it. It was a two hour process and after the hundredth time you can see how I would get bored. looking for a great house @CAPS4 stay in that town was not hard @CAPS4 come by. They were all amazing homemade houses. Never was a contractor paid @CAPS4 build these houses because the men of the town made them by hand. They were incredible two story oak made houses that look like they could take a tornado coming out with only scratches. We ended up finding this one house that was so amazing that I wanted @CAPS4 live there right off the bat, surprisingly my parents wanted it @CAPS4. But the sad thing is is that we had @CAPS4 sell our house first or we wouldn't be able @CAPS4 afford it, so we put that house on the ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and headed back @CAPS4 the trailer.  We had another @NUM1 days or so there and I was officially bored out of my mind. I needed something @CAPS4 do besides stock the fire and make sure the hot dogs did not burn. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town ( the trailer park was located about half a mile out of town). I arrived in town @CAPS4 be very disappointing. It was just as boring riding a bike around town and stopping inside the shop @CAPS4 make small talk just as sitting by the fire in @NUM2 degree weather. In my mind it was just another boring vacation but little did I know it was about @CAPS4 get a lot more fun. I woke up the next day and took my shower and got ready for the day. It seemed like another boring day in hell from what I could tell. @CAPS4 me fun was doing stuff I normally would not do. But back then @CAPS1 and places like that just did not cut it because all I did that @DATE1 was go @CAPS4 places like this and do nothing so it was expected of me @CAPS4 be bored. I rode my bike around a corner and I saw a bunch of guys and girls that looked like they just came from fishing or tubing or something fun, so I rode over @CAPS4 see what was going on. I started talking @CAPS4 a guy named @CAPS8. He told me they just got back from a youth group get together on the snake were they went tubing and cliff jumping. I was in aw. That seemed crazy @CAPS4 me. Cliff jumping? Tubing? It seemed way @CAPS4 crazy for a youth group. But I guess that's just how they do things in @CAPS1. They just don't go have a picnic they go do crazy stuff that I personally have not done any of the things they were talking about because for one i not crazy and for two I have never had the chance. We kept talking and before they all left they invited me @CAPS4 go on there nature hike up on top of this mountain. I was more than happy @CAPS4 oblige seeing as I love hiking.  I woke up in the @TIME1 feeling all hipped up and ready @CAPS4 rock. I had my permission slip signed and I was ready for a good ole hike. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town at five in the @TIME1 and arrived at the youth administrators house just in time for a protein shake for breakfast ( he offered it @CAPS4 me I did not ask). We drove @CAPS4 the mountain and at the base there were around @NUM3 @CAPS4 @NUM4 people all in hiking gear. It surprised me because I was not expecting so many people. That's when I met @LOCATION1.

My friend and I started jumping on the trampoline and he was starting too jump higher then me and I started losing bounce and he came back down the same time as me, but he had more bounce, which made me bounce a lot higher then I normally could also he weighed more then me. So i came back down and I landed on my back and the angle I was at on the trampoline shot me off. As I was bounced off the trampoline I thought I was gonna get hurt and I had rather gotten a few scratches then landing on a dogs manure, but that's just what happen I landed on a pile of dog manure and it really stunk my shirt up so bad, but after i took my shirt off i started jumping again and i jumped for that whole day about but i don't regret it it because after that everyone had a good laugh including me. so @CAPS3 story was a part of laughter and how laughter is a great way to have fun and even when it @MONTH1 have been a bad thing that happen to you, maybe in the end it was funny even though at the time it was not.",15.0,15.0,,30.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

20765,8," @CAPS9 you ever been scared so much that you couldn't sleep the whole night? Were you with a group of @NUM1 friends at the time? Telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out. It starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and its time to party. It was called our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" night, we call it ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" because, us @CAPS5 kids, we consider ourselves as @CAPS1. Our night involves @NUM2 antsy @LOCATION1, @NUM1 frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be ""@CAPS6"".  To start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive at first. Everyone reached at my house around @NUM4 pm. We started out by playing videos games, laughing, having a good time, eating, playing board games. Just your average teenage party. That was, until the parents went upstairs to go to bed. Once they were settled in bed and fast asleep, we brought out the ""@CAPS7 or @CAPS8"" games. I bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version didn't you? Well, fortunately we are the @CAPS5 kids. Just your normal ""I @CAPS8 you to run around the house three times"" or ""@CAPS9 you ever kissed someone?"". Nothing unrated about that. After a while everyone just got bored of playing that redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do which was to play sing-star on the @NUM5, but @LOCATION3 brought the wrong cords over so we couldn't hook the console up. Since that didn't turn out as planned, we started to chat and capture pictures of the @CAPS1. Since this was our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"", it was definitely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as a @CAPS1. For our @CAPS1 role, it goes like this, I am the father, @PERSON3 is the mother, @LOCATION3 is the cat, @PERSON8 is the @CAPS12, @PERSON9, @PERSON5, @CAPS13 and @PERSON6 were my children, @PERSON1 is my brother, @PERSON7 is the strange atrocious woman, @PERSON4 is the sister in-law, and @LOCATION2 is our cable guy. This is how we all considered each other in the @CAPS1, so we all had to wear costumes that fit our personality traits for the photos. It took a while for everyone to concentrate and to stop bickering to each other, but we managed to cooperate and proceed with the photo shoot. After photos, it was time to fulfill our appetites. I ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @NUM6 different large pizzas. Hawaiian, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS19 @PERSON2, and @CAPS20. One by one, we all kept coming back for more. My ""daughter"" (@CAPS13) dropped her pizza onto the carpet and left a hulking red stain. We all started to pother. @PERSON9 got the cleaner, I got the rags, @PERSON4 got the @CAPS22, and @PERSON7 got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life. After the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and placed everything else away. Now it was @CAPS23 movie time. Snuggled up onto the couch with @NUM1 people all clutched together is the ""right"" way to contemplate a @CAPS23 movie. The movie we chose was called The @CAPS24. Every one sitting on top of every one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. Then, that's when it all happened... when @PERSON4 got up to use the bathroom, the @CAPS25 turned off, all the lights in the house shut down and we kept noticing shadows whisking across our living room walls. @CAPS13 started to cry, @LOCATION2 was complaining, @PERSON4 wouldn't go to the bathroom, and I was freaking out. Since none of the lights would turn back on, we all got in a circle on the carpet and started telling legitimately scary stories. Most of them were genuinely honest, and the others were said to be myths. There was one story that @PERSON6 portrayed about a possessed @CAPS26 that had no left leg and would go around terrorizing pedestrians. Well, it just so happened that I had a @LOCATION1 that had no left leg and when we started telling that story my @LOCATION1 started to freak out and assail all of my guests. So I grabbed my dog whistle and commanded them to cease, and dismiss. After all of the commotion, my parents never woke up and we all scurried up to my room to continue our discussion of @CAPS23 stories. During the whole process of the @CAPS2, the main lesson was that you can conquer any kind of fear as long as you @CAPS9 a sense of laughter and friends to back you up with it and that's what happened at the party. We were just hysterical about the whole situation and nobody ever left someone alone by themselves and always comforted them with laughter. By far I would @CAPS9 to say that was my favorite and most adequately funniest parties I @CAPS9 ever had.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20766,8," Laughter and exuberance are key elements in any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and joyful with someone close to @CAPS11 is a sign of comfort. It often can bring people closer and help to solidify their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago when I was in @PERSON1's seventh grade math class at @ORGANIZATION1, I was chosen to be in the @ORGANIZATION2 along with just three other classmates. Being in the @ORGANIZATION2 simply meant that we would be teaching ourselves @CAPS1-@CAPS2 using only textbooks, while @PERSON1 would teach the rest of the class an easier, more simple math. The @ORGANIZATION2 was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked upon us with jealousy because we got to sit in the back of the classroom together, never had to do any homework, and were never called upon out of the blue to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh graders that we were, we abused @TIME1 incredible opportunity that we had. I became fast friends with the three other people in the @ORGANIZATION2. Their names were @PERSON4, @PERSON3, and @CAPS3. @PERSON4 and I were already friends, but it was working together in the @ORGANIZATION2 that really brought us closer together. I also became close with @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3. To @TIME1 day, @PERSON4 is one of my very best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. @PERSON3 was caught up in the popular crowd, @CAPS3 usually hung out with the really smart kids who were into chess and reading books, and @PERSON4 and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence.  We each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy. We breezed right through the book and never really had any questions. In doing @CAPS8, we always finished our assigned work quickly and had more than half of the class left to just sit there, eat, and goof off. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's the order things played out in. ""@PERSON4, I don't feel like doing math @DATE2. I'm beat,"" I complained as we walked into @PERSON1's room for math right after lunch. ""@CAPS6 neither,"" she replied. ""I say we just sit there and make it look like we're doing work."" We made our way to the table in the back where @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 were already sitting. They had their books, pencils, and spirals out, but sat there with vacant expressions. @PERSON4 and I joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks. ""@CAPS8 uh, I was talking to @LOCATION1 @TIME1 and he said that we don't have to do any work @DATE2. We can just sit here and hang out,"" I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching on, @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 grinned. @PERSON3 turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack. She began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Midway through eating it, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big blob of it on the window behind @CAPS6. @PERSON4 noticed and immediately started to chuckle. ""@CAPS10, what's that?!"" she exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear. @PERSON1 and a few classmates glanced over briefly, but got back to the lesson instantly. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. ""@CAPS11 guys, I had @TIME1 crazy dream @TIME2,"" @PERSON3 said as the laughter died down. ""I went to @TIME1 @DATE1 camp thing, and @PERSON2 was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes. Oh, and he also had a clipboard!"" We stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about @TIME1, was that @PERSON2 often substituted for our teachers, and he wore that exact outfit each time. But the even funnier thing was that it really wasn't funny at all. We were @CAPS8 desperate for a good time, we found chocolate blobs on windows and khaki pants to be hilarious. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly, @CAPS3 leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately broke, dropping him right to the ground. To anyone else, @TIME1 would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, staring at one another. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt sympathy, but simply ironic that obsolete things sent us into fits of giggles, while a substantial, laughable event made us simply sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget the @ORGANIZATION2. Though it was a waste of time, we had many good laughs. We @MONTH1 not have learned a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other.",25.0,20.0,,45.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20767,8,"Many @CAPS1 to laughter People always say that laughing can have many benefits. The truth, I believe, is that laughter is not always the best thing. Laughing can have many different meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles,happiness, and memories. Although, there is one memory of laughter that does not prove that to be true. ""@CAPS2, I really don't wanna be here. I don't know that I can stay here and tell him this,"" I pleaded to @CAPS11 mother to @CAPS6 me go back home. ""@CAPS3 need to do this honey. @CAPS8's for the best."" @CAPS4 that point I had always though @CAPS11 mother knew best. Now, I wasn't so sure. I sat patiently, trying to hold back tears, waiting for @CAPS11 father to get back to his house. I knew he was at the bar, and silently thanked him that I had time to think.  I was supposed to go tell him how I felt about him always drinking alcohol. Every time I went over there I saw him either drunk, or on his way there. The truth is, I was scared. I was scared for his health and scared that I was the reason for his drinking. I was getting older and needed to tell him what I thought and how I felt. While distracted by this realization, he came storming through the door. I looked up at @CAPS11 drunk father and @CAPS11 heart dropped. I burst out in tears while @CAPS11 mother held me in her arms. ""@CAPS5...@CAPS8's alright,"" she soothed. @CAPS11 father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway. He wasn't the man @CAPS11 mother had once married anymore. He had became a monster.  I couldn't stand @CAPS8 anymore. I walked into the room where @CAPS11 mother waited with worry in her eyes. ""@CAPS6's go home,"" I said. On the way home I sobbed until @CAPS11 shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun shone down on @CAPS11 face as I awoke to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to @CAPS11 @CAPS9 how I've felt all along. We drove back to his house and when we pulled into the drive way, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. ""@CAPS7. Hey."" @CAPS8 made me upset that @CAPS11 father was acting as if nothing was wrong. I walked in, with confidence, and asked him to sit down. I was content with the fact that I had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk.  ""@CAPS9, we really need to talk. I feel as though @CAPS3 are making a huge mistake by drinking. I know @CAPS10 addicted and there are risks with stopping but @CAPS3're also endangering @CAPS10 health!"" I basically screamed at him. I poured out @CAPS11 heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done @CAPS11 father sat there with a blank look pasted on his face. He laughed. ""@CAPS10 mother told @CAPS3 to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about @CAPS8. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 doesn't know what she's talking about."" @CAPS11 jaw dropped as he acted as though this wasn't serious. Anger boiled in me.  ""@CAPS3 don't even know me! @CAPS3 don't even care about me!"" I screamed then stormed out. I went into the living room and looked straight at @CAPS11 mother and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave.  This time the car ride, again, seemed to be filled with silence. Thinking about how laughter is almost always a great thing, I started to cry because, just once, laughing didn't mean happiness. @CAPS8 meant tears.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

20768,8,"                          Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5, we've got something to tell @CAPS3."" I knew @CAPS9 they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew that @CAPS8 they went into the other room, @CAPS6 wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce @CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words ""We are getting a divorce,"" rang in my head like church bells @CAPS8 a couple is getting married. The happiest sound @CAPS3 could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of @CAPS9 was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet @CAPS11 become one, @CAPS6 had turned red @CAPS11 irritated. @CAPS6 killed me inside to see her crying, @CAPS11 while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love @CAPS11 that @CAPS6 all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment @CAPS11 anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy.  At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around @CAPS9 was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand @CAPS7 this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to of been off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would of used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents relationship.  Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say ,""@CAPS6's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father @CAPS11 I."" @CAPS7 did they think those statements made @CAPS6 better? Because @CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, @CAPS11 the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in @LOCATION1. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. @CAPS11 more importantly than my home, my heart. @CAPS6 was broken @CAPS11 I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together.  Just @CAPS8 @CAPS6 felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I @CAPS1 never forget. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. @CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time @CAPS8 mom @CAPS11 I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm @CAPS11 familiar. @CAPS11 especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives @CAPS11 mine.  I began to laugh, @CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure @CAPS9 to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked ,""@CAPS9's wrong, @CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That @CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, @CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @CAPS11 the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, @CAPS11 memories in our hearts, we would survive this.  From then on, i solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh."" The statement that said to me, @CAPS6's okay to be sad, but that as long as @CAPS3 have laughter in your life, everything @CAPS1 be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If @CAPS6 had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works @CAPS11 never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

Have you ever had those moments when everything seem too much? Then a friend says something that makes you laugh, once your done laughing you start to cry because it felt so good to laugh. Or when you laugh so hard you fall to the floor @CAPS1 can't get up for what seems hours? Yet looking back you forget what was so funny. Laughter is magical, @CAPS7 behind love. Those two seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone, not just you boyfriend/girlfriend but you friends @CAPS1 family too, you know how to make them laugh or cheer them up, how to have fun with them, @CAPS1 that brings you even closer together. When I'm with @CAPS16 friends the one thing we seem to do most is laugh. We laugh about anything @CAPS1 everything that is even slightly funny. It bring us closer together, sharing a moment of joy. The six of us are very close @CAPS1 will be friends after high @ORGANIZATION1 is over, even if we go to colleges a thousands of miles away. It is because we have shared so many happy memories. Laughter is important in a relationship. We trust each other @CAPS1 can share anything with them even our most important secrets. This story is how we came to be so close. Brightly colored fancy dresses @CAPS1 killer high heels were splayed out across the room. Open soda cans @CAPS1 chip bags. The faint smell of nail polish, flowery perfume, @CAPS1 deodorant lingering in the air. Laughter @CAPS1 giggles bubbling through out the room with the occasional squeal. Pitch black outside but light @CAPS1 warm in. Six of us lounging around the room. Smeared makeup @CAPS1 deflating hair. Sweat pants @CAPS1 baggy t-shirts. We all went from looking our very best to... not, within a few minutes. Yet not one of us cared. We when looking at each other we were able to @CAPS17 past appearances had fun with each other, not their looks. We had just gotten back from the @ORGANIZATION1. None of us had had dates but we still managed to have the time of our lives. ""@CAPS1 did you see him! He was dancing with her!"" ""I wouldn't really call that dancing...."" she made a pelvic thrust, we all burst into a new round of giggles @CAPS1 shouted stuff like, ""@CAPS2, get a room!"" We gossiped about what we saw, who was with who, pretty dresses, hot @CAPS4, creeper @CAPS4, slow dances, the music, even our @CAPS8 we hid our cups so we would know which one was ours when we wanted to use it again.We had all been friends, but recently we had been becoming closer. Starting to move from friends to best friends.  It was at least @NUM1 @CAPS3. Everyone was exhausted but was forcing themselves to stay up with caffeine @CAPS1 sugar. You @MONTH1 ask why, but I'm not really sure. Maybe because we always seem to have so much to talk about, because we enjoy each others company, or just because we can, so why not?""@CAPS4 I think we need a picture, a picture of the six of us."" I said.""@CAPS5!"" ""@CAPS6""""@CAPS7 now?

We all sat there clinging to each other in total shock.""@CAPS16 bed! You @CAPS4 are faaaaat..."" @PERSON1 said while trying to contain a giggle. Suddenly we were in hysterics. Even @PERSON1's mom was laughing. We were one big throbbing pile of laughter. Only the corner of the bed had broken so we were all pulled down into that corner. Then someone started tickling, it was war. Every girl for themselves. It was a mass of bedsheets, wiggling fingers, bare feet, biting @CAPS1 a whole lot of laughing. ""@CAPS17 the pictures have developed."" The first one showed us sitting together smiling, but the second one was taken just as the bed broke.

20770,8," Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be, and this made picking one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation amusing, as I am kind of weird that way. But then it hit me... one of the four topics was about laughter... why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage. The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one, nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly.  So now I had my topic. To make things even more amusing, as I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was. However, I began to worry that whoever is grading these things @MONTH1 not find this as amusing as I did, which would perhaps hurt my grade. But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic, and consequently amusing.  You @MONTH1 think that I am easily amused, but to that I must say: well, yeah, I kind of am. I can find almost anything amusing, but that, I find, is the beauty of laughter. It is so abstract, that each and every person experiences it in differently. Some people @MONTH1 find very simple things considerably amusing, but others @MONTH1 be not so easily amused. These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. As I said before, humans like to laugh, and we like to make other people laugh with us. And regardless of the way you @MONTH1 interpret laughter's abstract form, you've got to admit: it's kind of funny.",21.0,18.0,,39.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20771,8,"Someone once told me that laughter is the key element of comfort. I believe that @CAPS7 is one of the most important part of any relationship. @CAPS7's what brings people together. A perfect example; about two years ago in the middle of fall, I was crying about my dog passing away. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better but nothing was working. I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob @CAPS1, when @ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help @CAPS7. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh @CAPS7 off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-@CAPS2. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,"" then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend @PERSON1 suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, @CAPS4 was waiting on the steps for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 stood back a second then said, ""aw were you waiting for me little one."" @CAPS4 replied with, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny , last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur."" I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. @CAPS4 and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe @CAPS7's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions.",15.0,18.0,,33.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

We had one class together. Which was called @CAPS2. Passing each other in the hallway just would make my @DATE1. We met in a class that we both didn't care for. I would ask him for help even though I didn't need it just so I could talk to him. We also would see each other at the swimming pool because his brother swam and I did also. I would see him during the @DATE1 but not very often. Instead of him ""helping"" me we would sit and talk about our lives how they were at school and at home.  First semester is over and he got moved out of the class to another class period. We would still talk at the pool and see each during the school @DATE1. He would now give me hugs in the hallway. We started to become really close friends. Talking drew us even closer. Laughing was big part in our conversations. We found out that we have a lot in common. Like hunting, wheeling, foods, favorite dog and our personalities are so much alike, that it seems as if we grew up around each other. @MONTH1 came around one more month of school. I started to go to his house every once in awhile. He came to mine more often. In the beginning of @DATE4 strawberry festival came around and I asked him to go with me. He said okay and his parents also went but with my parents. That @DATE3 was fun and enjoyable. The end of @DATE4 was finally here, school was out in a @DATE1. Summer break was here. The @DATE1 @DATE1 of school was fun. It was going to be so nice not to have homework over the @DATE3 or during the week. All we did the @DATE1 of school was sign @CAPS1 books and tell funny stories about the school @CAPS1. After school I went to swim practice and after practice he was still at the pool waiting for his brother. We were outside talking and all the sudden out of know where he asked me ""will you go out with me""? I said... yes! He made me one of the happiest girls in the world that @DATE1. Today, in @DATE2 we are still dating. One and only relationship I have ever had. I hope we @DATE1. He tells me almost every @DATE1 that he is going to marry me.

20774,8,"When I was younger I liked to go fishing a lot. I always went with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1.We loved to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. We did a lot of fishing while we were camping. One day when we were fishing for @CAPS2 head and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @PERSON1 hooked one on his last cast. He yelled t me that he was going to catch this on so I jumped off the four-wheeler and ran over to him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @CAPS1. It was by far the biggest @CAPS2 head that we have ever seen.  While he was reeling it in he said that it was very strong and I could see that he was having trouble. After a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore. We all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now. Right as @PERSON1 told me to get the net he slipped and fell right in the river and he let go of the pole.At this time I thought we lost a fish and a pole but @PERSON1 was not thinking straight and he jumped in the water after the pole.   Once @PERSON2 and I saw him swimming and struggling we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and I was almost to it. Right as I got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster. While I was trying to get the pole I was not focused on where I was going and I got caught on a tree so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to get the pole.  The chase for the floating fishing pole had now gone on for over five minutes and all of us were very far down the river. Now @PERSON2 was very close to the pole and @PERSON1 and I were just catching up to him. Suddenly, @PERSON2 yelled that he got the pole so we all swam to the shore to reel in the fish. At this time we were very happy that we went in the ice cold river to after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry. After a few minutes @PERSON2 was still reeling in the huge fish. He said he did not know how he was going to get it to the shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @PERSON2 jerked the pole as hard as he could to get it onto the bank but as he pulled the line broke and the fish got away. All of our hard work was not for anything. After that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story think it is funny but personally i don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. One good thing is that this was the most memorable day of fishing I had ever had.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The writing is clear and focused.

20775,8," One time when i was spending the night at @ORGANIZATION1's she wanted to sleep oustide in a tent. @CAPS2 was @DATE1 and we always tryed seeing eachother anytime possible because she had to go back to boarding school alot. So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went ouside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and i was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. @CAPS2 was like two best friends dating two bestfriends, and we were closer then ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the @TIME1 so @CAPS2 was just @LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point i was just cracking up with laughfter, @ORGANIZATION1 started laughing even harder because she saw me laughing and pee'd her self while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot that she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after that happend, so all of this was going on at around one in the @TIME1 and i was surprised her mom didn't come out and yell at us for being loud. When i looked over and saw that she had pee'd her self i yelled out ""@CAPS1 my god, @CAPS3 pee'd your self @ORGANIZATION1!"" @CAPS2 was the most funniest thing, i dont think i have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said ""@CAPS3 should probably go take care of that,"" and then they got off the phone.

20776,8,"@ORGANIZATION1 is one of the many joys I love to share with people. I absolutely love to laugh, I don't know where i would be if I didn't laugh. My cousin; @CAPS1 and I, are usually together for most of the @DATE1 and the truth is we are not supposed to have energy drinks. @CAPS1's dad; @PERSON1, gave us a monster to split and that day we were going to @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1. After about ten minutes of us drinking the whole monster, me being the one who drank most of it, was the one who was staying calm. @CAPS1 on the other hand, who drank a couple of sips, was going crazy. She was running down the aisles and tripping over her own feet. She almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it. @ORGANIZATION1 hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her. Wendy; @PERSON1's wife and my second cousin started to get hungry, so we went to go eat pizza at the @ORGANIZATION2 cafe that is there. My mom had called me and I was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold on to my plate of hot pizza. I handed my plate to @CAPS1 because my plate was slipping from my grip. She was holding her food in her other hand, she felt the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it off to @PERSON1 who wasn't paying attention and he didn't have a good hold on it and my pizza dropped on the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us. After that embarrassing moment, @PERSON1 realized that he forgot the churos, so he told @CAPS1 to go get them. All three of us realized his mistake as soon as @CAPS1 left, cause @CAPS1 is a klutz and we probably jinxed it by saying @CAPS1 is probably going to drop them"". We were a little surprised that she hadn't dropped them yet, as soon as we thought that and she set them on the table, one of the churos fell off the table and rolled out of the package. We were @ORGANIZATION1 so hard that we couldn't breathe. @CAPS1 was so embarrassed by her mistake that she turned bright red. We felt bad for poor @CAPS1, but we couldn't help but laugh because of how funny it was. She knew it was funny but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things i usually say is if you can't and aren't willing to laugh at yourself then you aren't having fun. That's why i believe it is so important to laugh cause you gotta learn how to have fun when it is in a situation that you need to laugh at yourself but yet aren't wanting to. That's one of the biggest ways to have fun is by @ORGANIZATION1, because you know you made a small silly mistake that you think everyone in the world saw, all you need is to laugh it off. But you wont cause you feel too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a little mistake. Sometimes it's your job to go over to them, pat them on the back and tell them that everybody makes mistakes, you gotta learn how to be silly in a tough situation, and that nobody is perfect. Tell them to laugh it off, it helps and you will feel better once you realize that when life knocks you down just get back up cause that's what life is all about. That's the only way you can learn from your mistakes and from life as well. Laughter is really important the more you laugh the better you feel and the better you feel the more fun you will have. Laughter fixes everything, it is a bandage for the little things that happen in life.""",18.0,15.0,,33.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20777,8,"                 A @CAPS1 @CAPS2  I once heard ""laughter is the best medicine."" I believe that is true. I could laugh all day long, finding anything @CAPS9 everything funny in @CAPS3 world. Laughter is important to me, without it, life would be boring. Sometimes Laughter is good @CAPS9 comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @CAPS9 mean. I like to avoid the cruel @CAPS9 mean laughter, @CAPS9 just stick to the good laughter. When one of my friends is laughing @CAPS9 smiling, it makes me want to know @CAPS10 they're laughing about, so I can laugh too.  Birthdays are fun, laughing usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS2, I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special so I invited my closest friends, @CAPS9 my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @CAPS9 I are pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a good time, both of us acting crazy @CAPS9 always laughing. For my party my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, @CAPS9 soon the party was over, but, my cousins were not leaving until the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, my cousin came in @CAPS9 wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass. ""@CAPS3 is so good!"" my cousin @PERSON1 said. ""I know that's why I had my mom make it"" "" @CAPS4 you wanna hear a joke?"" ""@CAPS5."" @PERSON1 said. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS7 once was a kid named butt itches, he was really sick @CAPS9 one day died, his mom cried to the doctor,""@CAPS8 my poor butt itches!"" ""@CAPS9 @CAPS12, @CAPS4 you wanna know @CAPS10 the doctor said?"" ""@CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 @PERSON1. ""@CAPS12 itch it!"" @PERSON1 had just took a drink of punch when I said @CAPS3. She spit the punch out of her mouth while laughing, it got all over me. Usually when someone spits, or spills something on you, you get mad. I started cracking up laughing, @CAPS9 so did she. ""@CAPS8 my gosh! That's so gross."" ""@NUM1 @CAPS9 I could not stop laughing. The joke was not that funny, it was the punch all over me @CAPS9 the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before even realizing that both our moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just staring at us wondering @CAPS10 in the world had happened.  You would think that getting punch spitted at your face, on your @CAPS2, would make you mad. @CAPS3 is why laughter makes ordinary days special.

I was a @NUM1 grader who's weight had reached the point at witch my doctors were telling me ""@CAPS6 should look in to a weight loss program."" this news alone was crushing my self a steam and my class mates laughter soon brought me to tears. I can recall a particular @CAPS7, perhaps one of the worst. I was on the buss and almost home when @NUM4 girls who i thought were my friends started laughing. Little did I know it was me they were laughing at so I joined in what i thought, and what seamed to be some @CAPS8 giggling. Suddenly they stopped, looked at me started whispering to each other then one of the girls blurted @CAPS4 between chuckles ""@CAPS6 look like a beached wail!"". She said this so @CAPS5 the whole buss herd and immediately burst in to side spiting laughter. I walked down the same street i walked down every day were the buss dropped me off. That day it seamed more gloomy then ever before. This is the day I decided I was never going to set foot on the buss again! It is encounters with laughter like this that broke my heart but also gave me a strong motivation towards loosing weight and regaining confidence. Days, weeks, months, even years have passed scene that day in the @NUM1 grade. I'm @NUM6 pounds lighter, a varsity cheerleader and proved of who I am. The tables have turned for me in many ways. I am no longer the person who gets laughed at because of my weight, but some times i catch my self sometimes mindlessly cracking a joke or two at some one else expense. I can recall just the other day, I was with my best friend at the mall. She spotted this girl who was over weight and immediately started giggling and elbowing me in the side trying to draw my attention to her like she was some freak show. When I saw the girl my first reaction was a hideous @CAPS3 but just as soon as I did so i felt the same pain I felt when that buss full of my pears laughed at me. I immediately stopped, realizing the pain my laughter could have brought her. My self, I am a very funny person and will do just about any thing for a @CAPS3. But when it comes to laughing at people and hurting there feelings this is were i draw the line because i know how it feels to be in there position and i hope that my story helps open the eyes of u and others to the harmful effects some laughter can have. So go ahead and @CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and even @CAPS2 just not at the expense of another persons feelings.",20.0,18.0,36.0,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3,,,":**

20779,8," Laughter is a big part of my life and I believe @CAPS1 have to have laughter in a good and healthy relationship. This is a true story about laughter and it's affects on my life.Laughter is a good thing for your body, mind and soul, it lightens my mood when I'm feeling down. I'm glad to say I have lots of relationships, many of which are blessed with laughter. My mother and I have a good relationship together, and almost any time we're together in the same room there is bound to be laughter. My mother and I laugh all the time, over silly things. We laugh just to laugh and most of the time, we don't even know what we're laughing at. She can make me laugh at the most ridiculous things. I'm also pretty sure she's the only person who can get me to spit my drink all over the dash board just because of a silly face she made.  My mother isn't the only one I can have a good time with. I remember a conversation I had with a good friend of mine, it was about the way people laughed. I told her about how I had noticed that people usually laughed in different vowel sounds, like a, e and o. It seemed odd to me that I had only ever heard people laughing in those vowels and not I and u. She thought the same thing I did, so we came up with this idea to laugh in the vowels I and u. Of course people were too busy with their own lives to notice us laughing oddly, but it was fun all the same. @CAPS1 never really realize how hard it is to not laugh until the occasion is upon @CAPS1. My mom and I were at my aunts house trying desperately not too laugh. We had all decided to do a facial cleansing mask we had seen on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The mask itself was made out of whisked egg whites and toilet paper. @CAPS1 dip the toilet paper in the egg whites and plaster it all over your face. @CAPS1 have to wait at least fifteen minutes or until it's completely dry before @CAPS1 can take it off, other wise it doesn't work.   The three of us did as the instructions told us, but were dismayed when we saw the final results of our efforts. We weren't upset because we looked repulsive we were upset because we all looked like a bunch of crazy ladies, and we found it exceedingly difficult not to burst into laughter. The site of my mother and aunt was so ridiculously funny I had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so my face could dry. After about fifteen minutes I came back to find my mother and aunt in the bathroom drying each others face with a hair dryer. After seeing this I just couldn't stand it any longer, I started crying with laughter, my mask cracked and all my hard work went down the drain. that day was one of the funniest days of my life, we laughed together so hard our abdomens hurt. I love to laugh as I've said before and I personally have many different forms of laughter. when I laugh really hard I laugh all the air out of my lungs and forget to breathe. What it looks like to others I have no clue but I must be a red faced girl rocking back and forth. Other times I kind of have a manly ha ha but if your lucky @CAPS1'll get to hear me snort. The thing I'm trying to say is that laughter is a good thing and it has made a big difference in my life, I don't know what I would do without it. I love to laugh, I think I would die if I couldn't laugh.",20.0,17.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,":**

20781,8," The laughter in me.  To me all you need to do to get through a tough and horrible day is a good @CAPS5. It gives you hope throughout the day, and no matter what kind of mood your in, when leaving to work, going to school, or really any activity that involves a ""sigh"" moment. For me I get that feeling about school, but I can always count on my best friend, @PERSON1. Everyday she manages to say something totally off topic and we'd end up dying of laughter at the top of the stairs near the science labs were we eat lunch. As people walk by they give us weird looks, we don't care because we understand each other. To me @CAPS9 is my way of reliving stress.My @CAPS1 agrees with me her name is @CAPS2 I call her @ORGANIZATION1. We've been best friends since the second grade. She is my rock. She inspires me to do something with my life, something more than working at some fast food restaurant. I hang out a lot at her at her house and we share so many great and fun memories. Its really bad when we are around each other, its like one look at each other and boom!, I'm on the floor not breathing because I'm dying of laughter. I don't know what it is but, its like when we see each other its a rush off all the good times we've spent coming together all at once. Sometimes we @CAPS5 hysterically over nothing. I doesn't make sense but I guess that doesn't matter when your hanging with your best bud.  Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. Its shows me how fun a person can be and if the have a sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile and not some stuck up want to be perfect robot. All @PERSON1 and I talk about is boys and boy problems and it makes me @CAPS5 and giggle, but when we are in our fifth period class forestry and fire we are like caged monkeys in a zoo. It's like we are magically ""high,"" all of a sudden have this out burst of energy. We sit next to sit side by side to one another and we tickle each other and @CAPS5 really loud. By the end of class I make a paper ball and we play paper soccer ball its fun especially when the teacher gives you dirty looks and tells you to stop and you don't do it. Lets just say that her face turns a very bright red color.Nothing compares to how much I @CAPS5 when I'm with @ORGANIZATION1. When I used to go to @CAPS3 I had three classes with her @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4. We also had lunch together, but anyway as I was saying, I swear we had a not stop @CAPS9 war everyday. My @CAPS5 is more like a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like, some thinks its cute, others think I @CAPS5 funny( The weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION2 she'd stand next to me and she'd look at me weird, or said something that didn't come out right, or sang obnoxiously, anything she did cracked me up it was so distracted when she was around but so much fun. I swear I got all of my exercise from @CAPS9 with her. At home when my family is all together, are way of laughter is mostly picking on one another. It's different than laughter with your friends. We make fun of how my sister @CAPS6 was supposed to be a boy because everybody thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mothers stomach. We made fun of my brother for being the only boy out of five kids. We make fun of my sister @PERSON2 for being the shortest one in our family. I can feel the difference between laughter. It's mostly criticism really.I @CAPS5 mostly because I feel more alive it gives me something to live for everyday in stead of ""@CAPS7 great, another day to try to get through, @CAPS8...no."" @CAPS9 for me gets me motivated for the day it's like my drug to get through life. It gives me an easy way in to communicate with others. I thank @CAPS10 for giving us the ability to @CAPS5 because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends. ""That's how I make friends I @CAPS5.""  ",15.0,20.0,40.0,40.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,,,":**

As I stared at the majestic destruction of the warm, humid air, I felt someone or something watching me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as I walked from one side of the house to the other. Finally, I reached the trailer just to be told by @PERSON4, my best friends mom, the she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents we headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. It would be about two hours of driving, that felt like twenty minutes. @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and I were the worst group of people to put into one car. We all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun. Once we arrived at our destination, we sprung out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I race @PERSON2 to the @ORGANIZATION1. the second we were done unpacking our belongings. The first few days were spent basking in the one hundred degree heat, swimming, and flirting with the random girls we found around the camp site. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and just pure fun we were having. During day two, we decided to go mountain biking. We were on those bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was going down. In the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created. There were burst of orange and red. The colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of riding our bikes in the heat, we chose to go for a swim. As we swam I felt something touching my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was only a stick. As I looked closer, it turned out to be a root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, as if someone or something had put it there. This though sparked a conversation about @CAPS2 for the day to come.  The sparks danced together as if they were @CAPS4 and the @LOCATION1. The only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire. @PERSON3 was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the flawlessness of nature, I felt someone watching me from behind. I nudged @PERSON3 and when we turned around, our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, almost twenty feet in the air. I spoke the word everyone was dreading, @CAPS2. I had slowly stood up and the light started spinning faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, that was next to me, and approached the light. As I grew closer, I could make out small figured in the @CAPS1 shadows. Then, an eruption of children laughing came booming from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control is laughter, and ran away. After returning to my seat next to the camp fire, I thought about life. What if @CAPS2 were real and they are watching us. No, there not real. I laughed it off, and continued my week long vacation.",18.0,15.0,,33.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,12,,": The essay has a clear main idea and supporting details, but the details are somewhat general and predictable.

20784,8," What makes you laugh? Laughter is a really good stress reliever. There are many different types of laughs around the world, some people's laughs are really high pitched and others @MONTH1 be very deep and low. Some other people snort and make other animal noises. I know that for me I have many different types of laughs for all the different emotions I feel. When I am upset I have a very distinctive laugh. Although when I am upset I laugh to make myself feel better and have a better day.   One time during a basketball game, I was having a really off night. Fouls were being called on me left and right. Normally when this happens to me, I get really mad and I lose my head and end up being taken out of the game and sitting on the bench. I absolutely hate sitting on the bench. This time when I got a foul called on me after already being threatened to be ejected from the previous game for the same reason. I decided to just smile and laugh about the foul and told myself to shake it off. My coach was very pleased with my change in attitude and just told me to play defense with my feet and to shake the bad call off and keep my head. When you are mad a person can take a lot away from the demonstrative looks you can make, although if you just smile and laugh about it, their reactions will be a lot different. I am not the only one on my basketball team who feels this way. A lot of us just laugh about calls that are made and just shake them off.  I am also a cheerleader. When you are a cheerleader you should always try to have a smile on your face at all times, and make it seem like you are in a happy mood. I play in a basketball game every night before I go out and cheer. I have to do my best to keep my cool while playing so that I'm in a good mood for after my game when I do cheer. Laughing helps me a lot with keeping my cool and relaxing while I am playing, so I'm in a good mood for cheer.  My coach is also very huge on people having positive attitudes. She tells us at practice that if we just smile and laugh about things that go wrong the outcome will be a lot better then if we have bad attitudes about it. I took this in very strongly and it stayed with me. My coach inflenced me to have a better attitude and since that day I have tried to have a positive attitude. I keep my positive attitude by just smiling and laughing when things in my life go wrong.  A laugh can go a really long way. I personally think laughing helps express the mood you are in. Laughing is also good for the body. Laughing can make you feel one hundred times better when you are feeling down in the dumps. I try my hardest to be in a good mood at all times. I really don't like being in a bad mood, it's really not fun. Laughing makes me feel a lot better.  I think that laughing is a very good function for the body. I feel that when I laugh it makes my mood better and the moods of the people around me a lot better. Laughing is a magical feeling that goes through out your body and makes you feel warm inside. I think everyone should laugh at least once a day. It will make your day that much better.",17.0,20.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20785,8," Laughter is the so called ""best medicine"". I do not believe that to be true, however my nephew @MONTH1 have other thoughts. My nephew was ""sick"" for every school day for two weeks. ""@CAPS1 just doesn't like school"", I would tell his grandma. The thought of school being no fun and not liking it changed drastically for my nephew.  We let him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was party day for them. Every two weeks if they work hard they get a party, lucky for @CAPS2 they have been working diligently. The stubborn side of my nephew was showing it's ugly face that morning as @CAPS1 fought every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door @PERSON1 did something uncharacteristic, to him and five year old's all over the @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 stood as still and silent as a marble statue. It couldn't have been better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags, they went all out for the first one of the year. The aroma made my stomach gurgle with desire. Above all they had desserts, cakes, cookies, pie, all of this cooked thirty feet from you. so you walk through that door and you mouth instantly fills with warm saliva. These children played with a ninja like ability, one moment in front of you, you blink, and just as fast as you blinked they disappeared. It took me an hour at least to find @PERSON1 in that small room. As I realized though it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt hit the cold, hard, and nearly unbearable surface @PERSON1 was in front of me. @CAPS1 had this ear to ear grin on his face that scared me, @CAPS1 never had that big of a grin on his face unless @CAPS1 had a plan. @CAPS1 definitely had a plan, in seconds my face was soaked.  @CAPS1 had been concealing a squirt gun behind his back, and had the escape route planned out. With the chairs and the short tables how they sat long legs and weaving through them did not go well together. It was extremely difficult to catch up in the room, but once we hit the hallway and I could extend my legs it was an easy run. His ear to ear grin disappeared once I caught him, but the laughter on both sides did not. @CAPS1 @MONTH1 have got my face but I got his head! My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still party hard, but thanks to us no more squirt guns. I think if we would have waited any longer it would have taken some more work to get him to like school. @PERSON1 is a very smart, athletic and good child. @CAPS1 will be just fine in school, plus @CAPS1 is strong so I pity the child who fights him.",22.0,20.0,,42.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

20787,8," I know you guys listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that alot of people don't really answer the prompt that you give them. Well I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different and even make us @CAPS3 at them. Also why laughter is so special to me.  I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS3 with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend.  I think that everybody's @CAPS3 is unique in it's own way. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us!  Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS3. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 and be happy everyday. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other.  My life is all about laughter and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun then having a girls night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life.

20790,8," Laughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships. I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you've just met and growing closer to people you care about. In my opinion @CAPS2 brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down. Getting enough bravery to gain new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her, is where laughter played an important role. @CAPS2 was the @DATE1 I was fifteen and a sophomore at @ORGANIZATION1 school. @CAPS2 was my first year there. I have been to many schools, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wood, etc. and like any new school I was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers. Everyday I woke up, got ready, went to school, got home did homework (maybe), and went to bed . @CAPS2 was a boring cycle that I seemed to be trapped in. The image of being cool and trying to fit in did not seem to work so much. Because one thing I realized was that trying to be cool and something you're not only gets you so far. The one thing that kids, people in general, like is when you're real and being yourself . I found that out later on, but I actually didn't realize that's what people liked the most. I said to myself one time that I didn't like trying to act like someone or something because the truth was I actually thought that I was a cool person deep down. So I changed my ways I stopped trying to act cool, and acted like myself. And @CAPS2 turned out that I actually was cool and that girls actually found me attractive, and not only attractive but a funny person that was likable. My main attribute, well besides my looks was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. @CAPS2 gained me many friends that I didn't have in the beginning. @CAPS2 even gained me one of the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her name was @LOCATION2, in my eyes there was no girl that could compare to her in any way. She had the body of a coca cola bottle, caramel skin, and the face of a goddess ( and I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl she had many followers and admirers who were similar to me. So what chance did I have? What did I, @PERSON1 have to offer her? Laughter. My greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times. Even though @CAPS2 didn't last as long as I would have liked @CAPS2( forever) @CAPS2 was great being with her for as long as I did, the things we got to do and the many experiences we had together, are priceless. And @CAPS2 was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face. I believe that without laughter this world would not be the place that @CAPS2 is today. Sure, there is still crime and many horrors and atrocity's committed today, but imagine how horrid @CAPS2 would be without laughter. Joy, which I believe is the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. @CAPS2 allows us to turn our heads and overlook things. Without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

It was my sister, right away she could feel my pain and noticed my tears. I could see in her face, the love and care. She asked me whats wrong. I could hear the worry in her voice. My river of tears stopped and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed through my mouth. @CAPS1 need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said,""@CAPS1 matter whatever happens, I'll always love you."" @CAPS2 we laughed.

20793,8," The night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure. Shadows slithered across the street by the lamp light of passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that should not have been stated. Resulting in her calling me as soon as I sat down on my bed. The words we exchanged left smoldering wreckage in our wake. Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones. Once I laid back down in my bed, and my anger diminished, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt.  I said things that were unnecessary and horrible. As I laid on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowing being squeezed by some unseen force. It labored my breathing and soon tears began to fall from my eyes. The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house, and stealing whatever valuables I had left. My day had ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang once more. Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller I.D. I turned out to be my best friend, and so I answered not knowing what @CAPS1 wanted. @CAPS1 asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch. When @CAPS1 pulled into my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I climbed into the passenger's seat and immediately @CAPS1 knew something was wrong. @CAPS1 asked me if something had happened and I replied with a one worded answer, ""@PERSON1.""  @CAPS1 knew that it was not the right time to talk about it, and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee. @CAPS1 did the same but with much less force. Then @CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head. I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession. Bringing a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists unclenched. We sat there in silence for a short time while @CAPS1 chose his words carefully. Then @CAPS1 decided to change the subject for the time being because @CAPS1 saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS1 asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth. We became silent again and then @CAPS1 asked me, ""@CAPS2 you feel better now that you got it all out?"" I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected. After thinking about it I replied yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, payed, and left. My mood had been lifted, but I was still upset. So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car. @CAPS1 and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water. @CAPS1 then asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The joke @CAPS1 told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard I had trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar. I have always turned to my friends when I felt down. And there have always been there proving I can count on them.  That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be far better then I had hoped. It is not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood, but it is also important that they make me laugh. Because if your counting on someone to brighten your day, what better way to @CAPS2 it ten make them laugh. Laughter has always held important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mostly because I find the most idiotic things hilarious. I know that laughter will never disappear. I hope that one day when I am old and decrepit, all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I enjoyed a few good laughs with my friends. Because laughter is magical. It can make a sad man glad, make sunshine on a cloudy day, and make light of the darkest situations.",20.0,22.0,,42.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,1,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20794,8,"  Being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend. Everyone has their flaws; a friend can always look past them and find the good in the one that they trust. A friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry. Making someone laugh can always help when they think that it's not possible for their life to get any worse. Laughter is the most valued gift that can be given. You know inside that it's making them happy just from seeing the smile on their face. There have been many times in my life where I have laughed so hard that I cried. There is truly no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life that can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous that it just breaks you into a hysterical laughter. I laugh a lot throughout the day. When I don't, people get suspicious and they feel like there's something wrong with me. That's literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life. Laughing is my second language in life. There has been one time in particular in my life span so far that has made me laugh so hard that I cried tremendously hard. My friends were staying the @TIME1 at my house and we were just being boys. We did so many things that mad us question our sanity: we at hot sauce by the spoon full, we watched comedy shows, and we also ate ourselves sick. It was the time of a lifetime and we laughed through it all. While watching the comedy shows, we couldn't breath. We were laughing so hard! Nothing could make me stop laughing; I would just keep replaying every joke in my head and I'd start laughing even more. I already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier. The comedian was a magician with words; the way he put them all together to just seemed like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times. I laughed and cried over and over again. I probably did that for ten minutes straight! It was unbelievable. Making these life-long memories with my friends is something that I will never forget. I truly know how great I have it in my life; people would kill to be in my shoes and to get the love and support I get from my friends and family. All my experiences are the things I learn from, whether they're good or bad, I know that its all going to help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when it is presented to me. All the laughs i share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me. They made a point in my day great as well. Being myself around them is great as well because I know that they're already accepted me into their lives and I don't have to try to be anyone else.  Everyone laughs at some point or another throughout their lives no matter how much they deny it. I really don't even know why they would because what better feeling is there than being able to let out a little giggle every once in a while? I really don't think that there is any. I feel really honored that I have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life. It shouldn't be any other way in my personal opinion. Live life to the fullest; why would you want to live it any other way?",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20795,8," Its always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friends @PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear all I could hear was a loud crying. @PERSON1 wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, @PERSON1 wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to get really worry. Couple minutes later, @PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happen. @PERSON1 started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, @PERSON1 screamed that while she was home watching the @CAPS1 basketball team play basketball, her dog @CAPS2 got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @PERSON1 would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going threw my mind at that time. Even thought that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of what the words I needed to say to @PERSON1 but I was confuse. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confuse, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told @PERSON1 that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought @PERSON1 was mad. All of the sudden I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relief that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @PERSON1 wouldn't shut her mouth she just laughed and laughed and laugh hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. @PERSON1 thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worst. As I was laughing I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to be call. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. @PERSON1 laughed with me and thank me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and cant really describe. After making my friend @PERSON1 laugh I found out laughter was a key element of life.

20796,8," Laughter is an important element to have in life. Because without @CAPS3 there would be no happiness or joy in the world. @CAPS1 are a great source for laughter, @CAPS1 are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter for to release pain. For example, whenever @CAPS10 dad gets hurt he starts laughing. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but @CAPS3 did hurt him. so @CAPS10 @CAPS2 sat down and started to laugh. I guess this so-called trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time.  When I learned about how laughter heals, @CAPS3 wasn't too long ago. @CAPS3 was last @DATE3, @CAPS3 was early @DATE5 and @CAPS5 of @DATE5 was coming close. Traditionally me and @CAPS10 parents would drive to @ORGANIZATION1. And use the money we have been saving up all year round and buy a huge pack of fireworks.  Once @CAPS5 of @DATE5 came I was filled with joy, I woke up and immediately run up to @CAPS10 mom and ask ""@CAPS3's @CAPS5 of @DATE5 can I take the fireworks out to the package now?"" I was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy. @CAPS7 shook her head ""@CAPS6 yet @PERSON1, its only eleven in the morning. Sunset doesn't come around till seven or eight"" @CAPS7 smiled at me. ""@CAPS8 girl."" @CAPS7 whispered as @CAPS7 left the room.  Once the huge golden sun finally went down and the smaller bright shimmering stars appeared. We all knew @CAPS3 was time. ""@CAPS9 you like to do the honors?"" @CAPS10 dad handed me the first firework and a lighter. A big smile appeared onto @CAPS10 face without @CAPS10 control. I loved fireworks, I love bright colors watching them as they spewed into the newly lit sky, filling @CAPS3 with a sea of colorful sparks. After @CAPS5 of @DATE5 had ended @CAPS10 cousin @CAPS12 came over. @CAPS10 mom had was little sick but @CAPS3 wasn't something that was contagious. @CAPS10 @CAPS25 figured that we were old enough to take care for ourselves and for @CAPS10 mom. And @DATE3 was ending and I wanted to see the movie @CAPS13 with @CAPS10 mom and @CAPS12 so badly.  @CAPS10 mom had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. but @CAPS3 seemed like @CAPS7 got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems.  Its mid @DATE5, @DATE4, and still no sign of @CAPS10 mom getting any better. @CAPS12 and I took walks with the dogs to the near by park, we went swimming, watched @CAPS15, clean the cars, We would try to find anything to do really.  @DATE1 came, and @CAPS10 mom was showing signs of improvement @CAPS7 was walking more naturally . I called @CAPS10 dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait one more day. I was worried about waiting another day because @CAPS12 was going home the next day. The next day, I woken up by the soft whisper of @CAPS10 moms voice. ""@LOCATION1, @PERSON1 honey wake up"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder. I opened @CAPS10 eyes slowly, opening them wider as @CAPS10 eyes focused of what was around me. ""@CAPS18 go to the movies?"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder once again. ""@CAPS19, but your sick."" I exhaled a heavy sigh. ""I am feeling a lot better today."" @CAPS7 smiled. ""@CAPS21 because the next showing is in twenty minutes."" The sudden rush to @CAPS21, woke me up. I then woke @CAPS12 up and we soon then left. The movie was good. Afterward, @CAPS12 went home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun went away, the whole house stood still.  @DATE2. this day is usually a time to kick back. I was on @CAPS10 computer most of the day, @CAPS10 dad was playing his video game. and @CAPS10 mom was in the kitchen preparing dinner. @CAPS10 dad went in to help her with dinner. until @CAPS7 almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands. @CAPS10 dad suggested that @CAPS7 go and take a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening @CAPS10 dad had found @CAPS10 mother. laying stiff, cold...@CAPS10 mother had passed away in her sleep that day. I felt as if @CAPS10 heart had exploded like a firework. A few days have passed I stood still on the couch. I found comfort in texting @CAPS12. Told her what the doctors told us. @CAPS12 mentioned how torn @CAPS10 @CAPS25 was about @CAPS10 mom. And even though @CAPS12 was hurting inside, her and her @CAPS2 @PERSON2 tried to get @CAPS10 @CAPS25 and everyone to laugh. Because they knew that laughter would make some of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing for finding a bit of laughter in a dark place. That is why laughter is a important element of out lives.

20797,8," Someone once said,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1, to me that means, that since everyone laughs, laughter is the quickest or easiest way to connect with another person. I believe this because at one point in time my older brother and I did not get along very well. We were almost never around each other, and when we were,we would either be fighting or ignoring one another. It wasn't much of a problem since he is five years older; but once I became older my brother and I began to see one another more often. So we then decided to sit down one day and talk. We weren't exactly sure what to say; so for the first ten minutes we just sat there in silence. Just two guys on the back porch in the middle of the @TIME1. Then out of no were he fell over backwards into a bush. We both laughed harder than we have ever laughed in our lives. So @CAPS1, when my family get together, there isn't a lot of arguing or fighting and we all sit and tell stories and laugh.For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important components of a relationship because, with laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love; and love is the most important component of life. So I say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between all people.""",15.0,18.0,,33.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

On @DATE1, after a long day at school @PERSON1 decided to log on @CAPS1-book to chat with some new friends she had made online. @PERSON1 had forgotten that she had sent a friend's request to @PERSON2. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 had accepted @PERSON1's request that's when @PERSON1 remembered about the request. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 stared to know more and more about each other minute after minute, @CAPS9 before the had no clue who the other one was. @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number after along chat, @CAPS12 she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of @CAPS1-book. @PERSON2 was starting to like @PERSON1 and @CAPS12 was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 now knew that @PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is @NUM1 and also have friends in common. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked talking to @PERSON2 a lot. @CAPS12 did @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh a lot. I mean ""a lot"", @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked that because it always made her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Any how, @PERSON2 didn't mind, he @CAPS4 liked @PERSON1. He had a @CAPS4 big hope that he could have a chance at making @PERSON1 happy. @CAPS12... he @CAPS5 @PERSON1 if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said... ""@CAPS3 I would very much like to be your girlfriend"".  ""@CAPS4 you would?"" @CAPS5 @PERSON2.  ""@CAPS3 why wouldn't I? replied @PERSON1. ""@CAPS6 I thought that you wouldn't @CAPS9 you recently got out of a relationship"" @PERSON2 answered. Days had past they were doing perfectly until... @PERSON1 starting to receive texts from her ex-boyfriend. This started to affect @PERSON1's relationship with @PERSON2.But the bad thing was that @PERSON1 was still in love with @PERSON3. @PERSON2 knew that for one. But that didn't stop @PERSON2 from fighting to get @LOCATION1's @CAPS7. @PERSON1 is the type of girl that doesn't like hiding anything from her boyfriend. @CAPS12 one night while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 were talking on the phone, @PERSON2 decided to ask @PERSON1 if she was willing to try to forget her ex. @PERSON1 was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said... ""@CAPS8 @PERSON2 I'll try but I'm not promising anything.""@CAPS9 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 have a @CAPS4 good communication when laughing is involved, @PERSON1 changed the subject and @CAPS5 @PERSON2 if he was willing on doing her a favor. Of course @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3"". The favor that @PERSON1 had @CAPS5 @PERSON2 for was if he could laugh for her. ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON2 laughed. ""@CAPS12 can you do me that favor? @PERSON1 @CAPS5. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS11! @PERSON2 laughed again. Who would of thought that laughter in a relationship could make it @CAPS12 much better. @CAPS3 it wouldn't make it perfect or exactly how you want it to be but it's sure much better than fighting @NUM2 for things that are just plain dumb and pointless. I believe that laughter plays a excellent part in any kind of relationship. It's as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with one an other. @CAPS6 I hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays an important part in all relationships.

20802,8,"My relationship with laughter.  Well the first time I came face to face with laughter was when I met my boyfriend for the first time. Before I met him I was depressed all the time and my friends couldn't stand it anymore. But when my friends introduced me to him I fell in love for the first time I was happy for once not depressed and all alone in a corner crying all the time. When that happened for the first time in almost a year I smiled I didn't smile until the day I met him. That's when my friends knew that i found someone to take care of me and love me for who I am.  Later in the relationship is where laughter came into play I was laughing all the time when I was around him and not upset all the time. That's when we started hanging out but, it took all of our friends to us to hang out. After we stated to hang out we got to know each other better then we did for the beginning when we first met. It took until freshmen year for us to start dating. That is when I found out I suppose ably dating someone else and not him I didn't believe it at first until that guy came up to me and started yelling.   He came up to me and comforted me in front of my friends and said ""@CAPS1 are @CAPS3 cheating on me and it's over?"" with a guy @CAPS3 just met. Then he tried telling me it was over and I told him ""We were never dating in the first place!"". My friends walked up to me and saw me in tears and asked me whats wrong and tried to find me someone new. By the time @CAPS4 did I was with another guy and I'm happy with him and nothing can change that he will always be there for me and no matter what happens between us. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me and he makes me laugh when I'm upset or mad he says ""don't worry everything will be okay I promise so just believe in me.""  Laughter has been in this relationship for almost a year now so we don't plan to change that unless one of us messes up again we have messed up so many time that we don't know what to do anymore. If it leaves now I don't know what I'm going to do it's apart of my life and the relationship now lets see if we can keep it together with out messing up this time around. This part of my relationship is the best and it wont change at least I hope that it wont because it would make me go back to living in fear of my step dad I'm glade that I found someone. I hope that it doesn't change because laughter is what comes with him and when I'm around him he makes me laugh and no one has ever been able to make me laugh when I was crying not even my friends and family. Now that laughter is here almost all the time I can't wait until the day that sorrow goes out the window. So now that me and him are together and happy and hopefully nothing goes bad between us because of how much we love each other and I'm not my bubbly self when he's not around. Six to @CAPS2 of my friends say "" @CAPS3 are losing your bubbly self don't let her disappear on @CAPS3 she is there to guide @CAPS3 down the road."" @CAPS4 also told my dad that I don't really hang out with them anymore and the reason @CAPS1 I don't is because @CAPS4 can be bossy and @CAPS4 tell me what I can and can't do. @CAPS1 can't people just understand that this relationship isn't going to work if @CAPS4 keep getting in the middle of it @CAPS4 all think that my life revolves around them and it doesn't. My relationship with laughter has nothing to do with my friends and family it has to do with my boyfriend and me and that's @CAPS1 I told @CAPS3 about my relationship with laughter. Lets just say my relationship with laughter will always be here and nothing will change it not even my parents or his parents we can promise @CAPS3 that much. @CAPS1 can't this relationship just have a happy ending to it with out anyone or anything trying to get in the middle of it? I just wish that there was a world @CAPS3 could just run away to with out anyone knowing where it's at in the world. Well just to say nothing can make this relationship ever go bad unless we start to fight again with each other I hope that nothing will tear us apart and if it does who knows what will happen.",15.0,15.0,,30.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

20803,8,"                             ""Laughter"" I once heard a man say "" laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy"" @CAPS1 do people love to laugh? Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing @MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life.",20.0,17.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,2,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

20805,8," Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you have and couldn't remember. Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend @PERSON3 and I became friends. I'm also going to tell you how we have stayed friends for as long as we have and all the little things that have kept us friends. Admittedly we did not start off as friends who laughed all the time, instead we started off as a crier and a helper.  @PERSON3 and I first met in the eighth grade. I had just gotten called out of my first period class and greeted by my math teacher @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told me that we had just gotten a new student that moved here from @LOCATION1 and wasn't exactly happy about it. She also asked me if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @PERSON4, I agreed and walked into the room @PERSON3 was in. When I saw her the first thing I noticed was her eyes, as the tears went down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, like @PERSON1 said wasn't happy. I will admit i was a little scared to try and show her around seeing as she wasn't happy at all to be here. But once we got started she had calmed down immensely, but she still wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble tempts to make jokes. I still felt like she should be happy and broke out the big guns. So I walked differently and talked in a funny voice, I even started saying random funny things in long pauses. Eventually she smiled, so I kept going. Toward the end I got her and @PERSON4 to laugh so hard we all almost wet ourselves. But as funny as it was for us, it definitely wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen and no matter what, you always remember it when you see that person it happened with, right? Well to say the least @PERSON3 and I have a lot of those moments. Granted a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it fun. Like this one time in our drawing and painting class we, @PERSON3, @LOCATION2, and @CAPS1 and I, were all in @PERSON2's little office getting a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day and so had @CAPS3 else. I randomly look around the room and see a really cute looking poster I hadn't noticed ever before and without realizing it I had said aloud, ""@CAPS2, that's really cute."" @CAPS3 started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground. I still hadn't realized I said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining. They finally calmed down long enough to say what I'd just said and I blushed but started laughing along. Now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the bad times. It also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends.  But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends helps us later. If we didn't do all the little funny things and only did either big funny things, or boring things, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we're talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk. Or maybe when I laugh and I hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle. Possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together it's how we are and who we become with that other person, I feel like I become a better person and I believe I help her become one too. Besides the little things are just as funny as the big things we do.  So as I've stated before laughter is a big part of a friendship. @PERSON3 and my friendship hadn't started in of laughter, it started in tears and grew to be laughter. Laughter had brought us together in an act of weirdness and it has stayed very strong ever since, not only because we had a lot in common, to be frank we don't really even have that much in common, it is because of the big hilarious moments we've shared not only together, but with other people and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find really funny. I do have to say laughter is probably the best thing to keep any relationship good and healthy.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20806,8," There are a couple things that can lead strangers to being comfortable with each other, in my experience it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriends parents was very nerve wrecking and uncomfortable. I am a people person and I can get along with anybody. Starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a little bit of a challenge.  My boyfriend @PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people that like spending time with our families. So because of this it was obvious that meeting the family would come into play. I met his parents when we were young and we attended the last years of elementary and some of middle school and all but one year of high school together, I left for a couple years and came back really different. So after @NUM1 months of dating I met the folks.  One day in @DATE1 @PERSON3 had a football game that i attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys on the team. After a terrible loss @PERSON3 came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have a problem with it, but the fact that I wanted his parents to love me put a lot of weight on me.  I slowly walked over after him, and said ""@CAPS3"" in my most friendly voice possible. His mother reached out and said "" @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I'm @CAPS2"" I took her hand and shook it and replied ""@CAPS3, so nice to meet you"". I looked at @ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance then his father reached out with a very welcoming smile and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "" @CAPS4 there, I'm @PERSON2"", I shook his hand and felt less nervous and a bit comfortable. "" @CAPS1 , great to meet you, what did you think of the game?'. He looked surprise that i talked and we started a great conversation about football.  After talking about football for about @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes @PERSON3 brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes so I was nervous about telling it to his parents. It wasn't even a funny joke, @PERSON3 thought it was lame, yet i loved it. I took the chance anyways. I said "" @CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke"", @PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes that said oh god, don't. I looked away and started ""so there were two muffins in the oven one said, wow its hot in here, there the other screamed, holy crap! A talking muffin. I started laughing and my laugh is very odd. Anyone i meet tells me me laugh is so unique. His mother was like ""that is adorable i will have to tell it to @CAPS6"", I smiled gratefully. His father @PERSON2 said so sweetly "" I like your laugh, i ain't heard anything like it"". @PERSON3 came in and said ""yes her laugh is really something"". We all kinda smiled and at each other and went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing then laughing at my laugh. Thank goodness for laughing, once we started laughing I felt comfortable and welcomed. Until this day we laugh at me telling that joke. I still until this day am happy i told the joke.",17.0,18.0,,35.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20807,8,"   On @DATE1, I had a mission trip meeting in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 o'clock in the @TIME1. @CAPS11 friend @PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I had @CAPS11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to @LOCATION2. When we got to the church I went to @CAPS11 meeting till @NUM2 o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then.    Come to realize @CAPS11 grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and @CAPS11 mom, grandma and @CAPS11 sister @CAPS3 had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to @PERSON1 craft store. When we got there me and @PERSON2 went over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while @CAPS11 mom, grandma, and @CAPS3 stayed in @LOCATION3. I bought me and @CAPS11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into @PERSON1 to brag about the slippers to @CAPS11 mom and grandma.   That was a bad idea, @CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to @CAPS6, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to @CAPS6 @PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home.   We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out ""were going to @LOCATION5's, I want a bowl of chili"". Our reaction was ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11 gosh"". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says ""I need to go into @ORGANIZATION1"", @CAPS10 boy was that a mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION1 forever in a day.   After we got back in the car from @ORGANIZATION1 I sat in the backseat in the middle of @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 not to forget to show @CAPS11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was ""@CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home"". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by @PERSON2 and @CAPS11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all @CAPS11 breath, and @CAPS11 face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4 road.

20808,8," Laughing makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child. I think laughing is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my realationship with my sister @LOCATION1, we laugh all day, everyday. And I think thats why we have most fun together. I laugh most when I'm with my homies. I remember one time I was with @PERSON2 and we were just laughing so hard over nothing, thats something we do alot. I'm just a laughing person. Everybody knows that. I think when I laugh it just takes everything thats bad right now, and none of that even matters. I have this one friend namd @PERSON3, and he was the kind of person that made me laugh no matter what kind of mood I was in. So because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. One time me and @PERSON2 were with this girl that was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and I just straight up told her that she needs to talk, or laugh! or something. Then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things. See, if your with a bunch of friends, or people that your affiliated with it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh about the things you think are funny even if other people dont kaugh about it. Who cares. Be you. I love, absoulutly love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me it means that baby is gonna be a happy human. In movies and tv shows, sometimes I laugh. I just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just looking at the negative things. Just be happy, and laugh every once and a while.  One time me and my sister @PERSON2 stole a truck, well.. We asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yeah, but we really didnt use it for anything.. We just wanted to drive. And, when we started driving, we were going so fast, and blasting loud music. It was hilarious, and now everytime we listen to that song we were blasting, we just crack up laughing. So, when you make good memories and later in life think about the memories, or they get brought up somehow.. It's funny to just sit there and reminise. I could tell you a thousand stories. Heres one. One time, me and @PERSON2 were living with our good friend @PERSON1, and we were under his table pretending we were in a space ship, it was so, so, so, much fun! I'll never forget that time. And even when I'm writing this I still laugh about these stories. One time me and my sister @PERSON2 were skating downtown, and I was trying to do this one trick, I think it was a tre' flip? Anyways, I tryed to do it and I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was hilarious. And now everytime we pass that place where i fell, we just laugh about it. Memories are fun, every memory that I have, I laugh when remebered. One time me and @PERSON2 were hanging out with some cool people, and then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and just danced for like a hour, we have a video of it. That was really funny. In the video I'm mostly just laughing. ",15.0,16.0,,31.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20809,8,"@CAPS1.., that is a sound i love to hear, laughter. Laughter plays a big roll in my life. To me it is the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it is even better then ice cream, and that is saying a lot. I have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of. Like @CAPS6 my brother got sent back to jail. @CAPS6 I was @CAPS5 I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS6 i got dumped like last nights garbage, laughter made me feel as if nothing had ever happened. So @CAPS6 people are not feeling the best or are going through struggles in their life, I truly believe that laughter will make everything feel a little bit better. @CAPS2!"", it hit me like a brick in the head. Hearing that my brother got put back in jail was a hard thing to hear. He had just gotten out from a four month sentence, three months ago. One of the hardest things is thinking of what to say @CAPS6 his three year old son, @PERSON1, asks ""@CAPS3's @CAPS4?"". The main reason I'm not as scared for my brother as I was is because of my nephew @PERSON1. He can light up any situation with his adorable laugh. So whenever my brother gets thrown back into jail, I know everything will be okay @CAPS6 I see a big smile on @PERSON1's little chubby face. He is my inspiration to smile @CAPS6 I feel like there is absolutely nothing in this word to smile or laugh about. Even @CAPS6 we were both sitting in the emergency room he still just kept on laughing.  Being @CAPS5 is the absolute worst thing in the world to me. I hate not being able to get out of bed and go places. All I usually do is go stuff outside with my friends, but @CAPS6 I'm @CAPS5 I cant do anything. The only things I can really do is take nasty medicine. Recently I was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pains. Then not even two weeks later I was back in the emergency room with strep. I was in a lot of pain for about four weeks all together. one thing I hate more then being @CAPS5, is people feeling bad for me being @CAPS5. So whenever I'm @CAPS5 I always crack jokes and make people laugh no matter how much it hurts me to laugh. Even though the laughing did not feel good physically, it sure made me feel a lot better emotionally. Laughing is like my brand of medicine for @CAPS6 I'm not feeling well. It seems to make me feel better faster then any other over the counter medicine. Especially for breaking up with my first ""love"". ""I just don't want my mistakes to hurt you anymore"", that was the last thing he said to me. My first ""love"" just left me standing alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears. It was my first real break-up. I was having a pretty hard time dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up my friends came and picked me up. They told me that I needed to be cheered up. @CAPS6 we got into town we stopped by the store. My friend @PERSON3 told me to pick out a half gallon of ice-cream, so I got mint chocolate chip. We finally got to @PERSON3's house and he told me that I had to eat the whole half gallon of ice cream to myself. Of course I didn't argue. While I was eating the ice cream him and my friend @PERSON2 put on a little skit of how they were going to be up my ex boyfriend. I was laughing so hard I got a brain freeze. By the time the skit was over I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughing made me forget that I was sad in the first place. I felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together. While I was with my ex we never hung out because i was always with him. I had a blast that day and I will remember it forever. Laughing is truly the key to living a great life. ""@CAPS6 life gives you lemons make lemonade"", that is a quote that I chose to listen to and try to follow. To me the quote is just saying to enjoy the little things in life. So whenever I laugh, I am enjoying a little pleasures in life. Laughing is a part of my life no matter how hard life @MONTH1 seem. So even if my brother is in jail, I'm @CAPS5, or i just got dumped; I laugh so that I don't have to worry anymore. Laughter is a main ingredient to everyone's life, don't forget it or life wont turn out the way that anyone would want it.

20812,8," Laughter. We all need it. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder that @CAPS7 is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. And, in my opinion, most importantly, @CAPS8 a reminder that even though we @MONTH1 make mistakes, @CAPS7 is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it.   In the @DATE1, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. The children, of course, were not invited. We were to either stay home with the babysitter, or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 was nothing to do. One of my best friends, @PERSON2, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick phone call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was about five in the @TIME1, and I was to be back no later then nine. I had four hours, and it was two weeks before @CAPS1. Neither of us knew @CAPS13 to do with so much time on our hands. After all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. This way new to both of us. We were both sophomores, and I had a crush on @LOCATION1. This turned out to be a big problem, considering @CAPS6 knew this piece of information. @CAPS6 didn't have a problem with it, but @PERSON1, her boyfriend, did. We got along, but he didn't like the fact that I was spending so much time with her, especially while he wasn't @CAPS7. He trusted me to take care of her though, so he didn't make a huge deal out of it.   We had decided to set up the @CAPS1 tree first, and go from @CAPS7. We both had @CAPS3, so just about everything on the tree was shiny. Tinsels, ornaments, pictures, @CAPS14 name it. It took about twenty minutes to get everything set up, not including the time it took to unpack all the decorations. It looked magnificent when we were done. I'd help make some pretty @CAPS12 looking trees, but this was by far the best. I was proud of our work. I didn't have much in my life to appreciate, so this was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became really important. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. @PERSON2 got on the @CAPS4 to talk to @PERSON1 for a bit, while texted my girlfriend. I was in the process of preparing myself to break up with her.   @PERSON3 and I had been together for most of my sophomore year, and I was beginning to regret it. Our relationship had started when one of my buddies, @PERSON4, and hers ended. I know this sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I was putting myself between @PERSON4 and her so that they would stop fighting so much. Now I was starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. @CAPS6 was like a bad drug that got @CAPS14 really high, and then dropped @CAPS14 like a rock. @CAPS6 was extremely controlling. @CAPS6 wasn't @CAPS12 for me, and @PERSON2 had finally convinced me that enough was enough. After I broke up with @PERSON3, I felt both happy, and depressed. I was happy that I could be free, but I was depressed because I felt so alone. I'd never been @CAPS12 at getting close to people, so this was hard for me to do.   Seeing me so roughed up didn't sit well with @PERSON2. @CAPS6 knew me much better then most people, so @CAPS6 knew that I needed help quick. @CAPS6 did something so subtle, that to most it would have seemed unimportant. @CAPS6 took one look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think it was a @CAPS12 idea. Her boyfriend was very protective of @PERSON2. He didn't like guys getting close to her, under any circumstances.   ""@CAPS5 @CAPS14 please just try to relax for a minute? Your making me nervous."" @CAPS6 said in that tone that meant it was more of an order then a question. Maybe it was the fact that I was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me. I started laughing really hard.   ""@CAPS7. That wasn't so hard, was it?"" @CAPS8 @CAPS6 pulled away from the embrace, I kissed forehead; our way of saying ""your beautiful.""   ""@CAPS9 @CAPS14 going to be okay?"" @CAPS6 asked in a worried voice.   ""@CAPS11, I'll be fine. Thanks @PERSON2.""   ""@CAPS12. @CAPS14 never showed me that guitar thing.""   ""@CAPS13 guitar thing?""   ""@CAPS14 said @CAPS14 played guitar."" @CAPS15 then I realized that I might not ever get another friend @CAPS8 @CAPS12 @CAPS8 this one.   ""@CAPS16 @CAPS11. Come on. I'll show @CAPS14 how to play @CAPS17 man.""",20.0,19.0,40.0,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,,,":**

20813,8," As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. Since I was young I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be."" @CAPS1 by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  When ever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. It @MONTH1 be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. Most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. With all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. I have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring.",18.0,18.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

20814,8," Laughter is a mystery. Happens @CAPS2 ever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extream, unforgettable. Things you could never forget.  Around two months ago, in the cold @DATE1. It was my @NUM1 birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. @CAPS2 everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me whats going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddie @PERSON3 and my boyfriend @PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a @NUM1 pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed ""@CAPS1 up the cars, and let's go!"" @CAPS2 we approached the @ORGANIZATION1, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister in law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extream and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in peoples hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold,wet and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worse. Even now the shoes i was wearing are stained. @CAPS2 we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose. I swore i was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling outta my hair and clothing, the sauce steaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olvis. You @MONTH1 think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend @CAPS3 dropped nachos on my couch. @PERSON3 threw nacho cheese at @LOCATION1, she threw chips at @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON3 tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese fest. I couldn't believe that nacho cheese got stuck in my dogs fer and in all the girls hair. Chip crumbs were in the couch and cheese was on the floor and @CAPS4 tree. So @PERSON3 finally said""@CAPS5 more nachos!""  @CAPS6 on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. She cries on our birthdays because she says its just a year closer to her kids moving out. I figured she would be use to it knowing that she already had two kids move out. All of a sudden there was frosting on my face! I rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on @PERSON1 face. Though he just rubbed it back onto mine. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it at @LOCATION2, she tossed it at @CAPS3 then @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON3 then @PERSON2. Chocolate frosting was everywhere along with nacho cheese. Soon after that we played video games. Of course me being me I played @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @NUM3 live on @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't to pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, ill see you @CAPS6, peace out dude. We said it all. I looked back in the living room and say nothing but huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken t.v. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You @MONTH1 not see it right away. Though you will @CAPS2 you started laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on there faces. It @MONTH1 also make a mess and put things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after them crazy situations that you would go back and do it again.

20815,8,"                              Laughter                               @PERSON1   Laughter has many benefits that make us have might make us have more distance in between two people or maybe make us have differenceses in between the relationships you have with people. But many other people believe and (think) that laughter is an important part of any relationship with your friends, family ect. Now I'm going to talk about a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit to us, and how it can also make us have distances from people, or how laughter works in between relashionships we have with friends. Many people think that it's really fun to laugh about simple things and thats me I can laugh for things that might not seem funning to others, but to me they might seem extremely funny. I won't stop laughing for a while. But many other poeple don't consider laughter as funny, as many others. I believe that laughter is an important part of us because it shows people around you the way you are and how you express your self on things. Many of your friends or even your family will know what type of person you are and how silly you can get to be sometimes. Thats the reason why I think it's a great idea or (thing) to do around, just have some fun and laugh. Now talking about relashionship in between people. Do you think that laughter can be an important part of any relationship or how could it help us (ways)????? Well yes I do think that laughter can be extremely important in many relationship we have with people. You get to know and others get to know about you and how you are.  Eventhough many relationships that we have with our friends, family, or with new people we meet. I believe that laughter tells you how a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them. Laughter expresses how that person is and wheither they are fun people to be around. Laughter even tells you if that person has a lot of humor, just a little, or doesn't have any humor at all. When people don't have that much humor they really don't understand and get the funny parts from jokes or anything. I also think that laughter is really important to any type of relationship you have with anybody, because that makes you know that person a lot better. But other people consider laughter being a reason that distances two people from each other.I don't considerlaughter being a reason for to people to have distances in between. The reasons why I think and say this is becasue their are many people that laugh a lot almost crying and they don't have distances in between other people or anything. They might get more friends or more people to talk to them becasue other people as well might see how that person is and they might see that the person is really fun to be around with. I know this becasue I laugh a lot and that hasn't happened to me. Thats why I don't consider and don't believe that laughter is being the reason to have distances in between people (relationship). In my opinion I consider laughter a very important part of who we are, the way we think, and also the things we like to do. What I mean by this is that you can have some humor but you don't actually express the way you are thinking about what other do. Or if something is super silly and theirs a new kid at school and you or someone else says something you might probably think that it's funny but you might just not want to laugh at that moment becasue you @MONTH1 a little to shy or simply becasuue you might not know that person as well and maybe the other person won't have enough confidence to laugh with you for whatever silly thing someone just said. Although many people still should laugh whenever they want. Sometimes if you laugh a lot you might be the happiest and funniest person anywhere. Or whenever somebody is sad you might as well be the only person theri who can make her/him laugh and happy. In addition these were some of the reasons why i think that laughter is great for you, that way people will get to know you better. These were a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit,how it can distance people.",15.0,16.0,,31.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

20817,8,"          There are times I get along with others and times I don't. There also are times where I make others laugh until they cry. Like this one time me and my friends where walking to the store, I start pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, he started laughing so hard that he literally peed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into some clean cloth, and it took him @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked @CAPS6 he was doing in there, and he said. ""I'm taking a pee."" @CAPS2 I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when it hit me why he was laughing so hard about me pointing out the @CAPS1 store. It was because the last time we had gone inside and there was a man talking about his son's football team which my friend and I was on at the time, was in the top ten. Guss @CAPS6 we really weren't. The man felt so afraid of @CAPS6 the lady he was talking to might think of him. So @CAPS5 gets up and says to us. ""@CAPS4 you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second."" @CAPS5 gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. ""@CAPS6 about me? How come I don't get a hug."" That when I started to laugh harder @CAPS2 heck.

20818,8,"@CAPS4 fills the air around us with happiness and joy, @CAPS4 brings warm memory's of loved ones that are close to us , and adds a splash of hope to those who need @CAPS4. Laughter is the key to solving life's problems.@CAPS4 is a way of adding something special into our life and comes from many different areas of life .Laughter could come from a pitiful joke that someone could have told you,@CAPS4 could be brought up by a show, and @CAPS4 could also come from the joy we get when a near loved one has returning home from a long journey. Imagine seeing something comical like a person falling down or crashing into a pole , the moment right when that happens you hear your self laughing as hard as you can that you practically cant breath and the person standing right next to you is joining in on the laugh. Although @CAPS3 might seem rude and disrespectful you have just made a bond with the person right next to you and found a similarity between the both of you. @CAPS3 is how friendships are brought up and made, just by one little thing that made you both laugh and have a connection with each other can trigger a brand new friendship between to people that could either last a minute or can last a life time. In my case @CAPS3 is how I met one of my closest friend ever , we had seen a student from our class trying to show the class how cool he was by climbing up the flag pole and replace the @ORGANIZATION1 state flag with his own personal home made flag ( he got the @CAPS1 off of a show ) ,as he was heading up the pole almost half way their he must have gotten scared because minutes later he started yelling for help, a minute later the faculty members finally heard his cry's and yells and tried to get him down from ware he was, @CAPS4 took them almost half an hour to get him down. @CAPS3 was the moment ware I had made one of the greatest friendship I've ever had in my life. Many friendships are made in class and with the people you go to work with but a great friendship is brought up by a simple laugh two people share with each other. God laugh's last. @CAPS3 is the name of @PERSON1 son of @CAPS2 and @PERSON2. In @CAPS3 story @PERSON2 the @CAPS5 of @PERSON1 claimed that she was surprised when she was blessed with her only child and that people would laugh and be surprised the same way she was when they hear the news. Being surprised or shocked can also bring some one to laugh at what either happened in their surroundings or what they did them self's. I remembered a time ware I laughed at something that took me by surprise, @CAPS4 was when my @CAPS5 lost the keys to the house inside the car, we looked for them every ware but had no luck finding them, after an hour had pass we called my dad so he would bring the other key to the house, after we called him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get their but as soon as my father parked in the driveway my @CAPS5 found the key that she lost inside her pocket (@CAPS4 was a typical cartoon moment).When we heard the news we all just started laughing at what has just happen, we were all shocked and a little dumbfounded when that happened. As you can see being surprise can also bring a smile and a laugh onto someones face. Picture yourself staring into the eyes of some one close to you with a blank face and trying not to let out the slightest bit of a giggle or a smile and then find yourself laughing nonstop for no reason. That is basically an every day thing for me and my sister. My sister and I can't stare at each other for even a minute, we eventually start laughing the first five seconds and end up laughing a hole hour without stop, but as soon as we stop laughing we note's that we were laughing for no apparent reason , which would make us laugh for another hour more.That the kind of laughter that two people that are so close to each other get , the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh but you end up laughing for no reason at all.@CAPS3 shows the connection two people have with each other the type ware you know what the other person is thinking. Laughter can come from old memory's of family gatherings for the holidays , friendships we made when we were in school , memory's of our childhood and how thing we thought then were in style and cool are k now thing we look back into and laugh at, by being a little surprise, and can also be The fact that we know someone by heart .",16.0,16.0,,32.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20819,8," LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter. I think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy.

20821,8,"Laughter's @CAPS1 Laughter is everywhere. It @MONTH1 be three doors down reclining in a comfy living room. It @MONTH1 be at the nearest playground bouncing on the teeter-totter. It @MONTH1 be at an elegant restaurant sitting at a petite table in the distant corner. For me, it lingered in an old fifth grade classroom. I stumbled through the doorway carrying @CAPS11 purple backpack and @CAPS11 lunch pale resting in @CAPS11 left hand. I recognized everyone from @CAPS11 previous years of elementary school, and shortly joined them after visiting @CAPS11 hook outside the door. I had been waiting anxiously for @CAPS11 turn at the fifth grade. The legendary @PERSON1, was known as the ""coolest"" teacher around. He played a large role in the gossip of the young students, and each of us had our hopes set high. ""@CAPS2 your seats @NUM1 graders!"" announced @PERSON1 @CAPS3 with a contagious smile. Kids scattered around to room searching for seats near their closest friends. Everyone listened attentively to @PERSON1's introduction to the year. His voice caught our full attention, but not too exciting compared to our expectations. He appeared very nice as most teachers come, but still nothing spectacular. The day dragged on. The sleepy faces returned and the vivid colors had escaped our touch. The day finally reached an end, not satisfying the eager children. The next day rose quickly and I trudged back to the disappointing classroom. To @CAPS11 surprise, the next day was nothing like the first. The classroom @CAPS7 experienced a drastic change. Every wall was filled with endless color. Posters layered over the plain paint with fascinating pictures and words. A fancy popcorn machine rested in the back of the room. Fresh popcorn overflowed from inside. The smell traveled through our needy nostrils as we entered. Mr. @CAPS3 sat contently at his broad desk as we made our way to our seats once again. He welcomed us to our second day. After the first couple minutes of class I had found that the rumors were true. He had a sense of simple humor that created giggles in every corner of the class. His ideas and word choice related to us as @NUM1 graders. We found his subtle jokes quite amusing to our young minds. He spoke like we spoke, he acted like we acted, and he joked like we joked. He even created customized nicknames for each of us. Laughter hung over our heads like a heavy @CAPS1, never continuing along. Weekly popcorn servers would hand out stuffed bags to all the kids as the class read aloud. Kids became ecstatic on jeopardy @CAPS4 gathering teams as quick as possible. His classroom became a place that we wanted to stay forever, never parting from hour long games and water chugging contests. Despite the everlasting fun and games, @PERSON1 showed us what it was really like to be a learner. He cared about our future and pushed us to strive in every moment of life. He taught us to write with desire and worth. To express our feelings on paper and tell the world a story that we want heard. He would plan one on one time with students struggling in a particular subject, and next class their confidence had bloomed. He had an ability to reach into our minds, find out who we were, and emerge that hidden confidence to become @CAPS9. We respected him, yet felt comfortable messing around with him during class as he had frequently done to us. @PERSON1 gave us a craving to learn.  @DATE1 @TIME1, I had began to walk home, when @PERSON1 @CAPS3 stopped me at the door.  ""@CAPS6 @PERSON2C!"" I unexpectedly said in a high tone, not hiding @CAPS11 enthusiasm. He chuckled, ""@CAPS7 fun at class today?"" ""@CAPS8 yeah,"" I answered with a grin. ""I'm glad"" he continued, then changing the subject, ""I was thinking about having a huge dodge ball tournament at recess tomorrow. Do @CAPS10 think that would be a good idea?"" I snickered to myself, trying to comprehend the fact that an adult had said this to me, ""That would be so fun."" ""@CAPS9,"" he expressed quite excited, ""@CAPS10 are a really neat kid, @CAPS10 know that? Its a lot of fun having @CAPS10 in class."" @CAPS11 face lit up. I stood there smiling for quite some time. We finished our slight conversation and I continued home. Every student in the class yearned to be liked by @PERSON1, as if he were the most popular kid at school. I was liked by @PERSON2 I was liked by the man that changed @CAPS11 whole outlook on education and life. Gradually, from time to time, I drift back to the careless days of @NUM1 grade and @PERSON2 I still laugh at the ridiculous events that occurred in that small classroom each and every day. Frequently, I glance above me to witness that dense @CAPS1 that still hovers above me. Laughter has left a mark on me, and those kids of @CAPS11 @NUM1 grade class.

20822,8," Laughing is one of the key components in all my relationships with others. It lightens the mood of any situation and can really lift my sprits when I'm having a bad day. It is often the ice breaker when I meet someone new and can help me get closer to the friends I already have.  On the first day of school, freshman year, I met a girl named @LOCATION1. We were in writing class and there was a boy named @CAPS1 sitting between us. @CAPS1 and I were talking about our schedules, and he said something that made our conversation slightly uncomforatable. I looked up and saw that @LOCATION1 had heard what he had said and had a look on her face that was somewhere between being embarrassed for me and close to laughing. I smiled at her and mouthed the word ""awkward"" when @CAPS1 turned away. This was her cue that it was okay to laugh, and she did so subtly. I didn't know that this first laugh would lead to many more in a friendship that would develop almost instantly. After the first week of schedules being changed and students being shuffled around, we found out that we had every single one of our classes together, except @CAPS3. We probably spent more time laughing in those classes than getting work done, and I'm not exactly sure how we managed to pass all our classes. Spending so much time together, it was only a matter of time before we had enough inside jokes to fill up a dictionary. Nearly any word or just the sight of something related to one of our jokes can send us into a fit of laughter. Sometimes, we don't have to say anything at all. I'll just look at her, and we'll burst out laughing. Because of this, our friends often question our sanity. When we start laughing, they'll look at eachother, and then at us for a clue as to why, or ask if we are okay. They don't understand us the way we understand eachother. People always get our names mixed up even though we look nothing alike. Our names dont even rhyme, or start with the same letter. But I can't really blame them. We're so much alike! From the activities we participate in to the way we think, we could almost be the same person. She makes me laugh every single day, and she's one of my best friends. @CAPS4 is another one of my friends who is constantly making me crack up. Whenever I'm with her, I'm always terrified of peeing in my pants. She's not as close to me as @LOCATION1 is, but we've gotten to be such better friends this year. We have a lot of classes together this year, and that's probably why we've gotten closer. We're always doing stupid stuff together, and laughing about it the whole time. For example, she and I like to laugh obnoxiously loud and exaggerate our ""ha's"" when someone tells a really lame or cheesy joke. Our biotech teacher loves to tell cheesy jokes, so when we're in his class, we sit together anticipating one of his jokes so that we can laugh. We also like to chew our gum with our mouths open, in order to make the chewing noise louder. I often laugh so hard that I can't even chew. I know I'll have a good day if I'm with @CAPS4. She can make me laugh in a way a lot of my other friends can't. It comes deep from within, to the point where you can't even breathe, and tears and running down your face. It makes your entire face is sore, even your eyes, from being scrunched up for so long. She's such a fun person to be around, and I'm glad to have her as one of my friends. Laughing is a very important part in the relationships I have with other people. If my friends couldn't make me laugh, our friendship would be so much more boring. Nothing would be fun. If I never laughed, I'd never be happy, and that's not a life I'm willing to try. Life is hard. It's not easy, and it's not always going to be smiles and smooth sailing. There's going to be sadness and rough waters. But no matter how tough this life @MONTH1 get, I know I'll have friends like @LOCATION1 and @CAPS4 there to share a laugh.",25.0,20.0,,45.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,,,"**Ideas and Content**

20823,8," Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, ""@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS8,"" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language.""",21.0,20.0,,41.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":**

20824,8,"The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter, one of the best feelings an individual can achieve. When you're feeling sad, angry, or in an argument, laughing can turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you @MONTH1 not want to show the turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood. Laughing with someone is even better still. Having laughter-filled relationships is an important element to someone's well being. Sharing a @CAPS3 is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving. Relationships without laughter soon end. It is almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed in relationships often. Without it, there is no connection, joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to @CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled ""I @CAPS2 to @CAPS3."" I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to @CAPS3 together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious.  Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to @CAPS3 when someone else is laughing. Everyone has their own @CAPS3 too. Sometimes, it is someone's @CAPS3 that provokes laughter within the group. Making others @CAPS3 is a wonderful feeling as well. Comedians make a career out of making people @CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @CAPS3. @PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS2 his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @CAPS3. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group @MONTH1 be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body. Such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals. Norman @CAPS4' book, ""Laughter is the best medicine"" explains the powers of laughter in detail. @CAPS4 watched The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and laughed himself to wellness. He shows how one needs laughter to be well. Laughter is so very important to a person's health. It raises the spirits and lightens moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if one doesn't have enough laughter in his life, he @MONTH1 not be as healthy as he could be. If your friendships are lacking humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,,,,,"**Ideas and Content**

20825,8," In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust is very important in an relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 year's of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister, and everything else to me. Me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other but we will always be there to help the other one out for what ever reason it @MONTH1 be. those are the @NUM3 thing i think you need to have a good relationship with someone like i do with my cousin @CAPS1. and i still have this relationship with her and i will never be able to lose it no matter how hard i try to i now she will always be by my side.",15.0,18.0,,33.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20826,8," Bell rings.  Shuffle, shuffle. @CAPS1. Snap. EEEE. Crack. Slam. Click, stomp, @CAPS1. Tap tap tap. SLAM. Creak. Shoof, shoof.  Sigh. Seventh class of the day. Here we go. ""@CAPS2! Tu va ou pas? On a +¬tude cette class-l+á. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux...."" @CAPS3 all blinked at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate-haired and mocha skinned, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @CAPS3 didn't really care if I came or not. It made no difference to them if I trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy. I was silent but adorable, loved only because I was an @CAPS4. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5. Because I was the exchange student, because my translator and colorful clothes were so shocking for ten seconds, and were then forgotten about.  I was a flock of seagulls haircut. So why are you here? I thought. Why did you go on exchange at all? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home.  But my ego had a ready answer. You begged for this remember? For months and months, it was all you wanted, all you thought about, all you dreamt about. So I went with the girls. As expected, @CAPS3 walked down the three-person wide staircase side-by-side, and I shuffled awkwardly behind them. Finally arriving at @NUM2scalier, we sat at a table, the three girls talking. I glazed my eyes over, attempting to look lost in thought, as if I didn't care I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed in my head; if @CAPS3 weren't talking to me, why should I make the effort to talk to them?   I really had no idea how @CAPS3 felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS3 notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. It's all in the confidence, said my mother's voice, all how you carry yourself. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing.  This caught the interest of @PERSON1, as @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1 were discussing something very emotional. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Sniffling, she and @NUM1le went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @PERSON1. Only @PERSON2 could have felt my felt my same emotion as he stared up at @CAPS6. Silently, I continued shooting peas. @PERSON1 just stared at them as @CAPS3 darted around the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then, he turned around and swore. And then, @PERSON1 and I looked at each other from across the table.  And then, we laughed.  We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. It was saturated with all the angst and lonliness and despair I had felt the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightening, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life.  Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. Laughter. GASP. This is why. I thought. This is why you came.

Then @CAPS2 left me alone to think. I needed to move on? How? Life wasn't that easy. I knew that. I opened up my note book to do some homework to get my mind off @PERSON2, @CAPS5, @CAPS3 @PERSON3. That's when I discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards. I flipped it over, showing that it was a picture. A tear leaked out of the corner of eye. It was of me @CAPS3 @PERSON2. We were both in a mud pit. My blond hair looked like dirt ( considering that I had been rolling in mud). My pit bull was rubbing @CAPS1 greasy head on my shoulder smearing more mud on to myself. I smiled, missing him even more, @CAPS6 feeling a lot better then a minute before. I loved him. I loved him so much. I still do this day, @CAPS6 I had to get over that my friend was gone.

20829,8," The bus flew around tightly wound corners. Beyond the windows, farmland, rocky bluffs, and peaceful rivers streamed past. Exhausted from the fourteen hour flight, I barely knew what time it was. The only things keeping me awake were the jolting of the bus and @NUM1 other @CAPS1 I barely knew gossiping quietly. We were going to visit and live with a group high school students, affectionately referred to as ""our @CAPS2."" I had met @CAPS16 partner, @LOCATION1, only once. Everything I knew about her, her life, her family I learned from maybe ten, maybe @NUM2 short @CAPS3 messages. Communication was going to be problematic. @CAPS16 mother started teaching me @CAPS4 when I turned two, but I was nowhere near fluent; I was self-conscience and uncomfortable around native speakers. @PERSON1's @CAPS5 was decent, but her family spoke only @CAPS4. Finally, the bus drove down the narrow cobbled streets of @CAPS7. It pulled up to a plaza packed with people. The doors hissed open, and we filed out into the crowd, standing on tiptoes to search for our new families. All around me, people chattered in a mix of @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERSON1 and her parents waited somewhere in the middle, and I slowly wove @CAPS16 way towards them. Brigitte, @CAPS16 host mother, grabbed me in a hug. ""@CAPS10 gehts? @CAPS10 war dein @PERSON2? How @CAPS18 you? How was your flight?""  @CAPS11 of @CAPS16 @CAPS4, I faltered, ""@CAPS13 @PERSON2 war sehr langalso ich bin ein bisschen muede. The flight was very long, so I'm a little tired."" @PERSON1 took @CAPS16 arm and led me uphill towards the school, where our welcome dinner was being held. She explained, ""@CAPS14 is very excited to meet you. @CAPS7 is so small; we never get tourists. We only get @CAPS15 exchange students every other year."" @CAPS16 stomach was filled with that jittery-sick feeling of nervous anticipation. Normally, making friends was easy for me, but this time was different. I only minimally understood the language and culture of the people surrounding me. The long flight was evident in the sleepless bags under @CAPS16 eyes and @CAPS16 greasy, knotted hair. @CAPS16 jet-lagged brain wondered how I would get along with these people. Would I fit in, be able to slip into @CAPS4 life without many hitches or snags? We passed from the antiquated street to a dusky tunnel-like entryway. After a few turns, we emerged into an open courtyard. An array of food covered several tables, and the scent of grilling bratwurst wafted through the air. ""@CAPS18 you hungry? You should have something to eat. We have so much food here,"" @PERSON1 told me. I grabbed a plate and placed a roll, strawberries, and a sausage on it; I was too anxious to really be hungry. @PERSON1 steered me towards a worn table with wooden benches, where her friends were already enjoying dinner and a few beers. She introduced me, and I perched stiffly on the edge of the seat. @CAPS14 talked excitedly, questioning me about @CAPS15 life. As @CAPS14 loosened up, they began to joke, sometimes in @CAPS4, sometimes in @CAPS5. Some of the @CAPS2 teased me about @CAPS16 accent. It wasn't a mean teasing; they weren't trying to be malicious, just light and funny. So I laughed. In that moment, I seemed to fit better with these people I only sometimes understood. I was less a foreigner and more a new friend. Relaxing, I allowed myself to laugh at @CAPS16 mistakes and really enjoy being someplace entirely new.",25.0,24.0,,49.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,5,,,":** The essay is clear, focused, and interesting.

20830,8," My friend @PERSON1 and I have @CAPS1 friends from as back as sixth grade. We have @CAPS1 through so much together. Even though we don't have everything in common and we don't hang out, out side of school together, we have a lot of laughter in our friendship. I say that if you are gonna have a friendship that is gonna last, you have to have laughter in it to make it a fun friendship. When @PERSON1 and I where in @NUM1 grade, we where the biggest people to the sixth graders because we where in the highest grade in our middle school. We would have so much stuff to do. @PERSON1 and I would always walk down the hallways linking our arms together and one moment after another she would just push me into someone. That someone would plow into a locker or wall and we would just laugh are butts off. It was fun to us but the other people kinda minded, but not that bad.  Another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when @PERSON1 and I would have big tickle fights. It would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths. I would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth and to get me to stop, @PERSON1 would tickle me. @PERSON1 new that I'm like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. One time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school. We tickled and tickled each other till we where laughing our butts off on the flour. Well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes. Well @PERSON1 was the office aid and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we where going out. @PERSON1 told me that she just said ""@CAPS3"" and started to chuckle. I got a big laugh out of that. Laughter is a vary good thing to me because without it, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't be best friends as we are today in @NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship all started off of laughter. I met @PERSON1 in the sixth grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher had assigned seats and @PERSON1 and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon enough she introduced her self and so did I. Well the seating arrangement changed and she sat somewhere ells and so did I. Well the person she sat by moved away. I had a bad grade in @CAPS4 class and I told my teacher I wasn't getting along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere ells. He told me yes and so I went over and asked @PERSON1 if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. She told me that she didn't care and so then on out we started hanging in school together and had so much fun.  So you see. Laughter is a grate deal in a lot of peoples life's. You need it. Without it I would of never made my best friend who I have today. I have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. Without the laughter in this world we would be lost probably. Just think about what you might not have or what you might be missing if you didn't have laughter in your life.",17.0,16.0,,33.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20831,8, I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the bull dogs in @LOCATION1. We were losing in first half and before first half got over one of our goalies got his hand hurt. So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him. So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them. After first half we scored @NUM1 goals so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3 . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.  ,14.0,15.0,,29.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay is about a funny incident that happened during a soccer game.

20832,8," Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and @CAPS7 fall @CAPS3 their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't of laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how @CAPS7 fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life that their isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun and @CAPS7 always make me laugh. Their isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say ""awkward silence."" We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call ""good times."" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day @CAPS3 @DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1 and sat down @CAPS3 a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3."" I got my hair done, did my make-up, put my dress @CAPS3, went outside to take pictures, and got @CAPS3 the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name @CAPS7 ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell ""@ORGANIZATION2"", with two guys wearing black @CAPS3 each end, but @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS8""! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS9""! I'm am not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could of stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life.

20833,8," Laughter is a great thing, except for some instances. We all have been there. Having a good time with friends, laughing and making new memories. Then you take a drink of something and start laughing again. Next thing you know you're choking and can't breathe. You're coughing as much as you can, trying to stop. It's not only a little embarrassing, but it can get a little awkward too. You can't stop it, you just have to let nature take its course. Everyone stares, asking if you're alright. The moment feels like forever, and that was exactly how I felt. I have two best friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. It was during the @DATE1 and we decided to have ourselves a little movie night at @ORGANIZATION3's house. We were fully prepared with candy, soda pops, and the best of all, pizza. It all added up for a great night. We decided to watch the movie @ORGANIZATION1. It's all of our favorites, I don't think we could ever grow tired of it. @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and I found comfortable seating arrangements and started to watch the movie. We were eating, laughing hard-core and making comments along with it. We were having a great time. Then I decided to take a drink of my @ORGANIZATION2. I was about to swallow it, but just my luck, one of the funniest parts in the movie was on. I started to laugh and knew I had an issue. I put my cup on the table, quickly got off the couch, and took two steps when most of the @LOCATION1 in my mouth came flying out onto the floor. I couldn't breathe and was now coughing, so I kept running to my destination, the kitchen sink. I was about two feet away from the sink, I was so close! Then I felt something come up my mouth that I couldn't control. I wasn't going to open my mouth, it'd be all over the floor! I was so grossed out I basically threw myself at the sink. My mouth opened and there went the puke, into the sink. I continued to cough, wondering when it would it would all end. ""@CAPS2 you okay?!"" @CAPS1 ran into the kitchen and started hitting my upper back, trying to help me out. @CAPS5 hit me three times, then I could finally breathe again. ""@CAPS4 you, I was having a hard time."" @CAPS5 started laughing, while I was still disgusted with the nasty taste left in my mouth. I put my head under the faucet trying to clear it out a little. I grabbed a towel, and we made our way to the living room. We entered the room to find @PERSON1 sitting on the couch, laughing hysterically. @CAPS1 sat by her, and started to giggle a little along with her. I got on my knees and started wiping up the @ORGANIZATION2 spill on the floor. There wasn't too much, but still a good amount. I started to chuckle a little to myself while cleaning it up. I thought to myself, ""@CAPS6 must I always be the one to choke?"" ""@CAPS6 didn't you just go to the bathroom sink? I mean it's right there!"" @PERSON1 was pointing to the door and still laughing. ""I didn't think of that! I just ran for the kitchen!"" I've been to her house plenty of times before, but the bathroom slipped my mind. I laughed at how much of a blond moment I had just had. ""@CAPS8 my gosh,"" @CAPS5 laughed a little then continued, ""@CAPS9 me of @CAPS10! When I saved you!"" ""@CAPS11 up and watch the movie!"" I told her jokingly. @CAPS5 finished laughing and we were enjoying the movie in peace again. They both still tease me about that, but I don't mind. It just goes to show you the things laughter can unexpectedly bring.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20835,8," Has there ever been a person that you know, that just made you laugh like no one else could? Or had a moment or a @DATE1 when you laughed as if there was no tomorrow? Laughter is something that everyone can relate to no matter the age or the personality. It fills you with warm feeling that spills out like a waterfall. There isn't always a reason for the things that people do, there is always mystery. The same thing applies to laughter. Sometimes you are just so happy that it all builds up inside and has to be let out. During the @DATE2 of my sixth, going on seventh grade year, my friend @PERSON1 and I were nearly inseparable. @PERSON1 was the first friend that I had made upon moving from @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 in the beginning of my sixth grade year, but in a short amount of time we became best friends. On @DATE1, we were at my house by ourselves and we wanted to do something fun, and creative. So we decided to make a fort out of sheets and furniture. We took chairs and the ends of some couches and @DATE1 tables and tied sheets and blankets from them, falling over ourselves and not paying attention to anything else. We made a plane of fabric about three or four feet above the ground, tall enough to crawl under and sit down. We then took a tack in the wall and pinned a sheet to hang over the flat sheet as our walls. We then filled the make shift tent with pillows and blankets to sit on. By the @DATE1 of our adventure, the living room was a mess and the furniture was all over the place. It was as if a tornado had run through the house, even though it wasn't the biggest or best fort we had built. But we didn't care, we had a blast building it. I remember sitting in the fort and talking to her about anything that came up. We talked about school, people and just life in general. We made jokes like we love to do and just fed off of each others good feelings and energy. I was on cloud nine and no one was about to bring me down. That @DATE1, I laughed like there was nothing wrong in the world. I was carefree and wasn't afraid to show it. We were both laughing almost constantly to the point of tears, even though, when I look back now some of the things that we laughed about, weren't all that funny. It was one of those days with the laughs that fill you up with so much energy and joy that you can't even contain yourself, and it is so contagious that others can't help but join you. We let ourselves out in cries of joy and cackles. I had never laughed so hard in my life and I never wanted it to stop. It wasn't necessarily because of something funny that @PERSON1 had done or said, but I was just so happy that everything seemed worthy of laughing about. And every time I started to laugh, she couldn't help but join me, and that would just set us off laughing harder. By the @DATE1, we were both emotionally drained. @PERSON1 ended up staying the night because we never wanted the @DATE1 to leave. But, eventually, every @DATE1 ends, every morning is a new beginning and every night an @DATE1 to something, but when you close your eyes to sleep after a long @DATE1 of laughing, you feel full. Not of happiness, but of life. And that feeling, is not something that is easily taken away. So live and laugh like today is the last @DATE1, and never forget the memories that you created in the times before.",20.0,18.0,40.0,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5,20,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

20836,8,"         The @CAPS1 Of Laughter In @CAPS2 @CAPS3 me laughter is important, we all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @CAPS3 listen and pay attention. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime. For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. what has kept our @CAPS2 strong and still alive today, is the memories we have created through laughter. One memory I always seem @CAPS3 remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together.   There have been many memories made between @PERSON1 and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. It was our seventh grade @DATE1 and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had @CAPS3 babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we did hang out it was always so much fun. Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @CAPS2. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That @DATE1 we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. Then one day @ORGANIZATION1's parent's had decided that they wanted @CAPS3 take a trip @CAPS3 the lake and go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me @CAPS3 come along, and so I asked and I was able @CAPS3 go with their family @CAPS3 the lake. I had been boating before, and @CAPS3 the lake that we were going too. What I was not expecting, was for @PERSON1 and I @CAPS3 go inner-tubing. It was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @LOCATION1 in my life.Going inner-tubing turned out @CAPS3 be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire @DATE1 whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story @CAPS3 tell everyone and we were both proud of it. When inner-tubing we had learned @CAPS3 work together and it helped our @CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also when inner-tubing we got @CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  That @DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @CAPS3 laughter. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter I do not know where my @CAPS2 with @PERSON1 would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

Until my sister reminded me of it and told me that story. I just start laughing from that day on.

20840,8,"  In any situation laughter is used. Many times have I been in an awkward position that i have used laughter to free myself from discomfort. Laughter will never go away and you will always have it with you to use when it is needed in a revolting moment. For example, @CAPS1 a month ago i was walking to the park with my brother and some friends of mine. When we arrived there were already people at the skateboarding spot we wanted to skate at. We decided no big deal we will just go on with our business and skate. ""@CAPS2 punks! we were here first!"" one of them said. Me and my brother started yelling back. Then one of them got in my face and started talking a bunch of trash so i said something @CAPS1 him that was so funny that all his friends laughed to. He was pretty pissed of but it didn't matter because we ended up skating there anyway and nothing went down.  This just comes to show that laughter can bring us all together at any giving moment. No matter the skin color or were your from you can always be funny. Some people my be funnier than others but everyone has a sense of humor within them. You can always find the time to make a joke or come up with a clever hilarious line for some one to laugh there brains out at. Laughter is the one thing you can count on in an awkward position or when you go to a new school or have never been somewhere before. Laughter can always keep you out of fights no matter what. All around the world people are laughing at this very moment and bonding by it. It is the sign of happiness and gratefulness. Laughter has a purpose and will never disappear.Laughter is bonding.

20841,8," As we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize that we cant live without it. Its one of those things that are always going to be with us through tough times, and the joy of life. So when people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", well there right! You can think anything you want to, but i want you to know that i have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy i have fallen for.  It all started on a softball tournament in bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the @LOCATION2 inn hotel. Which was very nice by the way, probably to nice for our team, because we end up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room, hence the hard practices. After our practice we go ahead and swim in the pool, even know we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two big pools, one outside, and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the inside pool because in was way to cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @PERSON3 and I go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while two boys about our age enter the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us which was kind of awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys I'm not shy to just speak my mind and to ask them why the hell there just sitting there pretending to mind there own business, and i know for a fact that's not why. We talk a laugh for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable and i hit it off with him very well. It got later into the @TIME1 and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say good bye for ever. Me and @PERSON3 shared a room with her parents. I had know idea that @PERSON3 gave my number to @PERSON1, the guy i kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later i get a text saying ""meet me outside to walk around"". So i amused that it was him, and i got all excited! so we snuck out of the room for the @TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefooted and as cute as can be. I never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like i could con-core everything that came my way.  About forty five minutes past, still gazing into each others eyes, feeling like it as only been a second. His friend @PERSON2 sees someone walking out a the hotel room and realizes that its his mom. They bolt off saying there goodbyes and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life have i experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all i understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that i would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in @CAPS1 and i live in @LOCATION1. How could anything possibly happen between us? Maybe some day i will meet him again. Maybe someday i would be able to talk to him again like we did that @TIME1, and just maybe, will i fall in love with him. All those maybe's have came true, because i fallowed what was right and i waited. Now sense that all happened i can ponder and relate to laughter and how it effected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quick in my young life.",17.0,16.0,,33.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20842,8," I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me.""  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along.",21.0,14.0,40.0,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20844,8," I'm a tell you about moments sometimes even adventures with a boy named @CAPS1.C. @CAPS4 has brown hair that is up to his neck, that @CAPS4 loves to swoosh around like in the movies. @CAPS4 most definitely doesn't like his bangs cut to short other wise the swoosh will not turn out the same way. @CAPS4 has brown eyes that just seem to sparkle and a smile that seems to fool everyone. ""@CAPS2, @CAPS4's so adorable"", they say.""@CAPS2, @CAPS4 so cute"", they say.@CAPS1.C is cute, but does things that will amaze you! Things you wouldn't think a kid his age could make possible. Like i always say, ""@CAPS4'll make you work for your money!""The thing is @CAPS4's only @NUM1 years of age, well right now @CAPS17. @CAPS4 loves the attention, @CAPS4'll do almost anything for it. Yet @CAPS4's very lovable and sometimes sweet.@CAPS4 loves comedy, cartoons, candy, video games, the works. @CAPS1.C is lots of fun believe me when i say you'll never get bored! I think when @CAPS4 was @NUM2 1/@NUM2 when the adventures began. @CAPS4 would always go in the refrigerator and just @CAPS8 at the egg cartons and double check if anyone was around. Then @CAPS4'd grab one and toss it and say, ""@CAPS5, chicken?"" with a baby type accent, so adorable! but @CAPS4'd try another and another and another until all the eggs were splattered all over the place. @CAPS4'd run off knowing we're coming to close to him and hide. I must admit i didn't know who was doing all this at first. I kind of thought it was @CAPS1.C, but wasn't too sure. That was only one mischief.@CAPS4 also loved this aquarium that was there, very bright because of the light it just seem to attract him. @CAPS4'd get closer and closer and just @CAPS8 at the fishes. Watching them swim, all the different pretty colors. The rocks and the little toys seemed to attract him more. When @CAPS5 one was around @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 above the tank and stick his hand in very carefully and say,""@CAPS7!""trying to attempt to grab it, but @CAPS5 success. When @CAPS4 heard that someone was coming or getting closer to him @CAPS4'd run so fast like the bird cartoon from loony toons always out smarting the coyote. There would be a mess, of course. Though everyone knew @CAPS4'd be trouble once @CAPS4'd start walking! @CAPS4 was so cute though.Now when @CAPS4 was between the ages @NUM4 and @NUM5, @CAPS4 just loved picking at people just for the fun of it, or so we thought. @CAPS4 do it for the attention so we'd go drop what were doing and go run after him. What @CAPS4'd do was grab something that was valuable to a certain person and go up to them and say, ""@CAPS8! me have, me have.""Of course, we had to go run after him, but sometimes you'd have to be careful because if not @CAPS4'd toss if and wham! It would brake. there's only a few things I'm pointing out here, but in reality there was much more and it was ore exciting then might be explaining it! age @NUM5 was a workout! One day we decide to lend @CAPS1.C our @CAPS10 touch to entertain him because we were busy doing our own things and @CAPS1.C discovers you tube! @CAPS4 loves this show called @CAPS12 and @CAPS13! In other words @CAPS4 calls it, ""@CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS16.""@CAPS17 @CAPS4'd go on it and watch most of the t.v shows on the @CAPS10 touch and use the apps on it! @CAPS4 is very smart when it comes to using electronics if i @MONTH1 add. The day after that @CAPS4'd ask for the @CAPS10 touch almost frequently then every time @CAPS4 was denied of using it, @CAPS4'd go to his methods in getting it! Of course what @CAPS4 did was, when lights were out and everyone was asleep @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 all over, when finally @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 under the pillows and grab them and take it with him. The very next morning we were after him! @CAPS4 told us, but yet again @CAPS4 would do it! Then we went to drastic measures we hid the @CAPS10 touches else where. now at @NUM1 years of age! whoa, well @CAPS5 in my opinion I think @CAPS4 calmed down a little more. Others @MONTH1 not think so, but i know so! Anyways @CAPS4 is now @NUM1 which means @CAPS4 is now starting school! which i hear is quite entertaining for those who are not involved! They love @CAPS1.C but sometimes @CAPS4 can be a little too much, ha. @CAPS4 loves roaming around doing what @CAPS4 loves most and just having a great time, which i admire. well if i were to say one little short story about him as a @NUM1 year old I'd pick, how @CAPS5 matter what @CAPS4'd always defend his brothers! @CAPS4 wont let @CAPS5 one bully his brothers, @CAPS5 matter what the odds! i admire most about him is that!",15.0,16.0,30.0,30.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20846,8," Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It is to become amused or derisive. Many people today make jokes or funny remarks just to hear somebody laugh. It is never something we should take for granted. Through many relationships no matter what kind, I believe laughter takes up at least @PERCENT1 of your relationship. It's to show the best out of someone and to let them know you are listening. There are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter. ""I'm sure you can even think of one"".  In my views of this world and our society today, I believe laughter is what makes up our ""human"" spirit. It's to show ourselves and other people the spark we have inside us. Have you ever sat and pondered why we make each other laugh? I have asked myself this same question over and over. For me making people laugh is letting them know I care and to also think I'm funny as well. We even do it just the fact of wanting people to like us better and to be known as funny, hilarious, or just a good person to talk to. Sometimes we can go to the extremes of being to funny, and feeling guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way.  I remember in the eighth grade, I was thirteen years old. I was really shy and didn't have much friends. One day in class some of the popular kids actually came over and started talking to me. I was @CAPS1 excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me. Of course they were laughing and making jokes, not caring what anyone else was saying. Then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend it made me angry but happy at the same time, because some of the things she was saying were true. That's were I messed up, I started talking about all the other dumb things she did, just to make everybody else laugh. As I was sitting there all I felt was guilt and disappointment in myself. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking about my best friend, just to try and make myself popular. Later that day she came up to me really upset and couldn't understand why I would do that to her. I told her I was sorry and that I only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids. We didn't talk for almost two weeks. @CAPS1 I tried to do everything in my own possible way to get my best friend back. It did take me awhile, but she finally came around and forgave me. It was a good life lesson for me, knowing laughter @MONTH1 not always be a good thing. Now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day. We both together can share a laugh. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can bring somebody up and tear them down. I have experienced these things as well in my life time. Laughter has made me stronger and to be a better person, even if it means turning down popular kids @CAPS1 you don't hurt those closest to you.""@CAPS1 go out and make somebody laugh today"".",20.0,18.0,34.0,34.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4,3,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20847,8," Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh everyday. People wouldn't be the same without laughter, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS2. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to @MONTH1 of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS2. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class. This was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time.",15.0,20.0,,35.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20848,8," Laughter is something everyone needs in their life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile and a sense of humor to live life to it's fullest. When people take things other have said, differently, or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh, and they take it the wrong way. People told me, ""you need a sense of humor, you know?"" @CAPS1, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time. With friends, and family becoming more and more apart from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was coming to a close, I realized there was more to life @CAPS1 moping around in my own self-pity. It was getting close to @DATE1 vacation and I know I wanted to make @DATE1, and my junior year, my year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After from being all sad and not having any fun, and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me, I know I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had more laughs @CAPS1 I couldn't even remember having. It was a really good memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem was getting a lot better @CAPS1 it use to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life @CAPS1 getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans-gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS2-book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON2, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME1, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, in @LOCATION1. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON1, was singing to the songs by @CAPS5, while @PERSON2 mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 light up with a smile.",15.0,15.0,,30.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20849,8," In a relationship you should be able to trust in each other, confide in each other, talk with each other, cry with each other and most importantly laugh with each other. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I can definitely agree with that statement. The relationship in my life that I totally get the most laughter out of is the relationship between me and my best friend, and boyfriend, @PERSON2. He can always make me laugh, even on my worst days he can find a smile and a little giggle. I constantly thank @CAPS1 for putting him in my life.  The first thing that I really noticed about @PERSON2 when I started to get to know him better, is that he can always make me laugh. Whether he is making totally weird faces at me or tickling me until I can barely breath, he always knows how to get me laughing. When I am balling my eyes out to him, even then he can get me to giggle. Just @TIME1 I had had a terrible day at school and within a few minutes of me crying to him, he had cheered me up and got me to laugh. In church or with friends we will just look at each other and make a face and start laughing, there's something about those blue eyes and that dorky smile that will always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh with each other has been a great aspect of our relationship since the beginning. When we play @CAPS2, or he plays and I fail at attempting to play, we always laugh at how bad I am at it, or when I finally do get an awesome kill. ""That just works out, don't it!"" is one of our inside jokes, obviously it's not all that funny but we have fun competing at who can say it the most in one day. The rule is you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always playfully argue over who won or gets ""the point"" (as if we actually keep score) but that usually gets us laughing at some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us tries to use. When ever there is a camera around @PERSON2 likes to make funny faces, which will always get me laughing. Then we usually end up taking somewhere around twenty silly pictures and just going through them and laughing and laughing at all of the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing it usually gets the other one laughing too, they do say laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable with and around each other you have to be able to laugh at your self. One time, @PERSON2 his little sisters, @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 and I were all seeing how high we could kick and long story short I kneed myself in the forehead, @PERSON2 was the only one who noticed or heard the crack of my bones hitting each other with force, and he just got silent until I started cracking up. Then he made sure I was okay. We were laughing so hard we cried and I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks were bright red from embarrassment too, but I just laughed it off. Another time we were goofing around on the hard wood floor at his house and I pushed him to the ground, his whole family was cracking up and his face was bright red, but he just laughed it off. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other we both have the ability to laugh it off.  Even when things get rough our you disagree on something it is always good to later be able to look back on it and laugh about it with each other. Just because @PERSON2 and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, we actually disagree about a lot of things most are small but once in a while we will disagree on something a little bigger. At times one of us will do or say something that upsets the other one, we are always able to work it out and later look back on it and laugh even when it is a touchy subject. Both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh.  Obviously I have reason too agree with the statement ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" because I have that connection in the best way possible. I am so thankful to have @PERSON2 in my life, his ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place. So between ""@CAPS3"" over a text message, cracking up at weird things we do or just watching a movie, we are always laughing at each other or with each other. As we both would put it ""were freaking soul mates!""",21.0,23.0,,44.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,":**

20850,8," Every day I spend with my girlfriend is a day full of fun and laughter. I can be in the worst of moods and she can brighten my whole day with @CAPS1 a couple of words. Together we can chane any situation into a happy one. What i'm trying to say is that laughter is a very powerful thing @CAPS1 by making someone laugh, you can change their mood, their day or in some cases maybe change their whole life. People say that laughter is very contagous. I beleive that is true. Take comedians for example, they can take any situation and make a whole room burst with laughter. My favorite one is when this one comedian said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 shivering in the cold, we will bring him silver and gold"", like the song. He then said "" @CAPS4 don't they @CAPS1 bring him some blankets, I meen come on, the poor kid is going to die of hypothermia but at least he will be rich when he does"". I wrote this paper to show how powerful laughter is in the world. I beleive that everyone should laugh at least once a day to make the world a brighter place.   I conclude with this "" A smile can light up a room but laughter can change the world into a happier place"". Nobody should go through life without laughter. "" A life without laughter is a life not spent"".",16.0,15.0,,31.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,2,,":**

20851,8,"A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago @CAPS4 I meet my friend @CAPS1. I meet her at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION5's @CAPS4, @CAPS1 was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both mad at each other and just saying, ""@CAPS3 watch where your going!"" @CAPS4 we both calmed down we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION3 line. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for awhile, until I apologized for running into her earlier. She said, ""@CAPS5 its @CAPS6, I should of been watching where I was going other then watching the floor, as I walk."" We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food. After we payed, I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS1 goes to a private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6. I have told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both loved band. @CAPS1 and I have just noticed that we have meet before once at a band competition. We have bumped into each other before the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down. I was just walking, just like @CAPS1 was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION1, I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad each other as well. We both just laughed for awhile just laughing how we did the same thing, but the other way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone you can tell if you well be good friends or not. Laughter is a big deal in friendship. I mean whats the point of having a friend @CAPS4 you don't even have laughter once in awhile and have awesome memories with each other. I still hang out with @CAPS1 until this very day and we still can't believe that we meet twice in the same way.",15.0,17.0,,32.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20852,8," Laughter is a very important part of life, for many different reasons. Some @MONTH1 say that its vital to survive, one needs laughter to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps. This is a statement I myself believe, and have concluded from the actions and outcomes in my life. Laughter can show emotions towards a statement, or lack of emotions. Laughter can make someone either depressed or happy. It is true when someone says there is a difference when someone is laughing at you, as opposed to someone laughing with you. When a friend or a group of friends laugh with me, its an amazing, self esteem raising emotion. This laughter brings friends closer, and causes us to trust each other more. One time I thought laughing was appropriate at the time but then later felt awful. One scorching @DATE1 day my friends and I decided to venture to the mall, being we lived in apartments and lacked the money for an air conditioner. We all agreed it was a splendid idea. When we reached the mall we were relieved by the cool breeze as the doors swung open, as if to greet us. All of us are very introverted so shopping around in an over crowded mall wasn't our cup of tea. Not knowing what to @CAPS1 we sat on a bench and did what we call people watching. Their was this girl, I will always remember her; @CAPS4 was one of those girls you peer at just for a minute and you know @CAPS4 was rich. A sort of stuck up girl, a walk where @CAPS4 means to exaggerate her hips and bounce her perfect bleach blond hair.  The girl passed by us and stuck her nose in the air as if we were not even remotely good enough to be in her presence. Quite a bit angry I stood up after @CAPS4 strolled past and mocked her strut. My friends found this hysterical. Roars of laughter leaped from their mouths. The pressy girl stopped proceeding forward and then started approaching us. @CAPS4 grimaces at us all snobby-like and says, ""@CAPS1 you guys like have a problem or something?"" @CAPS2 covered my face, I didn't know what to say. Fortunately my best friend stepped in and said, ""@CAPS3, we think your dress is very pretty."" @CAPS4 believed us, then walked off, in a rather less snobby sort of way.  Through this weird and interesting experience my friends and I learned a lot. One, people can hear you talking crap about them from a mile away. Two, laughter can bring friends together, but can also have some consequences. I @CAPS1 not know for sure if @CAPS4 did hear or see us mocking her. But I knew inside I felt a little bad. Sure laughing at her in the time felt right, amusing. Looking back on it, I feel awful. I have been in that same situation but on the receiving end. It is not pleasant having people talking crap about you behind your back and laughing uncontrollably. Laughing is very vital to life but needs to be appropriate.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

Lift heavy spirts to new heights, and it can also create great devotion, to a person, thing or cause. So what has laughter done for you and I? Well it has done lots for me, a good example would be my experience in the @ORGANIZATION2.  At @CAPS2 middle @ORGANIZATION3 I had everything going for me. I had good grades, teachers, but most of all a group of friends that I could share many laughs with. When we graduated and went to @ORGANIZATION3 my friends either moved or dispersed into other groups. It was horrible not to have anyone to laugh with, making things pretty tough. Then came the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program, or @ORGANIZATION1.  Since I wasn't really envoled in the program I didn't have any friends, save vanecek. Then an opportunity it join the @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4 arose, I took it. Every afternoon for one hour we had practice, which in turn created a strong bond between the @ORGANIZATION4 members. Before shooting we would laugh it up and relax, making it a fun enviroment to shoot. The @ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, @CAPS4 @CAPS1, due to all the laughter heard outside the range. The @ORGANIZATION2, which my battalion as a part of, hosts five competitions a year. With fourteen schools from across @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2 competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition we had been with one another long enough to consider one another family. My family, seeing how I was nervous, took me aside the night before the shoot-out. We played cards, talked and cracked jokes, it was the one of the most special times of my life. We shot early the next morning, I wasn't nervous just relaxed. Out of twenty four man teams we took third, not bad for a new famliy. Since then the @ORGANIZATION4 has taken first, four times in a row. Those victories I have to give credit to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter in a way has inspired me to devote myself to a family, and has taken me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @CAPS4 @CAPS1 are you part of?",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20857,8," Seeing one of @CAPS15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door, was enough to make myself laugh. Its was the @DATE1 after @CAPS15 @NUM1 grade year of school. I was having @CAPS15 friends @PERSON2, @PERSON3 and @CAPS15 neighbor @PERSON1 stay the night at @CAPS15 house. @CAPS25 ever we got bored we usually went around @CAPS15 neighborhood ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"" some houses to have some fun. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"" is @CAPS25 @CAPS21 quietly sneak up to someones front door, ring the door bell a couple times and then @CAPS23 run away. All four of us were hanging out that day. It was a great @DATE1 day, gorgeous sun, warm temperature and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face.@CAPS25 it came to night fall we were all in @CAPS15 room playing @CAPS7 @NUM2.  ""I'm bored bro,"" @PERSON2 said to the other three of us.  ""@CAPS8 then, think of something to @CAPS19,""@CAPS9 replied  ""I can't think of anything,"" @PERSON1 stated with a bored look on his face. We sat for a while thinking of something to @CAPS19 to entertain the four of us. ""I got it!"" I said with a confident smirk ,""lets go @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!"" "" I down for that ,""@PERSON2 said ""@CAPS13 me too ,""@CAPS9 and @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2. As we were walking out @CAPS15 front door @CAPS15 mom shouted ,""where are @CAPS21 boys going?"" @CAPS15 mom caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say ,""uh, we are going on a walk ,""I replied hesitantly.  ""@CAPS16 be safe,"" @CAPS15 mom said as I walked out of the door. We @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ditched a couple house, but that was starting to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I have thought of yet.  ""@CAPS18 this is what needs to happen, I'm going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28 the first house, @PERSON2 @CAPS21 get the next one, @PERSON1 @CAPS21 get the house at the corner and @PERSON3 will run around the corner to get the last house.   ""@CAPS19 @CAPS21 think that will work?"" @PERSON1 asked.  ""@CAPS20 yes it will work!"" I said,""@CAPS21 @CAPS18 ready?""   ""I guess so ,"" @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the first door bell and started running, then I saw @PERSON2 slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see @PERSON1 ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me.  ""@CAPS9 get the last house!"" I shouted at him. The house @CAPS9 was running to did not have their porch light on. @CAPS9 was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS9 tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,""should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?""  ""@CAPS23 run @CAPS9 I'm sure they would hear @CAPS21 smack their screen door with your face!"" @CAPS25 we got back to @CAPS15 house everyone was laughing. @CAPS9 @CAPS23 made our night. That happened @NUM3 years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So next time one of your friends ask @CAPS21 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28"" a house think about if the porch lights are on.

20859,8," ""@CAPS1 ma, do you know where my purse is."" I wonder where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and figured it would be just another day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing our rivals, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The day was going by slow though, I couldn't wait until it was over. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they didn't go I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2.  This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION1 (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us. We just started laughing it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else and I said no, my car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dieing. Out of all the other days my car decided not to start, today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car I got so embarrassed and starting laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more, I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did, I was so relieved and embarrassed, I left as soon as I could.  Twenty minutes later we were in @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to, I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began and just how I figured, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at players, shouting at the referee, and just being annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won by @CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION1 did have a good team.   After the game we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I new but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON2 told me to keep going she new where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by @CAPS7. I got onto one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION2. The road I was on had a million stop lights though, and I was stopping every @NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he wasn't even on a crosswalk. I kept going no worries on my mind, music blasting, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't get any worse, I pulled over and waited for the @CAPS8 to come up to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves got to me I couldn't help it. I looked everywhere finally he asked if I had my school I.D, I went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me bursting with laughter. He came back and told me my insurance was expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it as a joke. You cant control nerves though, or at least I can't.",20.0,23.0,,43.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20860,8,"                     Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear.",20.0,18.0,36.0,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20861,8,"                     Laughter Laughter has always played a significant role in the relationships of @CAPS2 life. Being able to laugh with someone creates a bond with that person.Through laughter, I was able to become friends with a person that I can call to this day @CAPS2 best friend. I met the person that would later on become @CAPS2 best friend through one of @CAPS2 friends. A few friends of mine and I were hanging out and @CAPS2 friend, @PERSON1, said, "" @CAPS1 know @PERSON2, @CAPS1 should talk to a good friend of mine.""I didn'@CAPS4 oppose to the idea because from what @PERSON1 told me about her, it seemed like it would be very easy for me to get along with her. About ten minutes later, I looked down at @CAPS2 cell phone and noticed that I had a text message from a number that I did not know. I asked who the person was and waited for a response. Two minutes pass by and I get a message that says, ""@CAPS2 name is @ORGANIZATION2. I am the girl the curly-headed kid sitting next to @CAPS1 told @CAPS1 about."" Once I read this I started just about busted up into a fit of laughter. Never would I have thought a girl I had never spoken to would be brave enough,or sarcastic enough, to say something like that as the first thing they would say to me. For the next few hours, we kept exchanging sarcastic remarks and jokes and the laughs just kept on coming. @ORGANIZATION2 is the type of person that can make anyone laugh. This is what I love about her; @CAPS3 possesses a talent of making anyone laugh no matter where they are, what kind of mood they are in, or what they are doing. We have walked around for hours and we have spent a majority of that time having to stop and catch our breath because we had been laughing so hard. Our ability to laugh with each other has helped us through difficult times in our lives. @ORGANIZATION2's mom passed away a few years ago and this sent her into a depressive state. @CAPS3 rarely felt any happiness until we would talk. Our ability to start laughing at one another helped her throughout this time. I recently received a @CAPS4.B.I. or @ORGANIZATION1. I felt numb to the world. Nothing felt the way that it once felt. Luckily for me, @ORGANIZATION2 was able to come in and do what I had done for her; @CAPS3 was able to make me laugh and feel normal again. Having the ability to laugh with @ORGANIZATION2 has definitely made our friendship stronger than it would have been had we not been able to laugh together. Being able to laugh doesn'@CAPS4 just effect that one moment in time, nor does it just impact one person. Having laughter means so much more than that. Being able to laugh creates bonds that are simply not possible without laughter. I have felt what laughter can do to a relationship and I can say that it most definitely feels good.",19.0,20.0,40.0,40.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20862,8," ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 society today loves laughter. From comical shows to hilarious friends, people have fun convulsing with glee. Not to mention that when you're doubled over with laughter you are getting an amazing workout. Everyone that texts @MONTH1 use ""@CAPS3"" or ""haha"" to show they think something is funny; but it is nothing compared to actually being with friends and having, ""a smile that burst.""  I couldn't wait. I was on the coast at a camp with my friends, and we were about to head-up to walk up to the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. One of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter. Because when she tripped, she barely caught herself, as she was about to fall on sleeping @CAPS4. Jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us. After the door was closed, we all doubled over laughing. Jasmine's face, when she tripped was priceless.  We headed into the crisp air without looking back. From a gravel path to the cement road going up the hill, we happily skipped along. As the hill got steeper, we started walking. Jasmine, after being tired from skipping, almost fell again. Everyone started laughing again. The walk up the hill was taking longer than expected. Finally, we could see the three crosses at the top.  When we arrived at the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. We kept staring at the ocean; waiting with anticipation. Eventually, @CAPS5 pointed out that the sun rises on the east and would we coming over the mountains. Again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun rose on. At last, the astonishing sunrise happened. It was full of pink, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill. I peered over the edge and saw a little path. With a bunch of convincing, I got all the girls to walk down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up.  The first part of the path was simple. As we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush. A couple of the girls thought we should head back up, but I convinced them otherwise. So on we went. ""@CAPS6 no!"" @CAPS7 yelled. We turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush. She had just gotten her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. Everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far away. Suddenly, @PERSON1 tried to grab the shoe; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! @PERSON2 forgot about her shoe for a little and started doubled over with laughter again. While flailing and screaming we yelled for her to stop because if I didn't mention this earlier; this is a very steep hill. While she was in the bush, she grabbed @PERSON2's shoe. The hard part was getting @PERSON1 out.  The first time we tried to pull her up; we got her up a couple of inches then she fell back down, into the bush. Finally, after what felt like a million tries, we pulled her big butt out of the bush. Everyone was laughing so hard during the extravaganza. @PERSON1 was super embarrassed. After all of that, we headed down the hill. We still had giggles while trotting down the trail. As we went, we saw animal tracks. We then realized the trail was most likely made by animal. A couple girls joked around about being terrified of the animal tracks. Eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing about what had taken place. The rest of the day everyone was happy and giggly for waking up with an amazing morning.  Laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. Laughter helped us work through the mud, the shoe losing, and the cold. With out it, we could have been very grumpy. Also, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. Laughing helps people be happy; being happy is better than being sad; therefore, laughter is important. When writing this paper to the @ORGANIZATION1's in @LOCATION1, I told my friends about the adventure we went on and the predicament we got ourselves into. They laughed hysterically, since they knew the girls. Laugh often to be happy.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20863,8," ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1. Wow! All those great times last @DATE1 and all the ones to come. Some people think were weird but if you knew us you would understand. Sometimes people say, ""I'm going to die laughing."" @CAPS2 i know I am because of @PERSON1, she knows how to always make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we've laughed about or done together i could there isn't enough time or numbers to tell you how many times.  First of all, this friendship started the @DATE1, and now we are in sophomore @DATE1 of high school. We've been friends for one @DATE1 and eleven months and six days. We are the best of best of friends.  So last @DATE1 when we were learning the cheers for football season, all most every-time we got done with a cheer, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I would say, ""@CAPS3-in @CAPS4."" That was our saying, and we always did it @DATE1 and after the football or basketball games. We called it our @CAPS3-in @CAPS4 style or for short our slogan. We would be having a blast and laughing for hours.  ""@CAPS5 turn, @CAPS6 turn,"" In @DATE2 we were on our way to state for cheer. On the car ride up to @LOCATION1, every-time we took a corner we would say what corner it was and do a motion with it. Oh @CAPS1 goodness we laughed and we had a blast. After the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 turns, there was another motion we called the monkey and we would act like monkeys. It was so much fun we laughed. We also laughed so hard that we were crying and we had to go pee so bad, it was almost really bad.That was one of many car rides that was amazing.  On the other hand, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I, cheer together, we have sleepovers, @CAPS2 i should say that we do everything together. She is @CAPS1 cheer sister and will always be, also she is @CAPS1 best friend.I would do anything for her. I love @PERSON1 @PERSON1.  In addition, to the we do everything together. When @PERSON1 is over at @CAPS1 house I always have to make sure I make sandwiches and orange juice. Because this one time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so i went and made all of that and @PERSON1 loved it so now i have to make sure i have some for her when she comes over. Now we always talk about the becomes of the sandwich habit.b we laugh about it all the time.  Finally, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I are going to be together forever, because i don't know what i would do with out @CAPS1 sister. I would not be the person who I am today with out her she and everything to me we laugh even when we want to cry she is everthing to me. You could say we have a perfect freindship of all time. @CAPS1 bestfriend is @CAPS1 sister I love you @PERSON1, thanks for alays having @CAPS1 back.

20865,8," It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy.",20.0,18.0,,38.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20866,8," It was one of those days where I just sat around all day doing nothing, but play @PERSON2, text, and laugh at myself. It was one of those days where no one bothered me; no one even really talked to me; no one told me to do chores. By dinner time someone decided to call me up stairs to eat, but let me tell you, it wasn't anything like pizza. Although I'd rather eat it than get a lecture on not being thankful. My brother came home for the first time in ever, ate with us, then decided to leave again. But this time I asked to come with; I'm so tired of beating @PERSON2. He said no, of coarse. I made my daddy change his mind for him, of coarse. I don't see why he wouldn't let me come in the first place. He was going to hang out with the guys I grew up with, my friends, not his. Anyways. I got ready then we hit the road. There him and I were, laughing about dinner and what kind of music my mom listens to, on our way to pick up my friends. These guys are great! All we do is crack jokes about each other and crack up. But let's get down to business. I didn't tell you this, but it's @DATE1 time, around The @CAPS1 of @DATE2. Fireworks are for sale and we're creating ""bombs"" out of them. Or they are. Since I'm a girl, I guess I'm not allowed, or something lame like that. But there is this girl my brother likes and I guess he wants to impress, excuse me ""impress"" her by showing up at her house so she can see these ""master pieces"" they've made. That just makes me feel bad for him, but honestly just made me laugh. Maybe she'll be impressed. Key word: maybe. Although, no, it won't. Because to this day they are still only friends.  So about these bombs. Complete duds. We tried, well I just watched, over and over again to make 'em work, but they wouldn't do a thing. Eventually my friend @CAPS2 put a whole bunch of @CAPS3 @CAPS4's into my favorite stuffed animal. It just made a bunch of sparkly colors and loud noises, but it was pretty fun to watch. We got in on video too, it was a total good laugh for everyone. After my brother said goodbye to his ""girl,"" we decided to head home. The thing is, we had so many fireworks left! We know this kid @PERSON3 who lives somewhere on the way home. So we decided to go by his house, have @CAPS2 get out of the truck, light the firework on his porch, have him jump in the tail of the trunk, then drive off as fast as we could. The first time we did it we couldn't stop laughing. They didn't come out of their house, so we did it again. They still didn't come out. We did it about one more time, by then all the neighbors were out. They were all so confused. That just made us laugh even more. It was so great we wanted to keep doing it, but to someone else this time. We know this girl @PERSON1 who lives near all of us. We thought, why not? It's not gonna hurt to stop there real quick and have some fun with her too. Apparently she thought different. Way different, actually she thought it was the rudest thing ever. We were just joking around, gettin' a laugh out of all our fun. We weren't being rude, she's our friend. Long story short, her mom got mad too and chased us down in her car. She never caught us, but she got our license plate number. The next day, on The @CAPS1 of @DATE2, she called the police. They didn't think it was a big deal, but they still showed up at my house and talked to my parents about what went down. I was at my boyfriend's so lucky me I only had to talk to my mom on the phone about it. She realized we were just having fun and actually laughed about it too. That @CAPS1 of @DATE2 @CAPS8 was great. It was one of those nights where you laughed the whole time and wouldn't change a thing even if you got in trouble with the law for it. Something I will definitely never do again, but I'm so glad I have this hilarious memory to reminisce on for the rest of my life.",20.0,17.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the old days made them all want to hangout more often. They always had @CAPS2 much fun together. I grew up with my cousins around a lot of the time. We would always hangout. We started talking about all the crazy times we have had, and it was nice to hear abut the old days. We were just laughing up a storm. All a sudden out of @CAPS1 where my cousin @PERSON1 farts. All of us start busting up laughing. @PERSON1 continues to fart while she is uncontrollably laughing. @CAPS2 many people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here was a group of people all laughing, and one of them cannot stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting. my mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table. She wanted to drowned out the sound of @LOCATION1's farts. @PERSON1 was beat red. We were all laughing @CAPS2 hard we started crying. We were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves. @PERSON1 could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @CAPS2 bad she could not even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom she had to walked there cross legged, and very slowing. All the way there she was still laughing, and we were also laughing. We had fun watching her have to stop every @CAPS2 often @CAPS2 she would not pee on herself. One time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs. She just stood there laughing cross legged over these two guys trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom ""I would be uncomfortable to if i had some random girl bent over me laughing, and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. i would have"".  Finally @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her we could not help but laugh. She laughed with us @CAPS2 we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go @CAPS2 we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play bored games. When we got home my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is kinda like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brothers team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shout out ""wicked witch of the west""! He frowns at me and says, ""@CAPS1, watch before you shout things out."" @CAPS2 i sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again,but when he got to the floor he started rolling and jerking around. I was @CAPS2 confused. My cousins shouts out ""poop""! My brother yells ""@CAPS3, why would anyone want to be poop""! We all start laughing,and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and i got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making sound. I went up there and started hoping around like and idiot. I felt @CAPS2 dumb. My team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them. The buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad, and ran up the stairs. On his way up there he trips on his face, and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of the @TIME1.  The rest of us stayed downstairs, and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hangout with the family, and get a great laugh. hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good.

20870,8," Laughter is important, we all know that. It makes life easier, happier and even helps you live longer. It's also very important to relationships. When talking about preference in significant others it's often that people mention that they want someone who can make them laugh, this is why. this story is , however, not about dating. It is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next.  I had known @PERSON1 for a while for a few months at this point, I had met him on the bus. He was pale, skinny, loud, and he always had something funny and offensive to say. He was a shut in. Before I met @PERSON1 I could dish it out but I couldn't take it. I remember one day, the day I went from hating him to befriending him, we were fighting about something so insignificant that I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Although I do remember what he said. He said that I was a ""hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would go around making fun jokes at other peoples expense but would get up in someones face if they tried one at me."" this made me laugh. Not because everything he said was right but because it made me realise that @PERSON1 was actually a pretty good guy whose only real problem was that he didn't know when to shut up. Throughout the whole time I have known @PERSON1 he has never stopped smiling. He laughs off everything from stepping in dog crap to his fathers drug addiction he can dull the pain of any blow with laughter. @PERSON1 is my constant reminder to never stof laughing.",16.0,15.0,,31.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"The `response.text` quick accessor only works when the response contains a valid `Part`, but none was returned.

20872,8,"Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have been there, I know @CAPS4 have. We all have. @CAPS4 have been that kid that just did not feel like helping your nagging parent out. Especially when your dad had been in a huge motorcycle wreck and @CAPS4 had been waiting on him hand and foot the entire visit there.@CAPS10 had gone through a couple of surgeries and was put on a lot of medications for @CAPS2. I had noticed @CAPS10 was not really himself on all these pills. His abnormality was taking a toll on the family. Through all these stressful times, we were also worried about @CAPS6 stepmother. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also stress of having @CAPS6 fathers business being the main income, and him not being able to work. @CAPS6 father felt helpless, his leg was to weak for him to be doing anything.@CAPS10 would micromanage everything, and tell @CAPS4 were doing things all wrong. The was starting to cause a lot of tension within the house.  Today was the day. Isabelle (@CAPS6 little sister) and I were left alone with @CAPS6 with dad for the first time.I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in @CAPS6 room. Father asked asked if I could make him some oatmeal, of course with full hands I said ""@CAPS5, but I will when I'm done."" @CAPS6 father took that as disrespect, and hobbled over to me with his crutches. @CAPS10 was yelling at me which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back i headed to @CAPS6 room.The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and headed back to @CAPS6 room. That's when it happened. @CAPS6 father hooked the end of a little kids chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, putting a hole in the wall, and hitting @CAPS6 knee. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next. Slamming the door luckily I had the phone and I called @CAPS6 grandmother. I told her on a voice mail that I wanted her to pick me up and take me to her house. She showed up an hour or so later not knowing I left a voice mail. I explained what happened, and she comforted @CAPS6 sister and I telling us it would be okay. @CAPS6 grandmother sat us all in the living room to try and resolve the situation. By then @CAPS6 dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. @CAPS10 used popcorn and candy to make us forgive him, then @CAPS10 started making fun, and jokes. Every time there is a fight or disagreeing @CAPS6 dad always cracks a few jokes to get us in a better mood. The one thing different this time is after @CAPS10 told some jokes, @CAPS10 apologized again. This time explaining why @CAPS10 was sorry. I liked that which made the rest of the day quite a joy.  "" @CAPS7 made laughter to be a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 medicine, @NUM1 minutes of laughter is equal to two hours of @CAPS2 @CAPS3."" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a @DATE1 service talked about this. Laughter can truly mend a broken heart. The @CAPS2 that @CAPS6 sister an I went through that day was all over after the laughter @CAPS6 father gave us. ""Laughter can save us."" @CAPS10 also stated. After this day I believe with a little humor @CAPS6 father an I's relationship can get through anything. I would never let one mistake control a life time bond. Laughter will always be in our hearts.",20.0,18.0,,38.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,504 Deadline Exceeded
20874,8,"Laughter play's an important role in relationships, @CAPS1 also supports enjoyment and can be a persuit of happinees. Whenever i am laughing its either because i am really enjoying myself or im just having a great time.Many people don't have a very good sense of humor and dont laugh at thing's that are funny, whenever i watch a funny movie's that i like i sit down and wait for the very funny parts, but dont get me wrong, remember not to laugh to hard because you might wet youre pants by accident or who knows if you laugh hard enought you might even pull a ""whotammy ""and trust me that does not look pritty and then you will be embarresed infront of everybody. My favorite comedian is adam sandler because he is very funny and has a good sense of humor, he knows how to keep a person laughting and interested in his comedy shows and movies.when he made the big daddy movie @CAPS1 was pritty good not to funny but @CAPS1 was good.My secound favorite comedian is @PERSON1 because he is funnyer that adam sandler by a lil bit but not quit as good though he also stars on a tv show called wild'n out that show really makes me almost cough out my lungs, especially when they bust out with youre mama jokes @CAPS1 keeps you laughting and keeps the blood pumping thru youre body.so we all pritty much under stand what laughing is but most people dont really seem to laugh at things that are funny i cant quit undersatnd @CAPS1 but my guess is tha t they dont have a good sene of humor but some people seem to lautgh at thing that dont even make sense i quit dont undestand that either but i guess its better to laugh than to not laugh at all. Some really good comedy movies that i can mention out right off the the bat that will keep you tuned and laughing thru more than half off the movies are grandmas boy, happy gillmore, dont be a menace to south central while siping my juice. Also zombie land @CAPS1 is a heck of a good movie, i dont know its not just about making a funny movie just to make the oudience laugh @CAPS1 is the way they make @CAPS1 and how thery act and how good the backround story to the comedy movies is gonna be thats what i pay atencion to when ever i sit down and inspect what makes the movie funny also if i cant understaand a funny movie i see @CAPS1 again and again till i understand what is so hallariouse about @CAPS1.That pritty much covers the basics on laughter there are is youre basic information and what you need to knowabout @CAPS1 and how to enjoy @CAPS1 and use @CAPS1 wisely cause remamber dont laught to hard because you dont want to end up pulling a ""whotammy"" in front off every one that around thank you for reading my test.",15.0,18.0,32.0,32.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

20876,8," Laughter is the cure to a sickness and the medicine to somebodies pain. Laughter can mend a friendship to make two strangers become the best of friends. A person can ask anybody on the street of how much laughter is important in life and they would say that laughter is very important. It's like love, everyone needs a little of it in their life and like laughter, it helps a person grow and become an adult. A person can use laughter to help them with anything like getting a job, or trying to get the girl, or just having a good time and making new friends. It's one of the main elements of life that make a person how they are and what they do. In the @DATE1 I was introduced to a girl named @DATE3, by my cousin @PERSON1. She started talking to me and I was shy because she was a girl and I wasn't used to talking to girls. I cracked a joke and that made her and I laugh together and that was the first icebreaker to making a new friend. The days went by and we were text messaging each other each day over the phone, making jokes about how our day was and making jokes about each other. Eventually we started talking to each other over the phone. Teens these days usually don't use the phone to call people and that makes emotions hard to understand because talking over text hides emotions from one another. @DATE3 called me and we would talk to each other until late in the @TIME1, to where we would both fall asleep and leave the phone on, and again we would always be making jokes about everything. Making each other laugh was one of our only connections with each other since she went to a different school. Making her happy was what I needed to do, and one of the ways to make her happy was to make her laugh or just be a charming young gentlemen because I was raised that way.  @DATE2 formal was coming near and I was in need of a date. @DATE3 was my best option for a date since I was getting close to her and I was starting to get attached to her. When I had the chance I asked her to be my date for the @DATE2 formal which would be one of the most special nights of my freshmen year. The day of the formal came and we danced the @TIME1 away and of course I had to make a few jokes about other things which made everyone laugh and have a good time. Near the end of the dance I asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. She said I was funny, and nice, and cute which was good. We had a fun time because good humor and fun kept the @TIME1 alive. The next @DATE2 formal, the same thing happened with a different girl except that laughter was an important key and that made the @TIME1 so much fun. That @TIME1 was one of the best nights of my life that I had ever had, because we were laughing and having the best @TIME1 ever. Laughter is an important key in my life. I would have never gotten the girl or have had the best @TIME1 of my life if laughter was never involved. Laughter makes everything better and I use it in my everyday life because everybody needs to have a good laugh if they are in a bad mood. Without laughter my life would be dull and have no color that would make me who I am today. It's one of the many keys of life that everyone needs to be happy, and without it you would be less happy then you are right now. A small child could live his whole childhood without laughter or any other important element in his life and he could end up being a mean and cruel person who does not understand good values and humor. Everybody needs personality and color in their life and with out it everything id grey. Life is like a coloring book and without someone or something to color them in with, it's just useless.",17.0,20.0,,37.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20877,8," I have had many great times with my grandpa. He is a very funny and loving man. When my cousin, my grandpa and I get together for a camping trip there is trouble coming no matter what. A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we arrived at had no open sites so we moved on to the next campground. @CAPS1 campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first @TIME1. Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campground. The reason was that there was a racoon problem a few days before and people were scared to stay in the campground for fear of attack or having their food stolen. We were lucky and never saw the racoon and we never lost any of our food.  The next @TIME2 on the way out we saw a sign that read ""caution racoon problem."" @CAPS1 made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, which is a small town on the @ORGANIZATION1. Once in @LOCATION1 we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME1. While at the gas station we had little bit of an issue but it was very funny. A young blond woman came out to help us and she wasn't the smartest person I have met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa is rolling up his window he mutters quite loudly ""dumb blonde"", while the woman was standing right there. She didnt say a word and my gandpa drove off with me and cousin laughing so hard we could barely breath. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what the circumstances were when he said dumb blonde. He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened. The next @TIME1 we stayed at a diiferent campground with no racoons. Still the @TIME1 was filled with laughter. We were roasting marshmellows over the fire after our dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa could not keep the marshmellow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmellow before he even got one that he could eat. And everytime he dropped one into the fire it got more and more funny. We laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt. The best part was theat my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something. In the tent that @TIME1 we were so tired everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME2. Thats when everything went silent and we couldnt last any longer. We were all asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we go closer to each other. My grandpa is a great man and I look up to him for many things in my life. He has always keep me laughing and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with. Keep laughing and have a fun in all you do.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20878,8," ""Laughter"" I believe laughter is the shortest distance between two people. When things between you and a loved one get fuzzy making them laugh will always help break the ice. When I get angry with my boyfriend he knows that in order for me to be happy he must make me smile/laugh. That is exactly what he does. The very first time he made me angry he didn't know what to do. It was @DATE1 @CAPS1 and I had just started dating. I remember he asked me if I was hungry and I said ""no I'm not hungry,"" so he continued to ask. Since we had only been dating for a short period of time he really didn't know much about me, so he didn't know that I am a type of girl that gets annoyed easily and I have a really low temper. He continued to ask me if I was hungry, thirsty, bored, or tired but he didn't realize that at this point I was really annoyed; an hour and a half passed by and he was still asking! I was going crazy I didn't want to tell him how I felt because I knew I was going to make him feel bad, but I thought to myself and said ""no he has to know because its going to be worst if later on in the relationship he has to find out what I like and don't like on his own rather that me telling him. I went on and told him every single little detail about me good and bad, at first he just listened but towards the end he exploded and told me that why wasn't I just straight up with him from the beginning. That made me really upset, I was trying to be honest with him before anything worse happened but i guess not. I stayed quiet for the longest time and he kept asking me ""what's wrong,"" ""tell me what I did wrong"" so I told him that it really made me upset how he flipped out on me for no reason really all I was trying to do was save us from a larger argument, he looked at me and told me that I did do something wrong! He said that we had already been together for two months and it took me that long to show him my true colors I kind of understood where he was coming from but at the same time I didn't agree because by that point he should have already known. I mean it doesn't take that long to know a person especially if its your girlfriend. In the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other. He busted out saying ""ouch charlie you bit me"" in a @CAPS2 accent that just made me loose it I laughed for days after that and completely forgot about thee over whelming discussion we had. The point being here is that laughter is the tool to breaking the ice when things get tough and it doesn't necessarily have to be a loved one it can even be a complete stranger, if the person is shy making them laugh will help construct a great friendship with them. You can make anybody's day go great with just a little grin that you put on their face a simple ""hello"" or ""hey"" can even make them smile. I believe that a person that smiles often lives longer. This @MONTH1 not be true but in my little world it is. I am all about smiling, all about making people laugh. Honestly I hate seeing people walk around with angry faces like if they have no friends when all they really want is someone to make them smile-and that would be me! In conclusion, if it wasn't for laughter what relationship would still be standing at this point? None, because if your always arguing and always wining and never laughing then how do you expect your relationship to last? Like I said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""",17.0,18.0,,35.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,,,"**Ideas and Content**

20879,8,"Angelina @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a year ago, some time in the @DATE2, I was at my best friend @PERSON1's house for a sleepover after her @CAPS3 party. We were exhausted from swimming at her @CAPS4's pool and taking her dog for a walk, not to mention the partying, and we would have been asleep if it weren't for the family-sized bag of @CAPS5 and six pack of @ORGANIZATION1 we'd consumed not an hour before. At around three in the @TIME1, our childish minds searching for something to do, we decided it was a good idea to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish in hopes of them glowing in the dark when held to the black light on her windowsill. I was the first one daring enough to touch my tongue to the brush, and boy did it hurt! The acid and alcohol in the polish stung my taste buds. The next day was @DATE1 and, after hanging out at @LOCATION1's house for the afternoon, we came to my house for another sleepover, which is what we did and sometimes still do every time we are together. That night, this time around two in the @TIME1, we grew hungry again and came downstairs to get a snack before retreating back to my room and @PERSON1 playing on my computer while I used her phone to text my former crush. @PERSON1 got jars or ice water, I still don't know why she uses jars instead of cups, interrupted my spinning around the kitchen floor with my new socks, and we had a random instantaneous ice chugging contest. After ten seconds of silence, I glanced over my jar at @LOCATION1, who wasn't even half done with her water. There, on her chin, was a speck, a dot, a glob, of blue nail polish. I attempted a gasp to give me enough air to start laughing at her, but instead of air coming into my windpipe, and ice cube made its way in. Choking, laughing, falling on the floor, laughing, nail polish-picking, and more laughing, we stood in the middle of the kitchen with nothing to actually laugh at that was that funny. @PERSON1 dropped her jar and it shattered on the floor, sending shards of glass and water across the kitchen, but that's okay. We were having fun, and, guess what, we fell asleep on the kitchen floor not ten minutes later. I suppose we were more tired then we thought. We did clean up the glass though. Some people say laughing is the best medicine a doctor can use, that it can cure any disease, that it can brighten anyone's day. Dentist's apprentices use laughing gas that makes people loopy and smile a lot when they do operations on your teeth, and it doesn't hurt as much, until the day after, but that's because you just had a tooth pulled. Today @PERSON1 and I are still best friends. Sure, we get in fights, but they end within a week or two. The longest fight we were ever in lasted a month and a half, and it was a misunderstood rumor another friend of mine had started, and ended by us both laughing @CAPS2 how stupid whatever happened really was. Within the five or six years of @PERSON1 and I being friends, we realized laughing is healthy and good for you, both physically and emotionally to relieve stress, so every time we see each other we laugh as much as possible. Inside jokes popping up from something said that was totally unrelated, a funny-looking person walking down the side of the road, or just our own minds saying its time to be happy again, it all triggers laughter. Sometimes it hurts, but we cant help laughing harder, because its fun.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The writing is clear and focused.

20881,8,"Once upon a time, on a late rainy night my friends @PERSON2 I decided @CAPS5 would be fun to go out in the woods @PERSON2 play @NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us out to the woods @PERSON2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out @PERSON2 hide @PERSON2 tow would stay in the car @PERSON2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well once while us four were doing that @CAPS5 was pouring down rain @PERSON2 very very muddy outside. Well the two that hide were @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. Before @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 went out to hide we all made up a signal to let the others know if we were okay or no. The danger signal was @CAPS1 @CAPS1. @CAPS3 after we had our little meeting @PERSON2 got everything situated @PERSON2 dealt with, @PERSON1 got out of the car @PERSON2 went of @PERSON2 hid while me @PERSON2 @PERSON3 stayed in the car to wait @PERSON2 count. After we counted to about @NUM2 we hear screaming @PERSON2 shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken @PERSON2 maybe wanted to freak out @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. I was curious @CAPS3 I cracked the car door open @CAPS3 I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came @PERSON1 @PERSON2 rite behind her was @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looked as if @CAPS4 was about to cry @PERSON2 @PERSON2 couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, @CAPS4 kept slipping @PERSON2 sliding everywhere all over on the road but @CAPS4 finally made @CAPS5 back @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 @PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running @PERSON2 screaming from, @CAPS3 me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with @PERSON2 not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from @LOCATION1 jumps out in front of me @PERSON2 says ""right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!"" @CAPS3 I walked over to where @CAPS4 pointed @PERSON2 looked around thinking that @ORGANIZATION1's crazy @PERSON2 @CAPS4's just seeing things. But as I walk on, @PERSON2 grabs me from the back @PERSON2 screams. I turn around @PERSON2 look at her thinking ""what the heck is wrong with you people!"". @CAPS4 grabs me by the arm @PERSON2 looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her @PERSON2 ask her ""whats wrong"" @CAPS4 asks me, ""why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!"" @CAPS5 was dark @PERSON2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON2 was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better @PERSON2 as soon as I make my way back to @PERSON2 by the tree, @ORGANIZATION1 lets out a blood curdling scream @PERSON2 yells ""@CAPS6! Its moving, whatever @CAPS5 is @CAPS5's moving @CAPS7!"" @CAPS3 as I approach the girls @PERSON2 rips the flash light out of me hands, turns @CAPS5 on @PERSON2 points @CAPS5 to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot @PERSON2 the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for @CAPS5 to move again @CAPS5 finally did. I flashed @CAPS5 with the flash light @PERSON2 started laughing. As soon as @PERSON2 get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to @PERSON1 @PERSON2 ask her ""@CAPS3 @PERSON2, do you want to see your monster?"" @CAPS4 freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, ""take a look at @CAPS5 for yourself"" @CAPS4 looked up @PERSON2 saw @CAPS5.... A large brown paper bag that got swept up by the wind. As soon as I see that @CAPS4 say @CAPS5 I told @PERSON2 what @CAPS5 was @PERSON1 her @PERSON2 I started cracking up laughing about @PERSON1 @PERSON2 her ""hideous monster"". Once I got my laughs out on @PERSON2, we all went back to the car where @PERSON3 was waiting @PERSON2 we left.

You will hardly come across me with out a big old smile plastered across my face. There is so many stores to choose from but @TIME1 one will be the most fun to tell i think. It still makes me giggle just thinking about that @TIME1. I was going on a trip with my last boyfriend, @PERSON1, down to @LOCATION1 for the forth of @DATE1. They have a big forth of @DATE1 walk and i was lucky to get to tag along with him and his mom. We wear staying with good friends of his mom @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. There house was stunningly amazing, beaut full wood floors, big open living room that combined with the kitchen and dining room, vaulted ceilings, and a big stunning window that framed crisp @CAPS3. @CAPS4. Even with the house being so great my favorite part wear the rail rode tracks. Not more than a quarter of a mile through a little trail surrounded with woods wear two sets of tracks stretching out in both directions @CAPS5 far @CAPS5 the eye could see. My favorite part of the hole trip wear those tracks. It was the second @TIME1 of our stay in @LOCATION1 around @NUM1 o clock. @PERSON1 and i when for a walk in the refreshing @TIME1. We could hardly see and wear holding on tight to each other to try and keep balance. Smiling and giggling we finally stumbled out of the very well hidden trail entrance on to the tracks. Hand in hand we started to walk down the tracks just enjoying each others presents. In @CAPS4 the stars are the most stunning i have ever seen. I'm not sure why but the sky just seems to open up and look two times bigger than it relay is. @TIME1 @TIME1 was perfect for star gazing with out a cloud in sight. So we decided to lay down between the tracks and look at the stars. There we cuddled together for a good @NUM2 minuets. Then @PERSON1 looked up. I gave him a puzzled expression then i followed his gaze to see what had aroused him. Far in the distance was a light. Slowly advancing t words use. Sure-a-nuff it was a train at @NUM1 o clock at @TIME1. Looking back at each other we both laughed at the pure surprise of a train at @TIME1. @CAPS5 the train advanced we jumped up and off the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could resume our spot.  The train was going way slower than i was expecting. No more than @NUM4 to @NUM5 mile per hour. @PERSON1's eyes lit up with an idea and not thinking he said ""We should jump it!""  @CAPS5 soon @CAPS5 the words left his mouth he regretted saying them. I thought it was a great idea! But he tried desperately to convince me not to do it. I headed twords the track telling him to live a little and lets have some fun. I had never jumped a train before but from the looks of it @TIME1 train was perfect to try it out on. There wear long flat bead cars with handy little latters on each one. I garbed for one and jumped on right before @PERSON1 could stop me. He finally gave in and jumped on the next one. We wear both smiling and having a great @TIME1 when we jumped off and met in a hug. Then the train stopped. We froze. Then a light started coming our way. Freaking out, for sure thinking we would get in trouble i sprinted for the trail head with @PERSON1 close on my heals. I could not find the trail and the light was getting closer so we both jumped full speed straight in to a big bunch of bushes. There we stayed perfectly still tell the light passed us and the train began to rezoom its pace. I met @PERSON1's big fat smile and we both just rolled over laughing not being able to help ourselves. What wear the chances of going out for a simple walk and all @TIME1 happening. Still smiling hugely @PERSON1 leans over to me and gave me a perfect kiss. That was one of my best nights ever. @TIME1 is just an example of how smiling and laughter was a big part of @PERSON1's and I in our relationship.

20883,8,"Being able to laugh, is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share it with is priceless. Family moments like that, are times no one can take away. They will be there for you to look back on and just smile on those days. Not being able to laugh would make this world dull and a very depressing place. Laughter is the main connection between family and friends.  My family and I decided that for our @DATE1 break we would drive to the great land of @LOCATION1. Not one of us @CAPS1 how to get there, but my mom told us she would figure it out and for us not to worry about it. So the day we were released from school my mom packed us up and off we went.After two long hours of driving we finally arrived at the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The crowd to get across was huge. On the boat to get across, I thought about going up stairs to see where we were at. There it was @LOCATION2.  Once we got off the boat and through the crowed highways of @LOCATION2, and started to make our way across the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 border. I noticed that my mother had a weird look on her face, the look of worry. My sister asked her if she @CAPS1 what she was doing, she replied ""kinda"". After hours and hours of driving my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map. When we looked at the map we noticed a little town that was very close. When we arrived my mom said we will stay here for the night. When we all woke up my mother told us that she remembered that the town we were staying in is the town we were suppose to be in. After driving around the town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room resting from driving around. My sister made a comment to my mom, about how funny it was to watch her drive around and act like she @CAPS1 what she was doing. This made all of us laugh. We all started to make random comments on her great navigation skills. The rest of the trip we drove around laughing and telling my mom, don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them. laughing about us getting lost made the trip a truly unforgettable moment.   Being able to laugh, is the greatest feeling in the world. To do it with family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and dull.

20884,8," Laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together over the same thing, a special bond is made that is like no other. There is no way to describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Every person on this @LOCATION2 will hopefully experience the bond that laughter brings. Last @DATE2, I was a member of a select lacrosse team and I didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice, I still hadn't talked to many girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I made a comment to one of the girls and she laughed. We began talking and throughout the rest of that practice, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. The final practice was cut short so that the team could create tie-dye t-shirts to wear at the tournament. I sat down with @PERSON2, the girl I had become friends with at the previous practice, and her friend @PERSON1 came over to sit with us on the concrete. We all began talking and laughing with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to put the dye onto them. We were laughing and making a mess of the multiple colors, having a good time and enjoying the warm night. As we finished our shirts and put the sopping wet clothing into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot and said our goodbyes. I now had two friends on the team and could not wait to leave for the tournament that @DATE1. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up at @NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION1, OR. We were all meeting there to load our things into the three large white vans and to drive up as a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie-dye t-shirt to see some of the girls looking tired and also sporting the tie-dyed shirts. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were in the back with another girl in between them so I sat in the row ahead of them. Some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way. During the @NUM2 @NUM3 hour car ride we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we all bonded with each other over laughter and story telling. We each came from different cities, schools and backgrounds which made for a very entertaining car ride.  At the tournament, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals and laughed together almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roomates were assigned and we were not put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal, winning games and making it to the championship. All of the girls on that team bonded in some way and even now, most of us are still in contact with each other.  Laughter is what brought @PERSON2 and me together and the rest of the team followed. The entire team bonded over laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other through laughing and having a good time. Putting @NUM4 girls together from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other by making other laugh, making it a positive experience for all involved. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience that everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a little better, a little brighter, and united together as one.",20.0,23.0,,43.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,5,,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

20885,8,"   Humor is a huge part of who i am,and i love making people laugh, but this story is about an event that made my whole family fall down laughing on the floor. It all started one @DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted. We were always over at my cousins house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while but they would always cave and let us back on it. It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest accident that any of us had ever seen in our life time. It all started out at my aunts birthday party. Usually she had it at some fancy restaurant but not this year, this year she decided just to have it at home to save some money. So we all show up for my aunts party my mom, my brothers, and me. First off we do all the regular birthday things, the meeting of family members, eating some food, and singing happy birthday. Basically in my eyes it was all the boring stuff. I mean come on there was a trampoline out in the back yard just waiting to be jumped on but the adults wouldn't let us get anywhere near it until we had ate. Finally everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids go have our fun. It started off as normal as any other day we went to play on the trampoline but little did we know that all of our stomachs would be hurting from laughing in a few hours from an even that was about to transpire",15.0,19.0,,34.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay has a clear main idea and supporting details.

We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM1, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON1 house and hungout with all the girls.We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM3 and @PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it.",15.0,17.0,,32.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,15,,": The essay is about a day in the student's life.

The essay is well-organized and easy to follow. However, the student could have provided more details about each event.

20888,8," @CAPS1 is my personal belief that that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in. Therefore @CAPS1 makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things would be of good relations. @CAPS1 is because of their likeness of minds that they are connected and find happiness in each others company. My story is an example of laughter's connection between people and the strength of the bond @CAPS1 forms. Picture the scene: @CAPS1 was @DATE2 on the north side of @CAPS2. Hood below the infamous snow dome. Standing there was a weak eleven year old boy who thought he could not continue further. Patiently standing beside him was his father, a climbing veteran who had scaled mountains in @LOCATION1,and @LOCATION2. The boy was tired, he could not put one foot in front of the other. His muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. The @DATE1 sun beat down on him while the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. @CAPS1 was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat. Fatigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs. His brain had dimmed as well leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting on foot in front of the other. He began finding any excuse to stop and made them often. The boy's father had tried everything he could think of to give his son the incentive to keep going with no avail. He tried another tack, he began to tell the boy stories, perhaps in hope that @CAPS1 would take the boy's mind of the excruciating pain.And to the relief of all concerned, @CAPS1 proved effective. What was most interesting about the whole event is @CAPS1 wasn't the content of the stories that helped, @CAPS1 was the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference.An infusion that I would describe as a solution of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me. In the presence of my father's humor I found the strength to keep going . @CAPS1 was like I had been completely recharged and refreshed. My arms and leg which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead lightened considerably. The stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left. The dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels were silenced. This was all due to someones thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone. I believe laughter to be the anesthetic of nature,the emotional element that keeps the world sane. @CAPS1 was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my father. I had no shortage of traits to choose from. He had a indomitable work ethic, was a great teacher, and possessed an extraordinary amount of energy. But what I respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor. We laughed at the same things and found hilarity at each others comment's. @CAPS1 forged a strong bond between us, one constructed of euphoria and glee that continues to this day. Whenever I am morose he always manages to find away to bring a smile to my face and I found that I to had the same ability. To my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way to friendship,respect,and love. You cannot have hope for a better future if you do not have laughter. @CAPS1 is the drug that descends from the heavens. A drug that runs through the bloodstream of society. In the process freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned to find that at the exact same moment someone across the room had also began to laugh. Then your eyes lock and a slow smile spread's throughout both of your faces, as you realize that you are not alone in how you think and what you laugh at. That connective force is a result of the power of laughter.",19.0,25.0,50.0,50.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,4,,":**

20889,8," Laughing, smirking, giggling, @CAPS1 chuckling; these all have to do with one subject, @CAPS1 that is, laughing. Laughter is everywhere, you hear it in libraries, parks, at home, behind your back, @CAPS1 it can be a great thing or a horrible thing in @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 even with family @CAPS1 friends. Everyone has a past with laughing that has welcomed them, helped them out, cheered them up, or even, just so they can make a very special friend that will stay with them forever. It was the start of a brand new @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 I had just moved from @LOCATION2. I was a seventh grader about to start at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wasn't a real big fan of hanging out with people , so i stayed to myself most of the weeks, eating lunch in the guidance center, trying to figure out where books where without talking to anybody. My schedule was good, I had choir, art, drama, you know all the stuff I like. Art @CAPS1 drama were a blast, but when it came to choir @CAPS1 singing, my social level went down. I love to sing, but never did it in front of people. Then one day, I was walking to choir @CAPS1 I tripped @CAPS1 fell, my papers falling with me. My @ORGANIZATION1 work was all over the hall, math at one end, science at the other. But, out of all the kids in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked by @CAPS1 say I did a great job but something triggered her to come back. She helped me pick up all my math homework @CAPS1 picked up my schedule @CAPS1 saw that she too had choir this period. Her name was @PERSON1, she told me, @CAPS1 i told her my name, @CAPS1 we walked together. We sat next to each other @CAPS1 i sang with her ours voices in harmony. We talked in between periods, at lunch, on the bus ride home. We became great friends @CAPS1 the principal thought so too @CAPS1 he went ahead @CAPS1 gave us classes together. We were friends @CAPS1 we still are friends till this day. But the sad thing is is that she moved at the near end of eighth grade year. But she was the only friend I had for a little while @CAPS1 I always give her a call every now @CAPS1 then. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing @CAPS1 talking about how we are doing @CAPS1 when we are going to see each other again. She has been my best friend for at least two years now @CAPS1 it all happened by a slip of a foot, that falling of papers, @CAPS1 one little laugh from an amazing person. Laughing has got me so far in life @CAPS1 at @ORGANIZATION1. Every now @CAPS1 then, when i see someone, all alone, wanting a friend, I go @CAPS1 talk to them, @CAPS1 even laugh with them. One little laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen. Even if you don't think so, it does.

20892,8,"  When it comes down to laughter, it can change a person's thinking or even the mood that @CAPS4 are in. Laughter can be the ending result, to a bad start to a day or to greater the relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it shows how I am feeling and it keeps me happy, I not only laugh when I'm sad, but also when I'm in a great mood as well. Growing up in a world full of tragedies and war, I feel like you should always keep your head held high and the smiles flowing. Although, when life gives you lemons, you must make lemonade and keep your face with the sour look because it's funny! I think that laughter is one of the best medicines around and can fix most problems whenever you are feeling down.  @CAPS2 older sister brought into this world the most amazing little nieces, an aunt could ever have. When @CAPS4 were little babies I used make silly faces, dance to @PERSON1 and watch movies with them, but this isn't what brought us closer. It was the fact that I wanted to laugh, in which made them happy too. One time, I was feeling really down and out, but I didn't want that to affect me, so I preceeded with @CAPS2 day and began to watch music videos, when ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"", by @ORGANIZATION1 came on. @CAPS4 went crazy!, @CAPS4 started jumping on the bed and twirling their @CAPS3 back and forth as if @CAPS4 were @ORGANIZATION1!, @CAPS4 really stole the show. I couldn't believe before @CAPS2 eyes that this one happening, and I bursted out with so much joy. I felt so much of their joy, that I had to get up and dance with them, we jumped, we twirled, and whipped our @CAPS3 several times before the song ended with us dizzy and out of breath. After we had our fun of the music video, @CAPS4 just kept dancing and in @CAPS2 head I'm, like ""don't @CAPS4 ever get tired"", but I was pretty sure that their laughter brought them continouis amazement. A smile is worth a thousand words and laughter is priceless, @CAPS2 nieces really and are truly what brought me up that day. It was bitter in the start but then ended up sweet, lets just called it bittersweet. I feel like @CAPS2 nieces knew that I would be sad so @CAPS4 would say ""@CAPS5, what's wrong"", @CAPS5 being @CAPS2 nickname because I am very short. @CAPS4 would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. Me and @CAPS2 neices relationship has grown to the highest extent and I know that whenever I'm with them, I will laugh. If someone once said that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", then @CAPS4 are correct because I @MONTH1 be in a different country, state or any other area but whether we talk on the phone or actually see each other, I will laugh about all their crazy antics and the closer we become as one.

20893,8," Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are. Some people think that you @MONTH1 be one person who can be ""stuck up"" or a funny person who can really be ""stuck up"", but in the end your all laughing together no matter who they are. When you see something happen real funny you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off. All different kinds of people have different ways in showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. ""@CAPS1 are blue, roses are red, your always in my head, i want you in my bed...."" That's suppose to be a love poem. When your in a relationship with someone you might think your in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughter. For example my friend and I were invited to a birthday party, she had lots of fun games and lots of food. My friend that went with me to the party her name is @PERSON1. It was gettting late, and we were tired. We were not doing anything this was probably around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. See us for some reason do love to sleep, but we were just having such a great time at our friends house we just didn't want the night to end at all.  We al sat and layed there on the ground and bed for about four hour earlier watching ""@CAPS2 A"". Then out of random i started to laugh at @LOCATION1, and till this day I don't know why i was laughing at her. All of the sudden she started to laugh a lot harder at me, then I was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe no more. So I got up walk my self to the bathroom, but i could still hear @CAPS3 laughter in the room which was still making me laugh.  Since that night @PERSON1 and I got a lot closer in our friendship. Laughter is a lot in life. It might make you feel like your dying sometimes, but that feeling is worth it.",17.0,20.0,,37.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,,,"**Ideas and Content**

20894,8," As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, ""@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION1's house celebrating @PERSON2's birthday, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS3 then @PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile.",18.0,18.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20895,8," Just @CAPS1 walking through @ORGANIZATION2 in a banana costume with one of your best friends. We were trying to find the best costumes for a @CAPS2 party. When having so much fun by taking many pictures and videos we lost track of time. I can't even remember which one of us was laughing the hardest. @CAPS3 is just one example of the crazy things my friend @PERSON1 and I have done together. One thing is for certain, whenever we are together we are always laughing. Laughter reduces stress for both @PERSON1 and I. We were team members for the past six years. Both of us competed as gymnasts at @ORGANIZATION1. We worked out at the gym @DATE1 for four hours each day. That gave us no time to hang out with friends and just enough time to do homework. At @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I needed to be focused so we wouldn't get hurt. @CAPS3 meant off the floor we needed laughter to reduce stress, as well as fear. In order to do that we would hang out a lot on the weekends and in the @DATE2 sun.  Our friendship was strong because of all the laughing and fun times together. When either of us became stressed we would make the other cheer up by remembering the times when we laughed our heads off. Even when we are not together we often think of the memories we have shared together. As mentioned earlier laughter also helps to reduce fear. It helps because if you were not having fun and laughing you would think about all of the bad things at could happen to you; then would you do have laughter involved it makes you want to do whatever it would be with your friend.  The laughter @PERSON1 and I shared always attached others to us. Whenever we were together others always wanted to join is because we were having such a great time together. For example, @DATE2 we were at @LOCATION1's house and we were playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing and all of a sudden one of her neighbors shows up. After one came, more and more kids and her friends came, after awhile it seemed like we had the whole neighborhood there with us. When we had a big group of people, @PERSON1 and I would choose a different game that would be better for a lot of people. It usually was a hide and go seek tagging game. Even though it wasn't just the two of us we were always laughing because we would trick everyone that was playing. It created a good and positive bond for the two of us even though there were more people. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS3 is how @PERSON1 and I became such amazing friends today. Without laughter, I do not think we would have been as close of friends if we didn't have laughter in our friendship. Our laughter brings us closer together every single time we see each other.

20897,8," Laughter is the best way to show someone that they are funny. It is the best way to relax. Everyone says that hearing a baby laugh is great. Watching comedians doing their acts can cheer people up and have them start laughing. Laughter is the best way to relax and here is three reason for that. First, is that no one can stay angry at the person making them laugh. Second, is that when someone laughs everyone around that person start laughing. Third and last reason, is that no one can stay sadden when something funny is happening. What do you think when you hear a baby's laughter? I think that the baby is truly loved by its family. He or she is having a bast playing with someone in the family or themselves. They think that whatever you are doing is funny. A comedian's job is to make a crowd of people laugh at or with them. One way a comedian does an act is stand up comedy. That is when a comedian is on stage and does his or her act. Another way is a comedy. A comedy can be a @CAPS1.V. show, a play, or a movie. Comedies usually do not have a plot, but the point is to make you and anyone else start laughing. That is what I think about laughter. It helps anyone relax. Hearing a baby's laugh is great.

20898,8," @CAPS6 only happened a few weeks ago on a day the all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside. A guy was crying on his chair with his hands over his eyes, a french horn in his lap and his gaze fixed on the ground below him. Sobs choked the sound in the band room but luckily for this guy's pride there weren't too many people in the room to start off with. The guy's head rose up, the tears seemed to eat the self sturdiness of his normal self, and @CAPS2 spoke to the person who always sat to his left. "" @CAPS1 just don't understand @PERSON2"" the broken, voice cracked on words ""I don't care that @CAPS1 play in cascade winds or that @CAPS1 get private lessons or that @CAPS1've gone to state honor band! This @MONTH1 sound like a terrible reason, but i just want to play first because i want to play first, and @CAPS1 never let us play first."" @CAPS2 was right about one thing, @PERSON2 really never let us play first. I somehow understood where @CAPS3 was coming from; @CAPS4 my freshman year i had always sat under him, and him under someone else and so forth. I had never seen him be first chair on anything. And now on his senior year, a prodigy child had come into band and she only knew how to fight for her position as first chair. In short @CAPS3's four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room. The feeling of all his hard work turned into mediocre in his face, with time, had broken him to tears.  @PERSON2 was much better than us and she has the accolades to prove @CAPS6. She had attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival, band camp, and would be going to @LOCATION1 as an ambassador of music. Still something about her having first part still didn't feel quite right. Maybe @CAPS6 was my sense of wanting superiority as well. @PERSON2 took in the words, leaned closer to say. "" I understand that @CAPS1 want first"" @CAPS10 with confident tones she said ""but right now we need specific players in specific spots. I've played harder music and my skills are whats needed on first part. I understand what your feeling, ive been there before.""  @CAPS6 struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior. How could she have felt what @CAPS2 was feeling? she'd been a prodigy child in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 from the start. I sided with @PERSON1 but @CAPS10 I realized that letting him play a more demanding part would be worse for the band. So i tried siding with @PERSON2 but @CAPS10 all i could think about was that this was @PERSON1's last year to shine as a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 french horn player.They kept going at eachother. Every comment scraping at the already fragile surface of the argument. Minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile.  I had to think faster. @CAPS9 the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and co-operation would be useless. More importantly I would lose two partners that together had uprooted a great deal of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts. ""@CAPS9 a man has no socks,"" I liked starting out my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings, "" @CAPS10 so will..."".And that's as far as i got. I thought @CAPS6 was brilliant, their faces said otherwise. So they called me crazy and giggled @CAPS10 they made fun of me and laughed. Thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say. @CAPS3 stopped crying, finally, and @PERSON2 got my message that @CAPS3 was a senior and didn't really have many more chances at playing first chair in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 band. They settled the fight with a simple deal; @CAPS3 would get fist chair as soon as we stopped competing. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 I've been the center of being made fun of. But as annoying as @CAPS6 gets sometimes its usually funny for everyone, including myself.  I cant even begin to imagine what band would be like @CAPS9 their enmity had risen to the no forgiveness zone. There had been times before when heated discussions left the stress levels in our section so @CAPS7 @CAPS6 made @CAPS6 hard to breath right. Having laughter come in even right before they were about to rip eachother's faces off gave them time to understand that they had mutual understanding of each other. Or opened their eyes to how long they're going to have to sit next to each other i they were to continue fighing. Either way, @CAPS6's definatley changed the way they feel about eachother; I haven't heard them complian about one another for a while. @CAPS3 is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and @PERSON2 for better or worse can't wait to see him play.",23.0,21.0,,44.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20899,8,"We're happy together @PERSON1 told me @CAPS2 we lay on his bed. I just smiled and I knew this was going to be a really good relationship. @CAPS5 always made me feel so great. @CAPS5 made me feel beautiful. Now don't say your too young to know what love is ,@CAPS1 I've heard it from my mom every time I talked about him. But I know that no one has ever made me feel this wonderful about myself, made me feel perfect. When we are together it's fun. Most guys I have been with have not been @CAPS2 fun, @CAPS2 in our dates together, walking to the park too sit and talk, eating out to kiss in public. Before we were ever dating, We were best friends. We still are best friends. Everyone asked us @CAPS6 we were dating, The answer was always no we're best friend's, but I always wanted more. @CAPS5 has always made me laugh. I don't think we would have made such a strong couple @CAPS6 we didn't make each other laugh. Just thinking about @CAPS4 I first knew I loved him makes me laugh. I was walking to my @DATE1 class, and out of no where @PERSON1 grabs my arm and pulls me into a huge bear hug, and buried his head in my neck and laughed and said ""@CAPS3, you have some toilet paper sticking out of your pants"" I felt my face turn twenty different shades of red. I smiled and quietly asked him to hide me so I could grab it. When I got to my @DATE1 class I was thinking to myself @CAPS4 could @CAPS5 just say that to me, @CAPS5 must of wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about what @CAPS5 did and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 did it made me feel, well it made me feel like @CAPS5 really and truly cared about me. Wanting to help me out rather then embarrass me. I bet every other guy was laughing. Not @PERSON1... well after that happened we had a good laugh. After we laughed and joked about what happened to me, @CAPS5 looked up and kissed me. I didn't know @CAPS6 that was a best friend kiss, or a real love kiss. So I simply laughed. then @CAPS5 kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real love kiss. We weren't like most couples either. Which made us stand out, and the more we stood out the more people started to hate the fact that we were together. They would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about @PERSON1. Who knows what they were telling him. @CAPS7 some of my closest friends started to make rude comments toward me and @PERSON1. I know @CAPS5 didn't believe anything they were saying @CAPS1 @CAPS5 would laugh at everything people would toss our way. When @CAPS5 laughed I would always ask him whats so funny, @CAPS5 would say ""@CAPS6 they rumors aren't true then laugh about them, that way people will know your not bother by them"" I would have never thought about that. I'm the kind of girl who wears her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I would get a little peeved with all the stuff they were saying about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people were saying,. They stopped talking about us, it was like magic. I never thought about being in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 let alone @ORGANIZATION1, and finding a guy that would understand what I'm going through. Let alone someone who is going through something almost @CAPS2 difficult. My brother went to prison @DATE1, and I don't think I could have be able to make it through @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 I did with @PERSON1. I cried almost everyday at @ORGANIZATION1 with him. It's been about a year now. Every time I go see my brother I remember what @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS6 your happy the people around will be happy"" so I always put on a smile to see @LOCATION1, @CAPS7 though I know this will be the hardest years of my life. Laughing does really help. @CAPS7 @CAPS6 nothing is funny just laugh. God put you on this @LOCATION2 for a reason, and @CAPS6 you haven't found that reason laugh until you do. @CAPS1 the people in your life mean the world to you, and @CAPS6 they're down bring them up. I love @PERSON1 for helping me understand that life's to short to go unhappy then to have had a life without laughter.",17.0,20.0,,37.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20900,8," Everyone loves to laugh; I don't think everyone understands the effect laughter can have on two people though. For example, there can be two complete strangers, who have never seen each other before in their life; as soon as they start laughing they could become good friends. You'll never know how close you can be with someone if you don't ever sit down and talk, laugh, and get to know them. You could go your whole life being at @CAPS4 with just a minute amount of friends but then there could be @NUM1 other classmates you've never talked to that could also become your friends, too. I'm sure just getting to know one another would make a difference in someones life because for me there has been many situations where laughing has made an impact on my relationship with someone; especially with my best friend, @PERSON1. When I first met my friend @PERSON1 we didn't know each other at all but laughing broke the ice. A simple laugh made us comfortable and everything was less awkward. As soon as we started laughing more and more, we couldn't stop; the rest was history. I went to elementary @CAPS4 with @PERSON1 for @NUM2 years and never talked to her but then when we got into @NUM3 grade we started hanging out with the same people and started talking more. By @NUM4 grade we began to hang out outside of @CAPS4 and talking, sharing secrets, and having sleep overs. But ""breaking the ice"" isn't the only impact laughing can have on a relationship. When I'm with @PERSON1, I know I can trust her and everything is fun. We always have conversations to talk and laugh about. You could say it made us closer. By the time @NUM5 grade came we were best friends, we had sleepovers every single weekend at one anothers house. When the @DATE1 before our @NUM6 grade year at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 came we were spending weeks at each others houses. There wasn't a day that went by that we weren't together, talking, or making plans over the @DATE1 to hang out. Now, we can be ourselves around each other; we can always have a good time. Making people closer is just a small part of the effects that just one laugh can do to two people. When I'm sad about something @PERSON1 makes everything better; also vise versa; I make her feel better, too. We always have each others back. I know we will always be there for each other; I'll always have a shoulder to cry on. We have become such close friends that when @PERSON1 was having problems at home she needed a place to live in order for her to not have to go to The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, so she moved in with me! It has been the most fun living with her. We thought we would start to argue and not be as close since we would always be together and probably get annoyed of each other but we haven't. @PERSON1 and I can hang out @NUM7 and always be together; it's like having another sister.  @PERSON1 and I are super close, and she plans to stay living with me for the rest of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 until we graduate. It's amazing to think us being best friends and tremendously close, living together, always being together, and being totally comfortable with each other on everything just started out with a simple laugh when we first started talking in the @NUM3 grade. This is why I believe that just laughing can make two strangers, that have never even spoken, can turn into being the closest of friends.",22.0,20.0,,42.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20901,8," One @DATE1 @TIME1 back in @DATE2 a couple of friends and I were beyond bored. Nothing seemed fun to do. @CAPS1 to a movie, @CAPS1 to get some food, not even call of @CAPS2 sounded entertaining. @LOCATION1 parents told us to go do something outside. Before leaving his house he slips into his pantry and grabs two hefty rolls of @CAPS11 wrap. ""I think I have an idea"" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 as we walk away from his house. I have no clue where we're walking to. @PERSON1 just keeps saying ""follow me."" We all follow in a pack down the street until we show up at @ORGANIZATION1.   Cold and confused, we sit in the parking lot of the @ORGANIZATION1 waiting for all cars to be gone. Once all the cars are gone @PERSON1 informs us on what we are doing here. He tells us of something he did with his cousins awhile back. You have three people on the roof of @ORGANIZATION1's @ORGANIZATION1 scoping out the road and you have four @CAPS4. ""@CAPS4?"" I question @PERSON1 with a dumb-found look on my face. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS4"" @CAPS6 @CAPS4 are the people who will be putting the @CAPS11 wrap across the street. The plan is when no cars are coming in the distance, we hop the fence and put @CAPS11 wrap across the street so cars drive through it and stop. ""@CAPS7 sounds fun, but uh what happens when the @CAPS15 stops before the @CAPS11 wrap and takes it down?"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9, looking down on the whole operation.  @PERSON1 laughs a little bit and @CAPS8 ""@CAPS10 then it will be an inconvenience for the driver."" @CAPS11 wrapping roadways sounded a lot for fun then black ops so we were all down.  Everyone gets in position. Mark, @PERSON4, @PERSON2 and myself are down by the roadway in a secluded area by some bushes. While @PERSON1, @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 are posted up on the roof giving us updates about the oncoming traffic. We get a call from @CAPS9 saying that it is clear for awhile. I hang up the phone, tell the guys and @DATE3 up from the ground. We all get over the fence in quick time and start a first layer of @CAPS11 wrap. I get another call. It's @CAPS14 saying that there are three cars are almost to our location. We drop the @CAPS11 wrap in the bush and get back over the fence. The @CAPS15 comes up close and it's a cop. Of course. We all just stay hidden down in the bushes while the cop takes our huge roll of wrap. We are only left with one more roll , which should before enough.  @CAPS9 calls again and @CAPS8 it's clear. We go out again and start to set up the prank. We wrap it around @NUM1 times and make it as tight as it possibly could be. Perfect.  ""@CAPS15 incoming! Go! Go! Go!"" yells mark while trying to get over the fence. We all make it over in time and go prone in the field. Laying there anxiously someone whispers ""here it comes.""  The @CAPS15 slams on it's breaks, and the driver gets out. He looks at @CAPS11 wrap in disgust and looks around for the kids responsible. @CAPS9 lets out a big ""hahaha"" from the roof that even we can hear perfectly. The guy walks up the fence looks around a bit more and mutters for foul words under his breath. He didn't even bother continuing through, he just got in his @CAPS15 and backed up.""@CAPS16 my god dude that was hilarious!"" I say with a wide grin on my @NUM2 @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 come dashing through the field with a scared expression on all of their faces.""@CAPS18!"" yells @CAPS19 scurried into different directions. Mark, @PERSON2 and I jolt over the fence and hide in the play structure for awhile. While the rest of the boys are booking it to a safe haven. We eventually all meet back up at @LOCATION1 house without getting ""caught"" by the authorities.

20902,8," I agree when people say laughter is what mostly brings people together. In my opinion, @NUM1 of the time your talking to someone, laughter is needed. It is what brings the dullness out of a person, and makes the conversation interesting. Only when you are talking about something serious, you dont need to include laughter, but ill explain later. So I can easily tell a true story about laughter from my life. Right now i have a perfect group of friends. Sure there are times when they mess up and act like kids, but i feel like i need to forgive and remember that they are there when i need them. Anyways, i can remember the first time i met each one of them, and the one thing that started our friendship was a joke. I can't exactly remember which joke we shared, but i do remember that we all had the same taste in comedy. And once we saw that neither of us were serious and dull people, made us want to spend more time with eachother. That is why laughter builds a string between different people, and brings them closer together day by day. So as time passed, my friends and i were really drawn to eachother. What i mean is that, from time to time, we were happy to express our friendship through jokes. Sometimes the jokes are really stupid. Many of them have caused pain - physically, and have caused us to bring revenge on eachother. But that is just how, we stay close to eachother. Day by day, when we see something funny on the television, internet, or real life, we always show it to eachother, and know that after showing this prank, or whatever it is, the other person will find it very funny. It makes us feel closer, and know we all have a same taste in atleast one field. I can give one clear example of this: I was watching a comedy once, and the comedian was talking about his childhood, and a prank he once played on a strangers house. Right when i saw this video, i knew right away, my friends had to see this, because i knew from past experiences, that they enjoy these types of laughs. And i was right, as soon as they saw the show, they were amazed at how funny it was, and they were glad i shared it with them, we got closer than ever. I want to share one more example from my life, about laughter bringing two people closer. So after telling you that laughter gets me closer with friends, i also want to point out that laughter brings out a sence of outline when if you talk to girls - or boys, if you're a female. So i met this one girl, and everytime i talked to her, everytime i had to throw in a joke or a story that would make sence to our subject. After a while, she started joking around, and making stories too. She told me that she saw me as a different guy, comparing me to other people. She said that she meant i wasnt a boring type of person, and that it kept her wanting to keep talking to me. I always hoped not to be a dull person, and jokes made that not happen. Now, me and this girl are closer than ever, and the root that started this relationship was laughter. So as you see, laughter makes any relationship happy and open. Of course im talking about the relationships that are playful, i meant there are people out there that take everything serious, and can't take a joke. But i would really encourage you to take laughter in your life, if you already havent. Look in my life, i used laughter, and gained a lot of friends, of all sorts - just by joking around about something stupid. You don't have to say stupid things, but I say it would really make your life more interesting if you use laughter.",20.0,18.0,40.0,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20904,8," These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life  @CAPS1 all started in the @DATE1 time when i was like @NUM1 years old and my cousins were living with @CAPS3 cause they had just moved down to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2. @CAPS1 was fun having them around. @CAPS3 and my cousin @PERSON7 and my cousin @PERSON3 who lived right next to @CAPS3 would always ride bike. Some times joey would take my bike with out asking @CAPS3 and i would get so mad at him.he would take my bike like if @CAPS1 was his. @CAPS3 and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes.  I was always the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a @PERSON4 @CAPS1 was a @CAPS2 bike witch is a bike made for the dirt and to race. @CAPS3 and my cousins would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made. @CAPS1 was just dirt but @CAPS1 was hard. One day when @CAPS1 was raining so hard @CAPS3 , @PERSON7 , @PERSON3 and another neighbor of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @CAPS1 was okay same with @PERSON3. Joeys @CAPS4 said he could not cause @CAPS1 was raining hard outside but he still came outside. we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while @CAPS1 was all muddy. then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike.  By the time we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt. my @CAPS4 was mad at @CAPS3 cause i was so muddy so she send @CAPS3 straight to the shower . @CAPS3 and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super @PERSON5 bros for super @ORGANIZATION1. If we were not playing the super @ORGANIZATION1, riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since @CAPS1 was so hot out side. We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch. a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating @CAPS3 my cousin @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 would always trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards back then every body had @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. i had piles of cards. @CAPS1 was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park. When i was in @NUM2 grade @CAPS3 @PERSON2 @CAPS14 and @PERSON6 @CAPS15 were like the three amigos we would stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house like almost every weekend. we would always stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide-seek and cause @PERSON6 had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION2 birthday @CAPS3 @PERSON2 and @CAPS17 slept over at @ORGANIZATION2 house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19 @CAPS1 was a cool games.  I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person . If your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with. Like i would always hang around with @PERSON6, and @PERSON2 cause they would always know how to make @CAPS3 laugh .So thats why i think laughter is inportant to havewith friends or family.

20905,8," Someone once said laughter was the best medicine. To me it was like someone was saying ""@CAPS1! Life isn't gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you @CAPS6!"" @CAPS2 that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say I still laugh at most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think that if I do then everything will just get better. That's not even close to what really happens. In fact it @CAPS6 only cause more pain and suffering in most cases. Like the time where I met this guy named @PERSON1. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. That's how I saw it and that's how he saw it too. When we first started talking to each other it was between notes I would give my friend @CAPS3 and @CAPS8 would give them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper. Instead he had @CAPS3 tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to wright messages in her phone and then I would read them and answer back. it was fun for a while but I wanted to actually meet the guy. I had seen one of his rare pictures and it was true he was very handsome but nothing like a god. He didn't have a wreath over his head with one of those @CAPS5 god skirts. Nope, he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real inamorata. He had jet black hair (he dyed it), bright green eyes, and a smile that could shock the whole world.  Signs were going off in my head telling me to be careful but I never listened to them, they only made my life worse. So one day a few of my friends and I were in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when @PERSON2 (my friend) starts text messaging someone. I was a little curious so I asked in a friendly way who it was. @CAPS8 said it was @PERSON1 and my heart seemed to jump. ""@CAPS6 you tell him I say hello?"" ""@CAPS7."" @CAPS8 told him I said hello and he asked if I was really there and @PERSON2 said yes. That's when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day. We talked all the way back to @LOCATION1. A few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment. He told me about his family (which is a little strange, but I don't judge), his life, his future, what he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug (another of @CAPS3's friends said the same thing but @CAPS8 said he wasn't aloud to). I talked to him about all of it and it was like we understood each other a little bit. I told him about my life but there really wasn't much to tell since my life has always been bromidic. I thought we could actually make things work between us, that is until he moved to @LOCATION2. I was a little upset but it really didn't bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him.  While at school one morning @PERSON2 came over to me and had a careful gaze. I asked what was wrong and then @CAPS8 asked if anything could ruin my day. I told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it. I knew something was wrong and that it had to do with @PERSON1 but I just acted oblivious to it hoping it would lessen the blow I knew was about to come. @CAPS8 said he had told her it wasn't going to work out between him and I. I sat there and like the idiot I was I said I knew it wasn't going to anyways, he was him and I was me. @CAPS8 said he was sorry and all these other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead I ignored it and went on with my life like I think everyone should. Of course a few months later he asked @PERSON2 out but I let it go just as @CAPS8 did when @CAPS8 said no to him and they stopped talking to each other. So who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously hadn't experienced the after effects of it all.

20906,8,"Trust is a huge deal between friends. Friends agree on the same things, say an honest opinion about it, and don't lose the trust between a great friendship. You never know who can stay by you with a full amount of trust between you two.When you trust a friend you depend on them to keep things between each other. Just like my friends and I. We agreed on telling each other everything that has happened and not to lie about anything. We agreed on everything based on trust. Our friendship has always been great with not lying to each other. Telling each other how we feel about certain things. Then we put all our opinions together and come up with a solution that we all agree on. That's why you should depend each other like a team. When you break a trust between a friend, you probably won't get the same trust you had before. You don't really get told anything as much as you use to. An it's like you never should have lost the trust with a friend. You don't seem to be the same because you aren't trusted that much. You get told it was your fault lying or for any reason to be not trusted. Like this one time one of friends didn't tell me the whole truth of what she was doing behind my back. Till I found out what she was doing I lost most of my trust with her. She's not trusted as much she was before, but we are still friends.That's why having trust is a big deal in a friendship or any kind of relationship. You learn to trust each other in different ways, get to know each other more by having the trust between you and other person. You get a lot more attention when you have that trust with other people. You don't seem like you are left out on anything. You see that you can trust more people to when you get to know them. Who knows that you have trust for another person who isn't your best friend.So we all know that trust is a huge deal between two people or maybe even more. You need to work together for the trust. Have a good friendship or relationship to anybody as long as there is trust between you guys. My friends and I have learned a lot from trusting each other in different ways.",24.0,20.0,,44.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,3,,": The essay is clear and focused.

As we went down the run, it was the same old usual every @DATE1 @TIME1. so I talked to my friends @PERSON1 suggested that it was time we went through some new trails. They agreed, so we went down through @TIME1 new area. It was a good trail with many jumps @PERSON1 a lot of powder. It seemed like a perfect area to board in. We all enjoyed it very much. But we realized that it was coming to the end when the trail was getting a little narrow, then suddenly, there was a drop right in front of us. I shifted my board sideways so I can stop, but it didn't help. It was a patch of ice that i hit, @PERSON1 it was no use. I couldn't stop. I fell off, @PERSON1 braced for impact. I was thinking that I was about to be seriously injured because of the rocks below. But luckily, my board was the first to hit the rock, showering the cool @TIME1 with sparks lighting it up. I slid down the snow a couple more feet, trying to stop myself. As I came to a stop, I looked back wondering how I survived that. I was worried that my friends would do the same, but they had stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe on what just happened. I learned a lesson from @TIME1 of to always scope out the area first before you go through it.

20909,8," Laughter, everyone from babies to old people do it. Laughter is an element that helps in life. They say that ""laughter is the best medicine"" it truly is. Laughing lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let loose. In any friendship, relationship, job or sport you need to laugh every once in a while. You can't always be serious. Being serious @NUM1 as they say is not good, it makes people seem like they don't know how to enjoy life or they have no sense of humor.  In the @DATE1 I had a rough volleyball season. A lot of my teammates had problems with me, because I was chosen as captain along side my friend @PERSON1. We weren't the most well liked, but we were liked by some. It was hard for @PERSON1 and I to prove that we were right for the position of captains and that we could lead the team. A few of my teammates at the time quit because they did not want to deal with @PERSON1 and I being captains, but as they quit we moved people from junior varsity up to varsity. The new varsity members had it rough, they struggled a bit trying to get the hang, but they did it they managed to get the hang of how varsity plays and practices. Soon after our mishap of having to replace seven out of fourteen players we had our first game. The game was one of the toughest we had the whole season. In our first set of the we didn't exactly have our minds in it for the first of what would be come a five set, game. We battled back and forth a few points in the first set, but we ended up losing that first set. We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do whether to give up or half-@CAPS1 it was tough, I as one of the captains said ""@CAPS1, we won't get anywhere unless we @CAPS1."" then @PERSON1 says ""I agree, lets @CAPS1 our best and not let them get an easy win."" We did exactly that we tried and we won that second set. It was the third set and we had started to get tired and feel aggravated, so we pushed forward we won the third set. One more set and we would win it. We went on the court and the ball was served we let the ball hit the ground point one to the other team. After that first point it went down hill we let them get the best of us and they won the set. It had come down to the fifth and final set were we would either win or lose. We got on the court knowing that we might lose and started. The first point went to us we went back and forth a ton in the final set. It was a tough battle, but we had done it we won. Later in the season we met the team again and it was a hands down battle we had lost the second time we met them it was not easy at all they didn't allow any room for errors on their behalf, but us we let it all slip. It was time for the state playoffs we had made it to the state finals. The team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before and we were one and one. The line-up was called, national anthem sang, and the coin was flipped, we would receive the serve. The game was in full swing, we were doing great we won the first set by four a tough first game. We went into set two, we lost control. We didn't do what we were suppose to do. We lost the second set it was and confidence hitter. We were down we didn't know what to expect in set three, and as captains the team seeing @PERSON1 and I should have not let ourselves be down. We looked at each other with that look I knew and we just busted out laughing we couldn't stop the team wondered what was wrong. So we explained that in order to win we had to laugh we @MONTH1 feel down, but you have to laugh and the team did we went into the third set confident as ever and we won we didn't stop there we went into the fourth set and won. We had done what we set out to do win! In the end laughing was what we needed to do we had come this far that we could either give up or push and succeed. We looked at the two previous games that we had met the other team before and laughed. We made that our team motto ""laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh"" the season was great looking back on it we were state champs. Now in @DATE2 season we are hoping to repeat state champs.",17.0,17.0,,34.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20910,8," Laughter is a major component in a relationship. Laughter once saved my best freinds relationship with his girlfreind. They had just goten ito the bigest fight I have ever seen. The fight started over something so small and insignificant that neither of them could remember what it was. The fight had a snowball affect untill neither of them knew what they were fighting over. Then one day, while they were taking a break from fighting, we went to see a funny movie. A while into the movie I got up to go to the restroom, and when i got back my freind and his girlfreind were both lauphng histaricly. I asked them what was so funny, but they wouldn't tell me.  @CAPS4 the movie we went to a @CAPS1 restorant for dinner. While we were being seated my freind mumbled something i couldn't hear to his girlfreind, and she burst into laughter. I again asked what was so funny, and again they replied that it was nothing. During dinner, which was extrordiary for @CAPS1 food, my freinds girlfreind got up to go to the restroom. @CAPS4 she was out of earshot, my freind turned to me and said, ""@CAPS3'll never beleive what just happened. Me and her aren't fighting any more. @CAPS4 @CAPS3 left to go to the restroom, I asked her if she could remember what we were fighting over, and she said she had no idea and was just fighting because she diddn't want to loose the arguement. @CAPS4 she said that I fessed up and said i was argueing for the same reason. this made us laugh so hard because we boh realized that the argument could have been over long befor that night."" @CAPS4 this I almost never heard of them fighting again. This was untill they got into another arguement when she moved out of state. The arguement was over the fact that he wanted to do a long distance relationship, but she didn't want to. Since laughter saved their relationship for a little while I strongly believe that Laughter is an important part of a relationship. It also serves as an excelent ice breaker for a conversation.",15.0,17.0,,32.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

There was only one problem, @CAPS6 couldn't reach the pedals. Everyone stood there, silent... then they started busting up laughing because @PERSON1 awkwardly looked like @CAPS6 was dancing in the truck beacuse @CAPS6 was trying to reach the pedals. Then my mom said, ""@CAPS3 someone should go help @PERSON1 get going on the truck."" @CAPS4 that was probably the worst idea ever!  My @CAPS2 is @NUM2 years old, and about @NUM3 pounds, and not in the best shape. @CAPS6 said annoyed, ""@CAPS5 I'll help @PERSON1."" @CAPS6 rolled up off the couch and stood by @PERSON1 and the truck. My dad was giggling in the background. My @CAPS2 said seriously,""I need a stick or something to push on the ""go"" pedal."" @CAPS6 went and found a long stick outside in the snow. They decided that they should try it outside because @PERSON1 wanted to feel the chilling wind on her baby soft face as @CAPS6 was riding in the truck. @CAPS13 my mom bundled up @PERSON1 in @NUM1 jackets, gloves, and a beanie. Somehow they got on top of a @NUM5 foot snowy, and slippery hill we live on. My @CAPS2 pushed down on the ""go"" pedal and it went forward @CAPS4 the front tires got caught on her long dress @CAPS6 was wearing and ran her over! The next thing we know, @CAPS6 is tumbling down the hill screaming on the top of her lungs! That's when her red flowered dress flew up and we could see her tong. My sister said loudly,""That's gross @CAPS2!"" @CAPS9 just some minor bruises and scratches my @CAPS2 was @CAPS5. That was the @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2 ever!

20913,8," Laughter  @CAPS1 brings enthusiasm and joyfulness to any means or matter. Have you ever thought of laughter being a part or key element in a relationship? A time when laughter has really helped or made a relationship is when I met one of my still today best friends. I had just started fifth grade at a new school; I transferred from private to public. There was only a couple of people I knew there because of family, and these people were my cousins. As you can imagine I sat by the people whom I known for most of my life, and being in this position was very awkward. So, eventually at the end of the day I was ready to leave school and it was my first time I ever got to walk home since this school was much closer than my last. I had to walk home with a kid who lived right by me; this I had never known because of my sheltered young life. Luckily he was easy to talk to and we both had something in common which was skateboarding. This is when we started @CAPS1 because we talked about certain falls we had which were not so pleasant and he asked if we could hang out after school, and with me as a shy guy I said okay. After awhile, he came over with his skateboard and he told me to go down this ramp I had. So, I did and fell right on my back which we both thought was hilarious and we started @CAPS1 together. This @CAPS1 we did since walking home really made me feel comfortable with him and kind of bonded us. I feel that fall was a key part of our friendship because it made the awkwardness go right out the window and helped us start talking about more funny thing which we had seen. Ever since, every time we hang out something happens and we laugh as hard as you can imagine which goes down in our memories as good times. @CAPS1 has always ""sweetened the mood"" so to say and always makes a good time a great time to remember or to a truly boring time to a ""lets go do something"" time. Also, in any situation when I have been @CAPS1, or start to laugh, I feel good because every one laughs when I laugh. Most of my friends are also my friends because of my laughs and times I make them laugh. All in all, most of the relationships I have are because of @CAPS1 and how they comfort two or even more people by bonding them, and making every one feel like their having a good time with each other. This is key because than most encounters with people, even friends can be very awkward or not enjoyable. So, really in any case @CAPS1 is necessity because than every thing would be dull, plus you would really have no one to be able to have an appreciative time with. Therefore, every time I meet someone new or even someone I know laughter needs to exist in order to have a relationship with anyone.",15.0,19.0,34.0,34.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4,3,,":**

20914,8," A lot of people always say that a sense of humor is very important when looking for a significant other, or even a friend. @CAPS4 some people don't realize @CAPS1 how much laughter can bring people together! I know now that all it takes is for two people to laugh together to become great friends. My best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 became my friends by doing @CAPS1 that. All my life I've gone to small schools with my aunt, @LOCATION1. We are only two years apart so we usually can stay within the same @ORGANIZATION1, so I never feel alone. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 ended up going to a different @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 than me. I would have to face @ORGANIZATION1 on my own. My freshman year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I was pretty nervous. It was my first time at a huge @ORGANIZATION1, I had @CAPS1 moved and I didn't know anyone, so I was pretty shy. I made my first friend pretty easily during one of my classes; @CAPS3. @PERSON4, the teacher, wanted us to have partners, so that we could do a certain exercise together. @PERSON2 and I both chose each other for some reason, I don't know how, @CAPS4 we were drawn to each other. @PERSON4 told us we would be doing the ""mirror exercise"". We picked somebody to be the mover, and somebody to be the mirror. @PERSON2 ended up being the mover. I had to follow her movements exactly so that @PERSON4 wouldn't be able to tell who the mirror was, @CAPS4 when @PERSON2 started acting like a monkey, we both laughed and @PERSON4 even laughed too. During lunch, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friend, @PERSON1. @CAPS2 claimed to have known her for several years. @PERSON1 and I smiled at each other, @CAPS4 we didn't really talk at all. By the time my last class of the day came around, I was ready to go home, @CAPS5 because it was a @CAPS6 class, I never really liked @CAPS6. I came to find that I shared that class with <@NUM1!</@CAPS7> @CAPS8 we met already, and shared @PERSON2 as a friend, we sat by each other. We still didn't have much to say though. A few days went by and we still didn't really talk, we @CAPS1 awkwardly sat next to one another. Meanwhile, @PERSON2 and I became closer friends, acting out silly skits together in @CAPS3 class laughter was bringing us together, @CAPS4 I didn't really notice, because it wasn't any different then how I've made most of my friends.  One day, we had testing in our @CAPS6 class, we had to go to the computer lab. @PERSON1 and I chose computers next to each other, we started our tests silently, same as always. Then, suddenly @CAPS2 turned to me and asked me if I had ever heard the ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12"". When I, very startled, replied no, @CAPS2 sang it for me, right there in the middle of the computer lab. When @CAPS2 finished we both started laughing so hard that it hurt. Our teacher warned us to be quiet, and we got back to testing with smiles on our faces. After that moment, everything changed! Like magic, @PERSON1 and I started talking and joking all the time! @PERSON2 noticed the change, @CAPS2 was glad we were getting along so well, @CAPS4 wondered what caused the sudden difference. To this day, @PERSON1 and I share laughs whenever we have the time for it. Even though I am busy with babysitting, @ORGANIZATION1, and my job. While @CAPS2 goes to college, nothing can stop the connection we made that day, through the power of laughter! I have learned that laughter is a top basis for any relationship. @CAPS4 it is not the only one. You also need to have trust. If you can't trust some one, @CAPS4 they are humorous, that doesn't make them a good friend. You also need a sense of safety. If your friends are encouraging you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable, they aren't very good friends. I know that @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 are the best friends I will ever have. Laughter brought us together and I know it will keep us together for generations to come!",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20915,8," @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke.

20916,8," Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little. When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing? Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment. I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it. My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade. We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family. After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have. Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying. When your little you think things are a @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they really are, or things are a @CAPS1 more taller @CAPS3 they really are but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors. Well on this particular day @PERSON1 and I chose to ""spy"" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS1. @PERSON1's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive. Eventually @PERSON1's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION1 could try. Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected. As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning. So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. Without laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.  Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel. All the adventures @PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward. You can look back at things and be like, ""@CAPS2 that really sucked."" Or you can look at things and be like, ""That is hilarious."" @CAPS3 laugh tell you cry. I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else. If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same.",20.0,17.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,3,,":**

20917,8,"  The comfort of a laugh. Many different kinds of comfort can come from a laugh. My story is the comfort of love. @CAPS6 i was a young and foolish teen. (@CAPS1 wait that's what i would still be today.) A few days ago my friend @CAPS2 had me laughing so hard, and all because @CAPS5 slipped up while meeting my mother. (@CAPS2 was nerves to meet my mother.) For some reason @CAPS6 i started to laugh @CAPS5 suddenly began to act as if every thing was fine, and that there was nothing to be nerves about.  @CAPS7 latter @CAPS6 we went for our walk i asked him about it. I simply said ""@CAPS4 did your mood change @CAPS6 i began to laugh?"" @CAPS5 smiled and replied ""@CAPS6 you laugh i feel calm and know that i am going to be alright."" @CAPS7 myself being a typical teen girl i blushed, @CAPS7 quickly changed topics, while trying not to make eye contact. Suddenly i could not help my self. The feeling of his eyes on my cheek was over powering my will to not look. Turning my head slowly, sure enough there @CAPS5 was starring straight back in to my eyes, his eyes were wonderful they reminded me of sunflowers with a blue sky behind them. As @CAPS5 stared back i got a feeling as if @CAPS5 were trying to unlock all that i am, and all that i know with his eyes. As if @CAPS5 could see straight to my soul. Quickly I turned away. With a soft and almost beautiful voice @CAPS5 let a little laugh out. This laugh was as sweet to my ears, as nectar is to a hummingbird.  The next few days where hard. All i could think about was that walk. People must have thought i was crazy, every time i would remember the walk, each time i would remember his laugh. @CAPS7 let a laugh of my own out. @CAPS7 i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life. For me i laugh @CAPS6 I'm with the people i love. For some its watching t.v. that they find amusing, or maybe there kids did some thing rather silly. So silly you had to tell your book club. The point is that laughter is every where.  Laughter is never a bad thing in fact it has been proven that laughter has a lot of health benefits. Some people don't get it. Laughter is not some thing to be ashamed of ether, if some one laughs at you just laugh with them. Its not laughter that starts wars. its not laughter that kills people. its people who chose not to fill there lives with the joy of laughter.  So here is the goal. laughter can also be very contagious. So try and @CAPS8 a laugh on. Do some thing that @CAPS6 people remember it they will start there own laughs. Laughter-@CAPS8 it on!",18.0,20.0,,38.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20919,8," Laughter is a sign of good relationships. To some people it's a sign of personality, sign of love and also a sign showing someone that you care.  To me laughter is what makes people so unique. Everybody has a different kind of laugh. For example, when you are a baby @CAPS2 laugh is high pitched. The older you get the lower @CAPS2 laugh becomes, ""like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1"". If it was not for his laugh would not be who he is. When I was a child I remember trying to laugh like just like @ORGANIZATION1 did. I would be walking around the house trying to get my laugh really @CAPS1. My family though it was the best thing ever. They would ask me to laugh like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 so they can get a laugh also.  Now today my laugh is what I wanted it to be, ""@CAPS1"". It is hard for me to laugh quietly now. I have had some people tell me things like; ""@CAPS2 laugh is what I will remember you by"" or ""@CAPS2 laugh is really something else"". I love my laugh because it is part of who I am.

20921,8," Being with family and friends during a memorable trip always seems to spark a smile. There are always times to look back on; whether they are fond memories, or thoughts of nostalgia. I was about to graduate, and my parents had just broke the news to me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the year was finished. We had the date set; @DATE1, right after school was over. The first reaction out of my mouth was filled with entreatment, wishing for my best friend to join us on this trip. My parents took the time and thoughtfully considered all the advantages and disadvantages, and rapidly responded in the affirmative. I was thrilled to know that the memories I was about to create with my closest family members were now to include my best friend.  First thing was first, I had to get down to business. I needed to call my friend, @PERSON1, and ask her if she'd like to come along. Selfishly assuming that her immediate response would be an exuberant ""@CAPS1!,"" I was @CAPS4 first devastated when she postponed her response and didn'@CAPS6 seem too excited. I didn'@CAPS6 consider the fact that there @MONTH1 have been some sort of miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother, and gave me a call back. I had made the mistake of not telling her that we would have her financially covered for airfare, dining, and hotel rooms. We cleared everything up, and they decided she @CAPS3 join us. The two of us together couldn'@CAPS6 have been more ecstatic if we tried! @PERSON1 and I made a countdown board that started around two months from our departure date. There were many factors that we would take into hand while planning. As we measured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which landmarks, resorts, and shops we would visit. Our family friend lived in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4 the time, so she gave us a tour of the island. Having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more fun. She knew all the local hangout spots, and had access to the military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION1!  Many humorous occurrences happened often while we were on that vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened in the hotel while I was with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom has always had a way to make every situation hilarious, so it was a blast when we went out on a girls night. First, and most significant of our adventures, we went shopping in the mall that was attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of varied small clothing stores, food shops, and jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores that we visited was a @CAPS6-shirt shop with chocolate infused fabrics! We spent so much time looking @CAPS4 all of the designs, that I think we ended up carrying a wave of cocoa with us for the rest of the night.  As soon as we finished our shopping quest in the town center, we worked our way back up to the room, laughing and involved in pointless girl talk. The three of us girls shuffled with smiles, sore feet, and new bags onto the elegant, ornately designed golden elevator. My mother pushed the button to take us to our floor, while @PERSON1 carried on a story about plans we had the night before. Absorbed in conversation, we hauled our new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we didn'@CAPS6 have a key card to open our room's door, the three of us decided that we should just knock on the door and my father would answer. ""@CAPS2 was supposed to be back from renting our surf boards by now, so why isn'@CAPS6 @CAPS2 answering?"" we thought, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2 still be out on the beach?"" @CAPS4 this point our conversation died down a bit as we tried to figure out what to do. I sent a message to my dad's cell phone, and @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was in the room. We ended up pounding on the door for a good five minutes, assuming @CAPS2 was playing a joke on us by not answering. After waiting a few moments in confused silence, I began to notice a low buzzing voice coming from inside the room. I turned to my mother and best friend, and @CAPS3 barely keep from laughing. It was then that it hit me, and I said to both of them, ""@CAPS5 guys! We didn'@CAPS6 leave a @CAPS6.V. on!"" We immediately halted our intrusion, moved as quickly as we @CAPS3 away from the door, and continued to howl with laughter. My mother had hit the wrong floor button on the elevator! We were so absorbed in having a good time that we didn'@CAPS6 even realize we were bothering someone, and embarassing ourselves! It wasn'@CAPS6 just one moment or one trip, it is now a lifetime of joy because I can look back on those memories and smile @CAPS4 them. It's these moments that I treasure the most.",23.0,20.0,,43.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,":** The essay is clear, focused, and interesting.

20922,8," Emotions are an essential part of life. Some emotions bring tears and laughter, which alone are two powerful and essential things to life.

Which to those who don't know, it is a website where teens spend quite a lot of time on, and people can comunicate through this website. I log in and see that this girl I like is also signed in, so I start talking to her. The normal teenage conversation of, ""@CAPS2, whats up?"" that sort of thing happens, and then she asks if I am able to hang out. Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but most guys would go hang out if its a girl they like. I went to meet up with her at the library and as always, she was beautiful, even though I doubt she was trying. As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, yet when I asked what was bothering her, she did not wish to tell me. I didn't want to make things worse, so I left it alone. All I could thing about was what could I do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if it would help or not. To my luck, it actually helped, and she started smiling. After a little while, I had her laughing and having a good time. Since that day, we have been dating, and are really happy, and everyday when I see her I say something random to make her smile.",20.0,17.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20923,8,"            The Element of @CAPS1 and Laughter Laughter is an important element that a person could ever have when they are in a joyful or happy mood. Laughing is a good part in a persons life; it shows other people when you appreciate something that they did that put you in a good enough mood to share a laugh. Some people react in different ways when it comes to laughter because of their emotions; other people laugh to hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at peoples accidents while others don't. Emotions are a big deal in a persons life. Some emotions are joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear or anger. Being happy makes people want to laugh at something. Sometimes when people laugh too much, they will actually start crying from it. People like other people @CAPS4 are in a happy or joyful mood, because then they can receive those good feelings as well; therefore, it makes other people happy to get more people to be in a positive attitude as well.  Another thing that makes people laugh are jokes. Some jokes can be very funny, other jokes can be gross, and some jokes can be really hilarious that you will always remember them. But jokes can get complicated at times; to a little kid you can say, ""@CAPS2, @CAPS2!"" ""@CAPS4's there?"" ""@CAPS5."" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?"" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?, don't cry about it, it was just a joke,"" and the kid would be laughing. But to someone @CAPS4 is older, you have to think a little more to get them to laugh. People love laughter; they like laughing at peoples jokes and especially at hilarious pranks. Sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. Like you seeing a friend of yours get something that spits out garlic and them knowing that the person that is about to get pranked is alergic to garlic. But most of the time, funny things help people cheer up when they are down. Furthermore, accidents are some things that can be really horrible at some times, but at other times, some of the accidents that occur in life can be very hilarious to some people. Some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other. For example, a person might think that another person that is about to jump off of a diving board, but then slips and hits his back on the board is really funny and another person could disagree with that and take it in the opposite way and think that it was not funny at all. It is like when someone says that they a really funny joke or something hilarious to say, and you end up thinking that it was something that was bothersome or a tragedy or it could also be the other way around. You might think that you have something funny to say, but then to your friend it was something that really bothered them or something that they thought that wasn't funny at all. In other words, laughter is an important element that a person could ever have in their life. It is a part that a person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person. Enjoy having good times with friends to share a couple of laughs, don't just be in a grumpy mood all the time, be happy. Laughter is a good thing; people love it so don't always be serious and at least share some laughs with your friends or loved ones.",13.0,19.0,34.0,34.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20925,8," There was this time during @CAPS1 vacation, and their was a lot of snow o n the ground. My cousin @CAPS2, brother @CAPS3 and I were all getting together and going to go out to my grandparents. My brother @CAPS3 lives in @LOCATION2 and my cousin @CAPS2, and I live here in @LOCATION1. So it wasn't that hard trying to get us cousins all together. We were all getting together to go out to my grandparents and go snowmobiling together and stay the night out their for a couple of nights. When all got together, and were starting to go out there it was getting to late to go snowmobiling. We were all very kind of sad but it was okay. We just watched movies off direct @LOCATION3, and waited for the morning to come. Once morning came of course it was way to cold to go out right when we woke up. So we made a big breakfast and after breakfast we all got ready and than sat around until it was warmer to go outside. Finally it was the afternoon! We all got dressed into warm clothes to go out an go snowmobiling. We all went outside and my grandpa had one of the snowmobiles ready for us and behind it was the hood of a truck so he could pull us from behind with it. My grandpa was driving the snowmobile and us kids were in the back. My grandma only went one once with us and than she got off because my grandpa was going way to crazy n we were all getting hit by each other when he was driving. Then once us kids were the only ones on the hood by grandpa was starting to go really fast! I was the only one who was covered in snow, and i looked like a snowman. It was so funny! My grandpa went running inside to get my grandpas camera so she could take some pictures. It took her awhile to take them though because she is not that good or fast at taking pictures. Then when she was done we went back to snowmobiling for the rest of the day. After we got all done for the day I than really looked like a snowman. It was a fun day, and very funny how I looked as a snowman, but afterwords I got really cold. We went inside and I went right in front of the heater to warm up while my grandma was making hot chocolate for all of us.",18.0,12.0,30.0,30.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20926,8," We were heading to our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 sat, crammed together in our team van. Our packed bags and ski gear filled the vehicle to the top, along with six other kids, occupying all of the other empty spaces. Our uncomfortable seating arrangements didn't seem to ruin our fun, within five minutes of our road trip, the van exploded with laughter, as @PERSON1, most likely a future comedian started off cracking jokes, just being himself as usual. Within those first five minutes of our drive, I could already tell that this was going to be a ski trip I would always remember.  The van rolled up to the hotel parking lot. My ski team would be lodging here for the long weekend. The sky had turned black with the @TIME1, and me along with everyone else trudged along with weary eyes, exhausted from the long drive. We quickly unloaded our bags, all eager to hop into our beds, needing to be well rested for our first ski race of the season. Shortly after, everyone was soon in bed, knowing that five a.m. would be coming quickly. The sun began rising over the mountains, signaling time to wake up. This was not the case for me. I had been up for nearly an hour, and sat in our van while we sped around each corner up to the mountain. It was race day, and me, along with all of my teammates were all excited for the day coming. The morning flew by, collecting our bibs at registration, getting our lift tickets, and inspection of the course. I now stood at the top of the hill peering down at the course ahead of me. I had to focus. While I have had a lot of fun, it was time to concentrate, to preform my absolute best. The pressure was on. I now stood in the start gate, my coach stood by my side, and my friends were watching as well, cheering me on. I was hoping not to disappoint. ""@CAPS2 ready,"" the official began in a tense voice, ""@CAPS3!"" I threw my self our of the start gate. I flew by each gate, staying in control and most important, going fast. The wind slid past my aerodynamic body, my ankles and knees rolled with each turn. Everything was going well until I broke over the knoll. My body compressed bringing my knees to my chest, as I skied over the roller, throwing me off balance. I fought to get back up, to regain myself, but I couldn't do it. My skis spun out from under me, causing me to be spit out from the course, landing on my back, sliding down the mountain, hopeless and done for. It was over. I sat in the snow frustrated with my performance. I wanted a second chance that I wasn't going to get. @PERSON1, one of my teammates, came up to me and sat in the snow by my side. My first thought was he was going to say something of a cliche ""nice job,"" or a ""you'll do better next time"". To my surprise he tells me one of his ridiculous jokes. My mouth turns up, trying to contain a laugh, unsuccessful, I burst into laughter. @PERSON1 sits there and smiles at me. Almost immediately I found myself in a better mood. I give him a quick ""thanks,"" with a smile before we both @CAPS3 to watch and cheer on our teammates. Although I didn't do my best, I didn't let my results ruin my weekend. The next day, I skied two solid runs with top finishes, if I had stayed upset with myself, I would have never been able to achieve those results. I came to realize that some days, just a small laugh can be all you need to turn any day around. Laughter, I have found is essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, laughter changed my personality that day on the mountain. Laughter can mean many different things for many different people, laughter could be a special bond between to people. Laughter can remove the seriousness or competitively in a situation, but also it unites us. Languages are different among people, but everyone understands a what a laugh can do, a laugh is universal.",24.0,23.0,,47.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20927,8,"                                        The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter seems to be almost the basis of ones relationship with friends, with no laughter, there is no spark of interest of wanting to be someones friend. When I think of laughter, I think of the times when I go to @ORGANIZATION1. Even @CAPS2 I have had the most horrible day, I know that the girls I play with on that team, who are like a second family to me, can always cheer me up by the things they say or do. The underlying relationship between a @ORGANIZATION1 team becomes unknown to the outside; no one really knows how much we laugh together, or how much frustration builds up between us. Frustration @MONTH1 get the best of us sometimes but I can think of a lot more memories where I was laying on the turf field laughing because a dumb decision of a player, turns into on of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I remember the first time I had a @ORGANIZATION1 practice, back in @DATE1 of second grade, I was playing with many girls who had gone to a different school and I had never seen before. All of the girls decided that they wanted to see who was the best at juggling a @ORGANIZATION1 ball on there knees. It came my turn to try, and as i went to bump it with my knee, it hit in the wrong spot so it came back up and hit me in the nose, leaving it bloody. I had no idea how to react, so I started to laugh. At the time, a girl I had never seen before started to laugh with me, and came up and gave me a tissue. Believe it or not the girl who gave me a tissue that first day became my best friend, and has been ever since. The laughter that occurred that day filled the gap of distance between us. Since that day we have never had an awkward silence wondering what we should say or do.   Entering the fall of fourth grade, I had just joined the @ORGANIZATION1 team @ORGANIZATION1, still playing with the same girls, with the exception of a few people. I had no idea what to think of those people or what to say, so i decided on not saying anything. We had been playing monkey in the middle and I was guarding a short blond girl named @CAPS3, who had extremely good talents but was a little clumsy. She had started to run for the ball, and low and behold the clumsy girl tripped on nothing! Thoughts were racing through my mind; should I laugh? Will she hate me @CAPS2 I do? What @CAPS2 she's actually hurt? Though these thoughts @MONTH1 become reality, I went with my instinct and burst with laughter. She rolled over to see who had starting laughing at her accidental trip, and started laughing as well. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing we had gone to the same school but never associated with one another. From that day on we became inseparable at school, and became best friends.  The next story has nothing to do with @ORGANIZATION1, but everything to do with laughter. Though there is no certain story that I could tell you in particular that happened between this girl and I, all I can say is she is the one who gave me the first experience of laughing until you cry. I remember her moving to our school, and I was no longer the ""new girl"". At first, I thought she was the weirdest person that I had ever met, but as time progressed I had come to find out that she @MONTH1 be one of the funniest people I have ever met. @CAPS2 I would have made the realization beforehand that this girl had the personality she did, I would have went up to her in a heartbeat and made friends, instead of hiding behind the crowd. Ever since we became friends our friendship has been based upon how much we laugh together, and I wouldn't have it an other way. In the end the person who once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", was absolutely correct. I used these stories above to show no matter how shy, or awkward a person @MONTH1 be, sharing a laugh with a new person is the easiest way to find a best friend. When I was introduced to laughter by these three people, I started to become more social throughout my middle school years, and now onto my high school career as well. @CAPS2 I lived a life without laughter, I would lose the life I have, and it would be filled with dull memories that are not worth sharing, and to me, that is definitely not worth it. Over the past six years, I have gained three best friends due to laughter, this really does go to show that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and is truly a @CAPS1 to have it.",20.0,16.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20928,8," Laughter is a daily part of my life. I'm always laughing in school or at home. With laughter you can show many emotions that can't be told with words. To me, it's also a way of showing how fortunate your life is. I've had numerous occasions where laughter was the solution to my problem. I also agree that laughter is an important part of a relationship. In then next paragraphs, I am going to talk about how laughter affects my relationship and the benefits it brings to it as well. Approximately three months ago my family and I decided to take a trip to @LOCATION2. We planned to stay there for a month or so. When I told my boyfriend that I'd be gone for a month, right away I saw the sadness in his eyes. This truly killed me however, our decision was made and there was no turning back.  Our relation was tense during that month. We talked a few times but his voice was different. There was a sadness to it and I knew something was wrong. Although he said everything was good I knew his sadness was due to my absence.  After the month had finally ended it was time to come back to @LOCATION3! I was truly excited. We arrived at @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 at @TIME1 on a @DATE1 @TIME2. I immediately called him but there was no chance of seeing him that same @TIME2. Although, just knowing that I was closer to him made me happy and anxious. We conversed for endless hours, telling each other that we would never be that far again. We laughed and laughed during our whole conversation. To me the sound of his laughter was a sign of his happiness and that was just priceless. The laughter was as if it had been a blessing to our relation. From that day on forward, I realized how much laughter really affects me in numerous ways. It's as if it brings happiness and prosperity to my life. With just a laugh sadness leaves and that's when happiness jumps in.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20930,8,"                             Living, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter     @CAPS4 to this @DATE1 I don't remember exactly why I was laughing. All I can remember, vividly, in my mind is the look on my grandfathers face. He had on the same smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a wide warm grin he would shine your way every so often. As I laughed uncontrollably that @DATE1, so many years ago, he shined his happiness @CAPS1 love down on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his grin. My @CAPS16, who we all called @CAPS5, had a way of keeping the peace @CAPS1 happiness in everything. No matter how bad things were within our family, he would always make things right. No one could get angry @CAPS3 @CAPS5, @CAPS1 no one could stay sad when he smiled. That's just the kind of guy he was. @CAPS5 was a big part of our family gatherings, just like the one we had on my @DATE1 @DATE1 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. That @DATE1 was our family's @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5, soon after, he passed away. When I look back @CAPS1 realize how important that @DATE1 was I can see that it was a perfect @CAPS8 for everyone. It was a happy @DATE1 @CAPS1 my @DATE1 memories of my @CAPS16 were of his great big happy grin shining down on me while I giggled away during a card game.     When that @CAPS8 kicked off, in the early morning, the weather was already proving to be spectacular. Every one in my family was in high spirits @CAPS1 was ready to enjoy the @DATE1 @CAPS3 family. My favorite activity during each @CAPS1 every family event is to play my favorite games @CAPS3 everyone. Our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is called @CAPS12-@CAPS13. Now @CAPS12-@CAPS13 was one of the many games that my @CAPS16 was very good at playing. He rarely ever lost a game, @CAPS1 would not finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was assembled at our house, I convinced @CAPS5 @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON1 to play @CAPS12-@CAPS13 @CAPS3 me. We went into the spare room @CAPS1 starting dealing out the cards. About a half an hour later we were still playing, @CAPS1 to no ones surprise, @CAPS5 was winning. It was just before the food was ready @CAPS1 we were about halfway through the game when either my cousin @PERSON1, or @CAPS5 said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing my tiny @NUM1 year old ears had ever heard, @CAPS1 I began to laugh.     My family was so thoroughly entertained @CAPS3 my laughter that they could not keep their smiles @CAPS1 laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine. It seemed that my senseless laughing created instant joy to my family, including my @CAPS16. @CAPS5' smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood. It was something so imaginary, yet so colorful @CAPS1 vivid in front of me,that I would worship his smile like I was seeing my first solar eclipse. I never quite understood, at such a young age what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do understand. @CAPS5' smile showed true, wholesome, unbreakable joy. His smile didn't come out all too often so when it did, you knew something good was happening.    No one knew that was our @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. I most certainly could not imagine it to be the @DATE1 I would spend @CAPS3 my @CAPS16. Everything was so perfect @CAPS1 so increasingly happy, it seemed to be a crime to end his life during such a time of joy. Although if I were him, @CAPS1 if I had to choose my @DATE1 @CAPS8, that @DATE1 would be perfect. My single memory of that @DATE1 was laughing, @CAPS1 being happy. I can't think of any better way to spend my @DATE1 bit a time @CAPS3 @CAPS5 then a @DATE1 where we were both completely satisfied in our card game, laughter, @CAPS1 smiles.    Laughter is a funny thing. It is unique in every person, @CAPS1 can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope in times of doubt @CAPS1 never fails to make someone smile. Someone, somewhere started a quote that says, ""@CAPS25. Laugh. Love."" I believe those three words can combine together, @CAPS1 act separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone willing to @CAPS25 out the true, meaningful definition of each of those words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, @CAPS1 love. Love brings us all together, @CAPS1 when we strive to be happy @CAPS1 to love, that is when we can truly @CAPS25. My grandfather loved each @CAPS1 every one of his family @CAPS1 friends @CAPS1 made a priority of keeping them happy. He lived his life the best way that I believe anyone could ever @CAPS25 it. He died after a life full of love happiness @CAPS1, most importantly, the very special gift of laughter.

20931,8," Some people say that laughter is good for the soul, and that could be true, but the soul is definitely not the only thing. Laughing is great for your heart and mind too. It can improve relationships, make friendships grow stronger, and even start @CAPS5 make two people who don't know anything about each other, extremely close. You can meet someone new or be with someone you barely know, and just because they make you laugh you feel like you want @CAPS5 get @CAPS5 know them better. I love that feeling. Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both have @CAPS5 be @NUM1 and female, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. Last @DATE1 I never had anything @CAPS5 do, so I decided I should start volunteering places. The two places I could volunteer at were: a daycare next @CAPS5 my house, or an old folks home about @NUM2 miles away. I thought really hard about it, trying @CAPS5 make the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided I should do both of them, so I could meet some new people, and have new experiences. I started with the daycare. I woke up at @NUM3 am, and walked @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION1. I wasn't sure what it was going @CAPS5 be like at all. I didn't even know if i was good with kids. I walked in, and stood @CAPS3 awkwardly. The @ORGANIZATION1 manager came up @CAPS5 me and asked me if i could help out with the @NUM4 year old's coloring room. I nodded my head nervously.  Was i supposed @CAPS5 color for them? @CAPS3's no way they could color a picture by themselves. They're only three! I thought. Oh well, if i follow directions then this day will get @CAPS2 faster. When i went in @CAPS3 all the kids ran up @CAPS5 me with a smile on their face. ""@CAPS1 by me!"" one said. ""@CAPS2 here!"" said another. ""@CAPS3's a spot right here!"" ""@CAPS4 at my picture!"" ""I drew a rainbow!"" ""I drew a car!"" ""I drew you!"" @CAPS5 that, i looked down. @CAPS3 i was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I was laughing and having a great time with the kids. I learned that i absolutely adore kids, and I'm actually pretty good with them. The next week a went @CAPS5 the nursing home. I was even more nervous @CAPS3. I felt so out of place. I hadn't found out what I was going @CAPS5 be helping with yet, so I sat on a chair in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who i was her @CAPS5 see, i said nobody. She then asked me why I was here, and I replied, oh, I was going @CAPS5 volunteer. She led me down the hall told me that it was almost time for lunch so i needed @CAPS5 get ready @CAPS5 serve lunch. I did, and then the i heard, what i assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was honestly great. If one of them looked a little down, or upset I could flash them a smile and they would grin back, obviously in higher spirits than before. After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most people who were @CAPS3 took naps after lunch, so @CAPS3 were only three people out @CAPS3. I played first with a lady who used @CAPS5 be a nurse. I got @CAPS5 know her pretty well in the half hour we played the game; which i won. Next was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the @LOCATION1 war. He seemed really nice, but serious. I won that game too. The last man used @CAPS5 be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few @CAPS5 many, because he beat me at chess. Well that was my excuse. When i got done, i was in a great mod and i could't wait @CAPS5 come back again. I learned a lot that @DATE1. I found out everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized you don't have @CAPS5 be the same as the person your with, @CAPS5 laugh and have a good time. It doesn't matter what age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying @CAPS5 make the best of your day. I am so glad i decided @CAPS5 volunteer, otherwise i would have never known so much about people, love, life, and laughter.",20.0,21.0,,41.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

**Sentence"
20932,8," Looking back on my early childhood, one thing that stands out bright and shiny in my memory is laughter. Since birth, I have always loved to smile and laugh. I've found a kind of comfort, peace, and confidence through laughter alone, which I doubt I would have been able to find somewhere else naturally. This could, in part, be because of my @CAPS1. We rarely get to see each other because he lives in @LOCATION2 and I live in @LOCATION3, but when we do have the luxury of spending time together, it is always full of laughter, and full of joy. I credit him for giving my my love for laughter. I've been told by my parents that as a baby all my @CAPS1 had to do was laugh, and my eyes brightened and a smile became apparent as wide as the @LOCATION1 on my face. It's been that way ever since. One of my earliest memories I have is laying on my parent's bed listening to my @CAPS1 tell me jokes. Every time he finished I would erupt in laughter, and, at the sight of me laughing, he would burst out too. The important detail to note is, when my @CAPS1 laughs, his belly shakes violently like @ORGANIZATION1. I found this the greatest part of the jokes. Once his belly started bouncing up and down, my laughter became uncontrollable. Our laughter escalated until tears were streaming down our faces. Besides having a belly that bounces when he laughs, my @CAPS1 has one of the most distinctive and contagious laughs one has ever been lucky enough to hear. It's one of those fabulous and enriching laughs which words do not do justice, but once you hear it, you won't ever forget it. His laughter can light up the darkest room in a house. For me, his laugh almost has medicinal healing. Whenever I hear my @CAPS1 laugh, for just a moment, the world stops, and everything within is okay. I am not the only one who has a great appreciation for my @CAPS1's laugh. My father and him both have a love for telling jokes, which I have observed over the years, is one of the few items they hold a common agreement on. Everything from politics, to religion, to who should pay for dinner, usually ends in an argument between them. Because of that, they tend to stay clear of those topics for fear of confrontation. They have never mentioned this, but from my observation over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the laughter they share so often, acts as the glue which keeps their relationship strong. Were it not for laughter, I sometimes wonder if they would still have a working, loving relationship. I will forever be thankful for the great gift my @CAPS1 unknowingly gave me at such a young age. He created a deep and passionate love for laughter inside me, which has gotten me through the roughest times. I truly believe that laughter heals the soul and that when two people share a laugh, they are bonded for a moment in a precious, fragile, and sacred way. My day can be going horribly, and in the instant that a joke is cracked, and laughter overwhelms my body, everything brightens and the worries and stresses of my day seem so minute. Finding humor in every situation is another lesson that my @CAPS1 taught me. If you can find humor, you can find serenity in the most disastrous moments. Laughter, to me, is somewhat like a drug. It's a harmless, enriching, and life-saving drug which I can proudly say I hope to be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my @CAPS1.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,":**

20933,8,"Laughter is such a marvelous element to have in any relationship. For instance if you can't find any form of humor in a relationship than I'm pretty sure there is no strong connection between the two of you. For example I was in a relationship once where we didn't have that element of humor, and I truthfully did not enjoy that relationship that her and I had. Any type of relationship needs laughter rather its friendships, boyfriend or girlfriends, and even family. All different types of relationships need some form of humor to survive. Sometimes families don't have that humor for each other but they'll still have that special type of a friendship, the reason for that I believe is because your family will always be there for you unlike most friends would. One way I know this because one of my friends really liked a guy, I could have sworn she @MONTH1 have even loved him, when he told her that he started dating some girl, she had cried for weeks, than when she was at her moms house one of her brothers she believed hated her said he wants to hurt the guy that had made his younger sister cry. They @MONTH1 not of had a humorous friendship, or even a friendship at all, but I believe laughter isn't necessarily always needed especially within family. All types of relationships are like plants, the flower is the relationship and laughter is the water that will help the relationship grow big and strong. But without that water the plant wont grow, just like laughter in a relationship. I know that if I knew someone who I did not find to be humorous I know our friendship would not be very strong, unlike someone who I felt was hilarious. Laughter is always a important element in everyday life. For instance if you are going for a job interview you really need to connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression for yourself. One way of doing that is through laughter, I have heard of many stories about job interviews, a example of one is my mom had a interview not to long ago for a @CAPS1 job and she told me about her interview and she said they had really connected. Their was also some seriousness and some laughter in that interview than three days later they emailed her and told her that she got the job and that they would love to hire her. and I have heard of interviews where they didn't get the job. My sister had a interview once for a pet kennel type of place where they drop their pets off there while they go on vacation, and she said that her and the person interviewing her had no connection which had led to no humor or laughter. So I believe humor is such a marvelous element to have within a relationship because with laughter comes greatness and happiness.",17.0,15.0,,32.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20935,8," Laughter is key. You never really think about laughter in importance, but the truth is, laughing brings the most opposite people together. Last year, I met one of my brothers friends in school. We never really talked but she seemed nice. We had a class together and we started talking more and more everyday and she was best friends with my best friend.  @PERSON1 was her name and she drove a bright orange @ORGANIZATION1. We hung out after school one day and I leaned the passenger seat all the way back and was sitting on it like a dog and she slammed on the brakes and I flew into the front of the vehicle and I couldn't stop laughing. At that moment I knew we were going to be friends. I was a freshman so I didn't really know anyone and she was always nice to everyone so we started hanging out more. I lived about @NUM1 miles out of town and her brothers went to school about @NUM2 miles past my house so we had to go pick them up. We bought a game called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' and there are tons of little jellbeans that were flavored like vomit, centipede, dirt, rotten egg, etc.. So we were playing while we were driving out there and @CAPS3 had to stop the car nearly @NUM3 times in our @NUM4 mile drive! Those were the nastiest beans ever! Then, we would drive out to my house and we'd listen to our favorite country songs and blast them in her car. She was my ultimate best friend and no one could replace her. Whenever we would get in fights we wouldn't start drama, we'd always have an actual fight because by the time one of us were pinned the other was laughing too hard to do anything about it. Her dad and my dad became friends later on too and we would always have barbeque's and family get togethers.  We also talked in a @CAPS4 accent all the time because one of our friends was from @LOCATION1. Whenever we went to @CAPS5 to go shopping we'd use our accent and everywhere we went people would ask us where we were from. Before we knew it our dads started talking like us. We also created a bunch of slang words and then the whole school started using them. She is a great friend and she keeps me laughing everyday. Whenever @PERSON1 was having problems with her family she knew she could always talk to me and I would always be there for her. She always called me sister instead of @CAPS6 because we were so close. She used to take @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 classes at my old high school and when she got the fake baby doll it would keep us up late into the @TIME1, that baby was crazy. @PERSON1 would be driving and the baby would start screaming in its car seat and we'd have to pull over and find out what was wrong with it. She'd be a good mom. She always cared for things, even the smallest little thing she would cherish.  One time, we painted her little brothers room because we were bored and @PERSON1 was rolling her paintbrush in paint and texting and she took her eye off of her phone and dropped it in the paint. She couldn't find it for like @NUM5 minutes and by the time she did find it it was totally covered in green paint! I laughed at her for so long and those are the moments I wish I could bring back.  Everytime we hung out I would laugh and I realize now how important that laughter is to me. About six months ago I moved to a whole different state and I don't see her very often. There is no one like @PERSON1. She could make me laugh and was always just @NUM5 minutes away when I needed something, now I have to drive about @NUM2 hours to even see her. I haven't laughed like she made me ever since I went back to visit. Laughter is key, as I stated before and if you frown, you'll never know who is falling in love with your smile.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20936,8," A few years ago, when I was @NUM1, I decided to do an experiment on laughing and the color of the clothes people wear. I realized that I laughed a lot and I was almost always happy because of @CAPS11, I did really @CAPS1 in school, and I also had a very 'up' attitude. @CAPS6 clothes were all very bright and 'happy' colors. I had a theory that the less someone laughed, and the darker colored clothes they wore, would make their mood and attitude would dip. The experiment would last one week, and in that time I would try @CAPS7 to laugh and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I got to black, to see how I would be affected, if affected at all. To get started, I had to first tell everyone what I was doing and ask them to try @CAPS7 to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colors on them. That was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were too colorful. After that i only had to wait for the @DATE2 to end and @DATE3 to begin. @DATE3 @TIME1 I woke up and did @CAPS6 usual daily routine, then tried on @CAPS6 new clothes. When I got to school, I noticed the surprised looks from @CAPS6 classmates @CAPS2 they took in @CAPS6 outfit. @CAPS11 was pretty tough @CAPS7 to laugh at some of their expressions but I couldn't, because that would ruin what I was trying to accomplish. Throughout the day, I got comments on @CAPS6 clothing, and some of @CAPS6 teachers were worried because I wasn't laughing @CAPS2 usual but when I told them of @CAPS6 experiment, they understood and said, ""@CAPS1 luck."" @CAPS2 the day came to an end, I was satisfied with @CAPS6 success and quickly fell asleep. The next two days went pretty much the same, and I was wondering if @CAPS6 theory would be proven wrong. But on @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS6 mom pointed out that I seemed different.  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 okay?"" she asked. ""@CAPS4 don't seem @CAPS2 energetic @TIME1, and your @CAPS7 smiling at all. Your @CAPS7 sick @CAPS3 @CAPS4?"" I told her that I was fine. At school, I was asked the same thing, and after a while @CAPS11 got really annoying. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do, and they apologized. But I felt bad and told them I was sorry and they forgave me, telling me @CAPS11 was probably just the experiment. I got a little happier at the thought that @CAPS6 theory might just be correct. That day went by slowly, and I was glad when @CAPS11 ended. @DATE4 was the last day of @CAPS6 experiment and for that I was happy. I didn't mind the dark clothes and I liked the way they looked on me, but @CAPS11 was hard @CAPS7 laughing, and @CAPS11 was starting to make me feel depressed. That day I decided to wear some of @CAPS6 bright clothes to see if @CAPS11 would change anything, and when I got to school some of @CAPS6 friends didn't recognize me because they got used to seeing me in @CAPS6 other clothes. I didn't feel any different from when I wore @CAPS6 dark clothes. In @CAPS5 I had to stand in front of the class to give @CAPS6 conclusion. ""@CAPS6 theory has been proven semi-correct,"" I stated. ""@CAPS7 laughing did have an effect on @CAPS6 mood and attitude. I was yelling at @CAPS6 friends and feeling sad when I shouldn't have. But I found that wearing dark clothing didn't change anything."" @CAPS6 teacher then said something so funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and everyone applauded and said, ""@CAPS9 back @CAPS10!"" @CAPS11 feels really @CAPS1 to laugh again.",18.0,20.0,44.0,44.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,,,":**

I can go to her any time an ask her for help. I can go an talk to her any time I need to now. Be for we had a great relationship she wasn't doing to good she was involved in not to good of things. She was very depressed too. Ill tell you a little about it.   My day started off as a normal school day, I got up got ready, got on thus to school then be for I new it I was on the bus on my way home. I get off a block or two away from my house and then I walk home. I walk and walk, an about ten minutes later I get up to my house. I go to my room an put my bags down on my bed and go say hi to my mom. I walk into her room an shes sitting their in a chair. I had asked her if she wanted to go on a walk. Well of course she said yes.She gets her shoes on an I do the same.We walk down are drive way an that's where the walk starts.        We started walking down the road after we got to the end of are drive way. We walked straight for about five minutes, then take a right.We walk that way for about ten minutes an turn left. Their is a little store on that coroner. We stopped their to buy some water an some snacks on the walk. After we get done we start walking east on the road. When I looked back at my mom she look like she was having a really bad day. Like anyone i asked her what was wrong. She talked to me about everything and she seemed really sad, and depressed. From that I knew i need to talk to her an make her laugh. We never had the best relationship because she was always gone hanging out with friends. I knew if i could make her laugh, an help her get better, it would help us get along better an help each other out in the long run. I love my mom an I hate seeing people down. I though all this in my head. Being around me makes everyone laugh.  The walk was about three to four miles long. for the rest of the time I got her to laugh an laugh the whole way back. It made her feel a lot better i know that. Later that day she came in my room and we played some bored games and watch a movie or two. We really just talked and hung out for the rest of the day. We went on a couple more walks for the next month or two and we got a good mother an son relationship. We were both happy this had happened. About two months from the first walk w had she came up to me and hugged me and told me thank you for helping her out with what she was going though. I think laughter is a great thing in life. For me it helped me out a lot in life an it helped me save a relationship with my mom. I love laughing, and I love making people laugh it is fun to laugh an fun to make people laugh. Laughter makes great friendships. It can have a lot to do with your life. I hope this helps you laugh more and makes you try to be funny an have people laugh with you.

20940,8," A few years back me and my dad were siting at home watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they came inside they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door, finally my sister shut the door but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know, he was running so fast and before he knew it he was going fast first into a sliding glass door!  My dad and I were laughing so hard i almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door and without a doubt it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep and his cat was laying next to him, my dad kind of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started watching @CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping and took an advantage over it and slammed his hands on the chair. It scared the cat and it jumped about two feet into the air, Once again we started laughing really hard but this time my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 on about @DATE1 my dad my bother and I were working in our garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends and so i did. He flipped the switch and next thing i know i was being electrocuted. We all started laughing once again. Next it was my brothers turn but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself, when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tensed up and left him @CAPS4-able to free himself from a nine volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears cause it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocking ourselves we came up with the idea to put it on our tongues, i tried it first and my tongue started pulsing like a beating heart. My dad couldn't keep himself together long enough to keep holding the button. As a result to all these great funny times we had our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away , and @PERSON1 moved. In better words funny times @MONTH1 be in the past but there always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces..

20942,8,"A @ORGANIZATION1 is a wondrous gift. It allows your mind and your body to conjoin with others. It is the root of happiness, and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. When you feel alone in the world with no one at your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life I felt confused and by myself. I was empty. Solitude was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I had thought that I @MONTH1 be the only person in the whole world, something had come to save me.  I was six years old when they got divorced. I couldn't stand to hear my parents fight. One day we were the perfect family. We would play board games and go to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My @CAPS1 grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me and then he was gone. Was I ever going to see him again? Why isn't @CAPS1 living with us? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think i was too young to truly know what was going on. The days were long and I found myself becoming sluggish and glum.  About two weeks after my @CAPS1 had left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of the new people in town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever, and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike and thought that I should stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell over. I heard a laugh and turned around. It was the new neighbor kid. There he was rolling on the ground, grabbing at his sides. He must have thought of my crash as entertainment. I picked up my bike, began to move, then crashed once more. Another series of laughs sprang from this boy. That was the first time I had smiled in a long time. I grew fond of whatever feeling or humor I was giving off to this new kid. I asked the boy his name and he didn't respond; though he did start to laugh again. It was my voice that he was laughing at. Everything I did caused him to become hysterical. I found out later that he was from @LOCATION1 and didn't speak a word of @CAPS2. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start to my new beginning. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I am always reminded of him when I hear a laugh. Though he's not near me in a physical sense, I am guided by his laughter every day.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20943,8,"Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS4 had medicine @CAPS2 all @CAPS34 I think the best @CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @CAPS27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well so @CAPS4 went upstairs @CAPS2 started on her big book of word-searches. @CAPS27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for @CAPS19 two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS27 step-brother was on @CAPS27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on @CAPS22 @CAPS2 we started playing. A few minutes later @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 step-sister, @CAPS2 @PERSON1, @CAPS27 step-brother, decided to @CAPS46 with them. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 mom if @CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left @CAPS2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS4 was going her word-search @CAPS2 I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search @CAPS34 we did several. Since @CAPS4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom said, ""@CAPS1 me?"" @CAPS2 I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search @CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called ""@CAPS3."" @CAPS4 took the book @CAPS2 looked over the list @CAPS2 suddenly said ""@CAPS5-winks! Yeah!"" @CAPS2 I looked at her like @CAPS4 was crazy. Which @CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again @CAPS2 I start laughing really hard @CAPS2 ask, ""@CAPS7's @CAPS8?"" I was saying it wrong @CAPS34 when @CAPS24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  ""@CAPS7?"" @CAPS4 asked @CAPS2 I showed it to her. ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13."" @CAPS4 said @CAPS2 we started laughing. ""That sounds like something the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say."" I comment @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom does the little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. @CAPS34 we did. The next one I think was called ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21"" @CAPS22 were several things on @CAPS22 we didn't know. I asked her @CAPS7 one was @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like, ""I don't know."" @CAPS2 then I asked her another. ""@CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know."" @CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny @CAPS34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word ""ear"" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. @CAPS34 ""earring"" was. We ended up finding ""hair"" at the end of the ""ear"" I'd circled. ""@CAPS26 thanks for that picture."" @CAPS27 mom said. ""@CAPS7? Ear-hair?"" I asked @CAPS2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto ""@CAPS29"". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was ""@CAPS30"" @CAPS2 I laughed @CAPS2 said ""@CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, nice @CAPS30.'"" I said in a weird voice. ""'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'"" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard.  ""@CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS20 head."" I said before laughing again. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 walked in the room @CAPS2 looked at us like '@CAPS7 the heck?' @CAPS2 I showed her the word-search. ""@CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy."" @CAPS4 said, laughing as well. @CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS39, it's things that wear hats."" @CAPS4 managed to get out @CAPS2 I'm looking at her. ""@CAPS7 kind of a hat does a @CAPS30 wear?"" I asked, smirking. @CAPS4 shook her head. ""I don't know."" @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 was giving up. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 then said good-bye @CAPS2 left. ""@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills."" I snorted at @CAPS7 @CAPS4 said. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills."" @CAPS4 looks at me like @CAPS4 was going to punch me. @CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. ""@CAPS46 away."" @CAPS4 said with a smile. ""@CAPS48."" I said before turning @CAPS2 walking back to @CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that @CAPS24 kind of had to be @CAPS22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its @CAPS49.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,12,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20944,8,"                  The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This @CAPS2 started out like any other @CAPS2. Me waking up thinking what am I going to do. So I walk out of my room, ask my mom if we have any plans. She says that we don't have any plans. So after I talked to her some more. I went back into my room and there I saw that I had gotten a text message from my @CAPS1 friend @PERSON3. He asked if I wanted hang out with him. I decided of course I can because I had no family plans. ""I would love to hang out with you @PERSON3"".  @PERSON3 and I met at the @NUM1 bus stop on royal and we went to @ORGANIZATION2. See now the reason why we went to @ORGANIZATION2 was because the @CAPS2 before I had gotten a gift card from my grandmother and fifty dollars from @CAPS4 (@CAPS4 is my biological father). When we finally got to @ORGANIZATION2 asked me what are we going to get here. I said anything I want. him start busting up laughing. I bot a jackass shirt and some food. From @ORGANIZATION2 we went to @CAPS6 @CAPS7 to get some delicious food.  When we walked into the restaurant, the aroma from the place made us drool a little bit. @PERSON3 got a big bowl and stuffed @CAPS15 with everything he could. We ate so much. I ganged like ten pounds. We talked about life and how awesome the food was. Where we were going next was still undecided. We finally finished our food. I payed for the to bowls of food and we went to our bus stop and went to downtown @PERSON1. While we were on the bus @PERSON3 decided that we shall go to @ORGANIZATION1.  So we got off the bus and what do you know my friends @CAPS8 boy, @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 were downtown chill en like a villain. @PERSON3 went and smoked a cigarette. While I went and checked the bus schedule for the @ORGANIZATION4 bus. Him and I had to wait for @NUM2 minutes. So we gust hung out with our friends. @CAPS9 is the funniest guy @CAPS3. I laughed until I started to cry. I almost pissed myself.  We left to go get on the bus, laughed some more. When we got to the @ORGANIZATION4 we had know idea why we even went there. So we just walked around. @PERSON3 decided that we should into the photo booth to make this @CAPS2 legit. I had a lot of fun getting our picture taken. Next place we went was @CAPS11-topic. I love that store. We were in there for @CAPS3.  About two or so hours pass.  At the @ORGANIZATION4 there is this park that you can go to but you have to cross the bridge to get to @CAPS15. @PERSON3 and I got bored and went on an epic adventure to this park. There was a couple trails that we walked. I tripped on a branch. @PERSON3 laughed at me. We found this piece of concrete. @PERSON3 and I put on some music and danced to @CAPS12 @CAPS13. I love @CAPS14 music its really fun to dance to. I had orange soda that @PERSON3 drank. I took a lot of pictures of him drinking the soda. We pretended that the grass was lava and the concrete was a place for break dancing in cave man days. I took a video of @PERSON3 dancing and laughing to the song @CAPS15's the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 by sponge bob. He also ate all of my chips that i bot at @ORGANIZATION2. After that we went back onto the trails and skipped through the tree's. I trow skittles at birds and old people. While telling them to taste the rainbow.  We finally realized that we needed to get back home so him and I started walking back to the bus stop. Missed the first bus the caught the next one. Hung out downtown for an hour. Chilled with my downtown friends at @NUM3 park. Got a donut from @ORGANIZATION3. That place is epicly bad ass! Got some intents from this cool store by the station.

20946,8," Human beings are...unusual...Okay, we're weird. There are so many people in the world, including ourselves, and the only way we can like ourselves is if we can get others to like us; if that isn't strange enough, we still don't like ourselves no matter who likes us. Just what are we thinking? We are always using relationships to assist our understanding of who we are; it's a gamble to even have those relationships. Face the facts, we risk so much on relying on others; we give them the ability to build us...or break us. Our major goals as youngsters is to find people to like us. I think it might even span to later times in life than that! From my experiences I know there are two key points in knowing a person can build us: trust and kindness. Finding builders with these traits is as easy as understanding if they bring you joy or not.  A person can give you joy by simply being kind to you...but if you want a whole swarm of friends, then this isn't exactly the best way. It's not that kindness is a bad way to make friends...it's just that it's not the fastest method. If a builder is kind then of course you would become their friend...in time; in order to immediately know a friend when you see one, they will make you laugh. Laughter makes us enjoy our time with our friends, it's a golden rule in the book of @CAPS1, if there is such a book. And it was through laughter that I made my experience in @CAPS2 class better. @CAPS2 class, to me, was extremely stressful. Every day we had either a speaking assignment or we had paperwork; and the class was really slow. Why was it slow? It was slow because we could hardly get through one set of instructions without some group speaking or finding some other way to disturb the class. A good example would be this one class project we had to do. As usual, instructions were slow; I was at my boiling point. Today seemed different though, despite the the usual annoyance, not a single student asked for a repeat on instructions, in fact, they all seemed to understand and immediately started working. I too followed in with this action. The assignment was, each group of about three to four people had to create a script using the vocabulary learned from the supplied booklet; it took a whole class period and then everyone went home to do their other work. The next day we returned to @CAPS2 was definitely an interesting one. The teacher had all kinds of strange props lined up for us. apparently we were going to have the audience act out our script, our job was to read it out loud. My group was first to entertain and we had finally selected our volunteers and actors. Tiffany, @PERSON1, and I sat down in the back of the classroom ready to read the script, not sure what the actors would deliver. Our play was... a success?! By the end of the first sentence everyone was giggling. As we moved further on to the next play the laughter had grew louder. Students were really enjoying themselves and more people volunteered to preform until it was difficult to choose actors. Even I, the classroom-snob, was enjoying myself. The plays were fun and random, some play would send everyone into hysterics. I can easily remember one of the groups making me laugh so hard that my sides were aching, tears lined my lids, and it was almost impossible to breathe. This project was definitely the best one I had ever participated in. It's moments like these when we build strong unity in the classroom, we enjoyed all of the people around us and we enjoyed ourselves. I was so use to being angery at my classmates that I was taken by suprise on that one day. Enjoying their plays so much, I now look at them as an entertaining group of students, rather that the annoyance I had seen them as before. No longer are these people strangers in the hallway, now they are family. It really is amazing how something as simple as laughter can change ones outlook on others and themselves.",20.0,23.0,,43.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20947,8,"                                  The @CAPS1 of Laughter  @CAPS2 would we be without laughter? Would we still have relationships/friendships like we do @CAPS5? Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS17 life would not be the same as it is @CAPS5. Without laughter, @CAPS17 @DATE1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE1 vacation @CAPS17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS14 name it, we did it. @CAPS12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS17 closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over.  ""@CAPS3 @PERSON5,"" I began, ""@PERSON2 and I found these shorts @TIME1, and thought that @CAPS14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top."" ""@CAPS4! Thanks guys, they fit great!"" @PERSON5 screamed as @CAPS12 filled with excitement. ""@CAPS5 let's go to the mall!"" @CAPS6 about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw @CAPS17 phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7 face was priceless. I wish I had had @CAPS17 camera.  We had never seen @PERSON5 so mad. @CAPS12 was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON2 and I were still @CAPS9 @CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS10 someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people @CAPS10 the mall?  ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11,"" @CAPS12 screamed. ""@PERSON4 saw @CAPS13, and @CAPS14're @CAPS9? He's never going to talk to @CAPS11 again. I hate @CAPS14 guys!""  ""@CAPS14 don't hate us. That was hysterical and @CAPS14 know it,"" chimed @PERSON2. ""@CAPS15 like we embarrassed @CAPS14 pretty good, huh?"" ""@CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock,"" I giggled as @PERSON2 and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later @PERSON5 began to crack up @CAPS9, and apologized for freaking out @CAPS6 realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, @CAPS12 was planning to get us back. By the end of @DATE1 break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We all had a gut @CAPS1 that this was going to be the best one yet.  Everyone was having a blast @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was @CAPS10 the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo @CAPS17 bikini top, and pull @CAPS19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do @CAPS14 have any experiences @CAPS2 laughter brought @CAPS14 and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?

20948,8," During the @CAPS1 break my family went to @LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were head to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for @CAPS1 break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. @DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. ""@CAPS3 am I shooting it wrong?"" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  ""I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!"" @PERSON6 forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1 were laughing and so was my cousin @PERSON4. @CAPS4 confesed that he was the one that shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decide that he was going to shoot @CAPS4 back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in @LOCATION4, my @CAPS5 @DATE4 asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin @PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told @PERSON2 that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that @TIME1 when my @CAPS5 was still home, @PERSON2 was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. @PERSON2 told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my @CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. @PERSON5 was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my @CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while @PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that @PERSON2 and I had fun outside.  I had such a great time while I was in @LOCATION4. Just being in @LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places to be.

20949,8,"                                  ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others @MONTH1 not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   @CAPS1 people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others @MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good.",16.0,20.0,,36.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20953,8," A while back, I had a friend named @PERSON4. We were best friends; like two peas in a pod. We would hang out everyday, all day @DATE1.  One random day we walked up to our other friend @PERSON1's house to see if she could hang out. We all were hanging out all day when @PERSON1 came up with an idea. She wanted both me and @PERSON2 to stay the @TIME1.We stayed out a little past dark and just walked around @CAPS1. We stopped at @LOCATION1's house so she could get her clothes then left to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. On our way there, we stopped, again, at @LOCATION2's house and chilled for a while. We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes just laughing @CAPS9 all the crazy stuff that has happened over @DATE1 already! When we were finally giving hugs to go to @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's older brother, smacked @PERSON1 on her butt and told her it was nice. We made fun of her for the longest time for that! Not to mention how @CAPS3 kept talking @CAPS9 that until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2.  When we left, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 and I were singing to @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when some random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I directed him to where he was going and he said, ""@CAPS6 you,"" and drove away. When he had gone, @PERSON4 looked at me and screamed, ""That was the hottest guy I have @CAPS7 seen!"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 the time we reached the @CAPS10 down the road we saw the guy again. @CAPS8 this time he wasn't so hot. He had a scruffy face and long, brown, straggly hair tied in a ponytail and was dressed like a hobo. I, still to this day, give her crap @CAPS9 it. That was the greatest @TIME1 of @DATE1.  We ended up going to the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to buy some drinks when @PERSON1 started freaking out @CAPS9 losing her @CAPS5. So we all had to retrace our steps all the way back to @LOCATION2's house, hoping we'd find it. Re-retracing our steps, we came across this guy who tried to help us find it. By then it was probably @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to head back to @ORGANIZATION1. Before We even stepped foot in her front door, her mom comes darting out and starts screaming at @LOCATION3. So her mom took me and @PERSON4 back to my house @CAPS8 by the time I knocked on the door, because it was locked, and everyone was asleep so we had no where to go. So for that @TIME1 @PERSON4 and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @TIME1. Almost fell asleep in the laundromat when i remembered that my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, no, i don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor of the laundromat so we crawled in.  It was a tight squeeze, @CAPS8 we managed. Plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee. It was, for sure, the worst thing 've @CAPS7 smelled. @CAPS8 no doubt was it the funnest @TIME1 I've had with that girl.",16.0,15.0,,31.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20955,8," Everyone laughs differently , some people laugh so hard that they cry, and some don't. But one thing that they have in common is laughter. People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy, or happiness, or even if something is just really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something for instance maybe you are having a bad day and then one of your friends comes up to you and tells you a funny joke. It makes you feel better, right? Having a good sense of humor is something that can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing things, or even like I said just a bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself and even something that you might have done that was embarrassing is a good thing, it can help you get over it and not be so embarrassed about it. Whenever I laugh I always feel better, laughing reminds me of all the good things in life. Laughing reminds me of good times I have spent with friends and family, it reminds me of all the inside jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years and that we can still laugh at just as hard as we used to. I believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you younger. When you laugh at things it creates long lasting memories that you will never forget and when you talk about them again in the future you will still think it is just as funny as before. Some of my best friends laugh at everything, they think that every little joke is the funniest ever, their laughs are unforgettable you can always hear them laughing. Which in another way shows how laughter can make anyone happy. If you believe that you are not a funny person, just say something to one of them and I can guarantee that they will laugh at it and you will feel funny and most likely start laughing as well.  I enjoy getting to spend quality time with some of my closest friends, and probably the best time I had with them was when we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for the beginning of @DATE1 before going into high school. It was two days after our promotion (graduation) from middle school. We packed up my family's car and headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. Not even half-an-hour into the car ride and we are already cracking up laughing at every little thing going on. We always create great memories and this one was already in the books for one of the best. I am sure that the car ride for my mom and aunt was just as fun, we sang songs and danced (as much as we could buckled down in a seat) to as many songs as we could fit in those two hours. Of course during the car ride we got stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a @CAPS1 fire drill around it. All the others cars watched and laughed at us even the construction workers though it was funny. We made a boring moment fun. Once we finally got there we did not hesitate to drop off our bags and grab our bikes and take off and explore. The weather was so nice, not a cloud in the sky. During our exploration bike ride we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about how excited we were to be out of middle school and moving on to high school. The next day we decided that we wanted to float down the river on a raft, sounds like a fun idea. Well it would be if we actually knew where we were going, I used to do it all the time with my family so I had an idea of where to go, but still five girls two rafts and a river, maybe not such a good idea. During the whole river raft trip we jumped back and forth between the two rafts occasionally splashing each other with the oars. Knowing us we laughed the whole way down the river. Whenever we passed people I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us by how much we were laughing and enjoying each others company. By the time we finished the rafting trip we were hungry good thing my mom had prepared us some lunch for when we got home, when we sat down at the table we could never keep a straight face. What made it even funnier was that my aunt and my mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and laugh. You know you have built a good friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh, already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the inside jokes you have with each other. All because of one little thing called laughter.

20956,8,"Laughter can be used for many things. One of which can be the important part of a relationship. There are many key parts in a relationship. But, the most important one is definitely the part of ""laughter being the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 laughter can cure the emotion of being sad. @CAPS1 it doesn't cure it.   If laughter is the shortest distance between two people then if a guy or girl meets someone they like. For instance, I have went up to a girl before and couldn't figure out anything to do or say. So, I just tried my best to make her laugh. It @MONTH1 have taken a few days of trying really hard to do so. But, in the the end, i was more comfortable asking her out and feeling more comfortable around her and her friends. @CAPS3 I can make her laugh I always feel better about myself because it is never a good thing to see her in a bad mood. Now on some occasions I have made people laugh and it not mean anything. But, @CAPS3 I make my girl laugh then it was totally worth it. Because I can cheer her up from being any kind of sad or angry to making her happy and full of laughter. It @CAPS1 helps with being depressed too. Her being depressed is kinda like a train wrecking off its tracks. It never turns out good. But @CAPS3 she is happy, she can be full of joy, all giddy, and @CAPS1 very spontaneous.  I know @CAPS1 being alone and laughing is good. But you can @CAPS1 get called crazy if you are laughing at nothing at all. The best way to know someone is possibly feeling better is laughter. If they laugh then they can't be mad, sad, or any kind of emotion besides happy, or maybe sarcasm. But sarcasm can be blown off like it is nothing. If I ever try sarcasm to make people laugh I always end up offending them. So I always just be myself around everyone I come around.  So if you ever hear that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. You should know that it is true. Because not only do you get to a lot more place and get to know someone more. But, you can also learn valuable things about life through being closer to more people. @CAPS3 you hear that phrase, ask yourself, ""@CAPS2 I capable of making someone laugh? @CAPS2 I able to pull off laughter and actually be close to someone?"" @CAPS3 you do that, you'll know that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.",18.0,18.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

20957,8," Each person filed in, one after the other, making a human train. The metallic red bell chimed once as each person pushed the door slightly more open. Walking in, I was enveloped by the smell of @CAPS1 food and conversations that hummed in my ears. I took a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where to go. To the right was a wall covered in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 symbols and meanings, while to the left were hundreds of tables already filled. Not knowing where to take my place, I turned to my mom. I so badly wanted to plop myself down at one of the adult tables, even if it meant I had to sit there silently. With moms knowing what's best, she shoved me towards the back of the restaurant, telling me to go sit with my cousins. I did as she told me, like always, but made my reluctance clear. Walking over to the table with the speed of a slug and my feet dragging on the floor, I awkwardly stood in front of the circular table. Yanking out one of the chairs, I turned to my mom with a pleading look as desperation filled every fiber of my body, for I knew there was no way she would give in. Staring at these six relatives, I didn't know how I could manage to sit here the rest of the evening.  We had all gathered at a @CAPS1 restaurant for my grandpa's @NUM1 birthday. Each of his children had flown from the mainland to @LOCATION1 in order to spend this special moment with him. I hadn't seen these cousins for over @NUM2 years, and some much longer. I had already visited with them since we'd been in @LOCATION1, but I hadn't talked to them much, none the less when we were all together and forced to mingle.  With my napkin on my lap, I sat and looked at my cousins, each one staring back at me like I was an animal at the zoo. After a moment or two, they seemed to forget I was there because they averted their gaze and began talking amongst themselves. The only person at the table who I didn't feel like a complete stranger towards was my cousin, @PERSON2. She had wavy brown hair with blindingly blond highlights, sun-kissed from those bright tropical days, along with that brown @CAPS6 skin that made me jealous. We began talking, and soon I found myself enjoying the moment.  It wasn't until the food came that we actually began interacting as a group. Being teenagers with bland palates, everyone stared as the waiter brought the first dish. After asking the friendly waitress what it was we were about to eat, from her broken @CAPS7 we deciphered that they were buns with duck inside. Frantically trying to get all of the tables served in fairly constant intervals, she left our table and all of us looked at our food blankly. No one wanted to take the first bite. One of my cousins, @PERSON1, stepped up to take the masculine role as the dare devil. We all waited tentatively as he chomped down on the moist bun and swallowed. Once done chewing, he smiled and it seemed this dish had won his approval. Digging into my buns, I began to wonder if maybe these people were easy to relate to and I had made a small thing into a big ordea. From then on, I would just be myself and stop worrying about not having seen anybody for years; All I needed was to be myself.  The way the courses were set up left plenty of time to chat between each plate they brought. Since I was no longer worrying about what to say or how to say it, I easily fit into the conversations and began to relax. Shortly after the duck tray was removed from the table, it was discovered that my cousin @PERSON1, who is from @LOCATION2, pronounces certain words with an accent. Soon everybody began comparing the way we pronounce things to the way that he does. After each difference we found, we would chuckle. Things carried on like that for the rest of the @TIME1, everyone laughing at things that were only moderately funny, but we found hilarious.  It was that @TIME1 when I realized, even though you @MONTH1 be uncomfortable around a group of people who you don't know very well, finding a common ground helps you to ease that discomfort. Finding something that you all enjoy talking about @MONTH1 be hard to do, but finding something that makes you laugh is a lot easier. Laughter is something that everyone enjoys and can take part in even if they're not contributing to the conversation. By feeling as though you're a part of what's going on, you feel accepted, and that's all anyone ever wants.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20958,8," People say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. A @ORGANIZATION1 I saw @CAPS6 to be true was when I met a girl named @PERSON1. Three years ago I was at a city @CAPS10 swinging, wondering if it would hurt if I jumped. I took @CAPS15 chances and let go of the swing chains, flying through the air , noticing the unbalanced feeling of falling in @CAPS15 chest, everything slowing down, the temptation of what will happen when I hit the ground was vast. Sticking the landing was a fail and getting up from it wasn't much of a success either, until I felt hands upon @CAPS15 shoulder and arm. I looked up at @CAPS15 helper and saw a girl. Not @CAPS5 a girl but a gorgeous girl.

Was all I could squeeze out.""@CAPS1, are you okay?"" @CAPS3 asked with a very concerned tone.""@CAPS4 I'm fine, @CAPS5 forgot to stick the landing. Thanks for helping me, um whats your name?"" I returned with a @NUM1, and your welcome. whats your name?"" @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 giggled before @CAPS3 said her name.""@CAPS7, do you want to walk around with me?"" I struggled to vocalize.""@CAPS8, but I have to @CAPS9 at the @CAPS10 because @CAPS15 mom will be here soon."" @PERSON1 stated. during the walk around the @CAPS10 we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking each other random question's that the other person had to answer. I figured out that @CAPS3 was @NUM2 years old, her favorite color was baby blue and @CAPS3 always wanted to be a doctor. we walked around the playground some more @CAPS5 talking about past memories or something that happened to each other in the past. I asked her if @CAPS3 had a brother and sister. her response was that @CAPS3 does have a brother, and two sisters. While I was listening to her I noticed @CAPS3 was very deep into thought and asked what @CAPS3 was thinking about and @CAPS3 quickly replied. ""@CAPS11, @CAPS5 wondering why I'm so happy with you.""""well it could be that I'm making you feel good by laughter. Or it could be @CAPS15 charms working on you."" I replied with a @CAPS12 accent.""@CAPS13 @CAPS4 its definitely that."" @CAPS3 barely got out the words cause of laughter.

20959,8," When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the @DATE3 beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the @DATE3, nor was it on a crazy @DATE4 break in @LOCATION2. My perfect day was on a @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 in @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story telling, and laughter. By @DATE1 I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However none were as hot as that weekend in late @DATE4. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first lay my eyes on @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that @DATE2 in @MONTH1 would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to it's comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS1 I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming.  After all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I also recall @PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When your on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in it's simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that @DATE2 I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 that @DATE1 I wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION1 and into the world of a few @CAPS1 rednecks. And as of a @DATE1 @TIME1, that has made all the difference.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,5,,,":** The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

20962,8," Moving around from place to place was always hard, I hated the thought of never seeing any friends or family. Never was the only word I could hold on to, there was no point in hope it was a futile feeling. I knew I would dearly miss @LOCATION1, and @ORGANIZATION1 just sounded so far; a twelve hour drive seemed like the edge of the earth to me. I visited @ORGANIZATION1 before, it was boring to tell the truth, and on top of that looking for a new house would bore me furthermore, all I could think about was @LOCATION1. Now I was moving there! When I first heard about the move I was infuriated and tried to fight against this poor decision, I was sure that my parents were making a mistake. As hard as I fought I could not win, my tears coulden't move my parents in the slightest way even In my greatest efforts, I was broken and confined to the moving van for twelve hours but to me it felt like forever. Finally my departure was over and my legs were sore and tired, I didn't want to manouver out of my seat or even touch @ORGANIZATION1's soil. The ground was dirty and tainted and the apartment complex was old and overly occupied, the rain and mud didn't help my attitude much either. Everything about this place was digusting and the thought of still sharing a room with my younger brother made me feel sick to my stomach. I stepped foot out side and entered my apartment and went straight to my bleakly colored room. I sat down and collected my thoughts trying to determine the pros and cons of my situation. The walls were caving in on me and they seemed to take the shape of bars, I was condemed to this fait that I could not escape untill I turned @NUM1, and that was more than @NUM2 years away! I was stuck in my apartment for three days before I wandered outside, but it wasn't all that horrible concidering it was raining all the time even at the end of the @DATE2 which was abnormal for me. I didn't want to leave my room or my apartment, all I wanted to do is watch @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons in my room. I felt alone and out of place I had no friends to talk to, my parents wouldent listen to me, and my little brother was only @NUM3 so he wouldent understand. There were no more smiles when I found out that I had to go to school the next day. Aloha park sounded like some school that would have great funding and spoiled rich kids in it but it was actually the exact opposite. It was an older school with kids that mostly lived in lower income housing at the time. In someways it was rather comforting knowing that I lived the same way temporarily. The first day of school was frightening, it was my first major transition into a new unfamilliar place. My teacher was old and grouchy, she seemed to have a major chip on her shoulder. Suddenly, out of the blue she held my hand in the hallway which was humilliating and definately not comforting. I heard my new classmates giggle and laugh when they saw me I thought I would never make any friends. The humiliation was withstandable but the thought of being in this class for the next nine months was a fear beyond belief. My teacher told me to take a seat on the far side of the room next to three boys, they all had the same expression which was an amalgamation of both alienated confusion and territorial pride. The feeling of being unwelcome would be an understament of the new nervous sensation that had surrounded me. I sat down unaware of the actions that the three boys might deal on to me, surprisingly the only occurence was a series of temporary stares and an aquard silence.  As the day continued life had again had become somewhat casual, until the boys had started to talk about the opposite gender and my attention was directly turned towards them. I sat there and quietly listened and smirked at the inapropriate conversation that I was clearly not supposed to be a part of. They laughed and snickerd and covered their mouths embarassingly, as I looked at them and concidered them amatures of the comical arts. I wanted to say something that I held onto for the whole conversation and then I took my chances to add a most important joke and quickly I muttered my overly inapropriate sentence. They confusingly looked at me and asked me what I had said, I wasnt sure how they would take the joke but I risked another chance and repeated it. The group of boys grew silent and the only noises were those of the other students talking to eachother, suddenly they bursted out laughing. I was overjoyed that they had a sense of humor, and after that I had friends and @CAPS1.

20963,8,"                 Laughter at its @CAPS1  Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the @CAPS1 they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I @MONTH1 actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just to unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @PERSON1 and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":**

20964,8," It was @DATE1 seventh and I had invited my two best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, to go to my boyfriend's football game with me. It would be the first time for them to meet him since he went to a different high school than we did. Our plan was to get off the bus at my house and then my @CAPS3 would take us to his game later. When we arrived at the end of the lane we started walking up to my house. Then all of the sudden ""ahhhhhh, @CAPS1 my god!"" @PERSON2 and I were both screaming at the top of our lungs, ""@CAPS2 a... ahhhh!"". @PERSON2 and I had almost stepped on a dead snake that was laying in the lane. While this was going on @PERSON1 had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming. We looked back at her and saw a completely puzzled look on her face which we found absolutely hilarious so we burst out laughing. She soon figured out that we had been startled by the snake and also started in ""you guys are so funny @CAPS2 just a dead snake"". We talked and laughed our way up to my house. @CAPS4 we had caught up a little and I had changed into my boyfriends #@NUM1 jersey, we went downstairs to eat. We sat down at the table with our bowls of chili and started eating. My @CAPS3 came over and put her bowl down then went back into the kitchen to get something. When she came back she had napkins and another bowl, I playfully ask her ""are you really hungry @CAPS3?"" she said ""no..uh why?"" That's when the girls and I started laughing hysterically again, ""@CAPS3 you have two bowls you are obviously very hungry"" I giggled. She turned a little red and then said back ""well I do love chili, I can't ever seem to get enough of it"" then she laughed a little ""your probably right I should just start with one bowl.""  @CAPS4 we gathered the blankets for the stands we left. On our way up we made a pit stop at the famous @ORGANIZATION1. I was so exited to see my boyfriend and to have my friends come along that coffee was probably not the best idea, but we stopped anyway. While we were in there waiting for our coffee we passed the time by making faces through the nearby window at people who happened to drive by. We were cracking up over the looks people gave us, some looked like @CAPS5 thought it was funny while others looked like @CAPS5 thought we had escaped from a nut house. Soon enough our drinks were ready and we headed out the door. Then as we were walking to the car some guy whistled at us. We hopped in the car and then lost it when we saw that it was some guy who was dressed up in one of those statue of liberty costumes.  We were almost at the school and I was bouncy from the caffeine and excitement mix. My @CAPS3 had never driven to @PERSON3's school before, while my dad had only was busy that night. I was trying to keep calm while giving her directions in a very giggly manner. I started off by saying ""you go straight up here @CAPS3"" the my @CAPS3 and the girls said ""honey you can't go straight up here"". ""yes you can"" I argued then @CAPS4 a while @PERSON1 said ""girl look you could go straight but you ain't gonna see @PERSON3 if you do"". I realized @CAPS5 were right and told my @CAPS3 ""don't turn, just turn right"" she got confused cause I had said the directions wrong so she turned left. I started to freak, screaming ""no no no! we have to turn around I meant right"" @CAPS5 all burst out laughing at me ""man calm down woman, we just have to turn around"" said @PERSON2. We finally got back on track and I tried to give clear directions. I wasn't completely positive where the turn off was for his school so I told my @CAPS3 to go slow, when we passed it and I freaked out again. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS3 we have to turn around"" @CAPS5 all laughed at this and then my @CAPS3 said that she was testing me to see if I could be patient. We all laughed again. When we got there and hopped out to pay and get in. We got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room. I got another dose of excitement, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 started to walk away so I could wave at @PERSON3. I pulled on their shirts and begged them to stay because I didn't want to be the only person waiting. Then I saw him run past and before I knew it I leaped off the ground and waved frantically. I saw him smiling as he ran onto the field, my friends laughed at how I jumped and we enjoyed the game.",16.0,20.0,,36.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20966,8,"                              The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is one of the most important things in life. When im with my family, we all have such a great time together that we laugh all the time at things or memories we say we remember. While we are all gathered around the table whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner we always have something fun to say and laugh about all the time. To begin with, during breakfast @DATE2 @TIME1, we were all having a great time eating first thing in the @TIME1, but suddenly when my sister remembers about what had happened the day before at her job, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so we can also laugh with her about it. She had said that there was a banana lying on the floor, when her manager went by she didn't see it and slipped right through the hall. It was impossible not to laugh about it becuase it was the manager. Well that @TIME1 was going by so fast just by thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Every time I would remember I would start laughing so much that I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that same day. I answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling. Suddenly she said ""@CAPS3 you will not believe what just happend, your dog just got finished taking a shower and is running around like crazy on top of the beds and coutches trying to get dried off"" I couldn't believe it and I starting laughing so hard that I had to tell my freinds that were next to me and them too starting laughing as well. I could picture in my head how funny that would be if I was there watching her run around like a crazy dog. As the day went by, all I would do is remember how funny that is for a dog to do that, that I would just start laughing all of a sudden during class at school, but even though it was something good to laugh at I had to stop laughing because everyone was just staring. Finally, when it was time for dinner, at the table that night we all told eachother about our day. Everyone had something new to say but, when my brother started to tell us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because it was so funny what he wanted to say that he was just laughing. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he came out he noticed that all his freinds were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he came out of the bathroom he had a big piece of tiolet paper stuck to his pants. I immediatley thought he would have gotten embarrased but instead he said he thought it was funny as well. My parents, my sister and I started to laugh so hard that we had even forgotten about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying their cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughter each day, it just wouldnt be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to have your day go by and wait for the next. We all at the end said that our day went by so fast, that it was or couldn't be true that the day was over and it was time for bed. The day of @DATE1 third was one of many days that was the best and that we all enojoyed and had fun laughing with eachother telling about funny things that happen to us during our day.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

20968,8,"                          Laughing is the key of happiness. Is a moment that is remember by many people. You share many laughs with friends, family and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone it shows that you have something in common; you both think something is funny and it could build a strong relationship. For me laughing means a lot, i laugh everyday. I will not forget the time when i was really mad at my dad and then laughter fixed the problem. One night me and my dad were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I could still fix them that there was a solution. He was calling me a liar, and more anger kept on building up. He was so hard headed and I couldn't get through his thoughts. He was saying that i could not fixed what i have done: whats done is done. I was getting really mad, I wanted him to go away and i thought i was not ever going to talk to him. We had a lack of trust and i just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I knew he would have got more mad and we were gonna end up screaming at each other. It got me so mad that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best from me, and he was disappointed. I got really sad because my dad was the kind of guy that was all ways telling jokes and teasing everyone. He always made my day by making me laugh. Usually when he would get me in trouble, it would end up with a joke at the end. The jokes he made when i was sad or mad would build our relationship stronger; we would always end up laughing. Later the night we were with all my family cutting my niece's cake and me and my dad were not talking. As we were singing happy birthday i would glare at him and look down. He was looking at me as if he was all tough. Then we were all saying ""-í@CAPS1 le sople!"", which means blow out the candles in @CAPS2. All of the sudden my uncle blows out the candle on accident and me and my dad stared at each other and laughed so hard. We were crying of laughter and we couldn't stop laughing. It felt great laughing at the same thing and sharing a moment together and putting aside our anger. My dad would try not to laugh but the more he tried the louder his laugh was. It was only me and him who stayed laughing, everyone else giggled. As it was making my dad and my relationship better it build a connection between my family and I. Its a memory that's gonna last a life time, yet it was an important part of my dad and my relationship. Although he was still upset about my grades it was all better. There was a connection between us and we could still look back and laugh about it. I don't know what it was about the night that i found the incident so funny. As it was making my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter it was all build up on the memory. Something me and him both share, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem wasn't fixed but it was as if it was not important, as if laughing made you change and helped us put it aside. Every laughing moment we have now is something me and him share, its now a connection. We both can laugh about the same things and share our thoughts making us stronger. Telling me that while me and him laugh about things is just putting more the negatives away and giving life more meaning. When you know you're happy is when you have a sense of humor. Also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment when you made laughing an important part of your pass. When all those funny moments become important because that's when you showed you were happy. Its even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will be all remembered as a happy moment. I know at times i will have moments where i am not laughing, but the key is to always look at the bright side. Even though me and my dad were mad at each other its a memory that will carry on with me forever.",18.0,18.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20971,8," @CAPS8 families @DATE1 in @LOCATION1 was one of exploration, but also one in which we came to regret our move from @LOCATION3 a little. We missed our friends, our connections, but also places. The place @CAPS8 brother and I came to miss second only to our farm was a @CAPS3 we had dubbed ""The @CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS3."" The place itself was a dump. Close to a dairy farm, it reeked of cow pats mixed with cigarettes. I remember that the grass was perpetually dry, and the bridge crossing the @CAPS3 was continually squeaking; it was an old, covered bridge, and on its last leg. So, it wasn't so much the place we missed, but the happy memories associated with our special place. On one particularly mopey day, our father roused us from our rooms, saying that we were going to explore a new @CAPS3. We knew about @CAPS4's adventures; we called them ""@CAPS4-ventures"" because they were truly one of a kind. Most of the time, we ended up miles away from any civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach. Even at our young ages, we had come to be wary of ""@CAPS4-ventures."" @CAPS7, our mother was able to rouse @CAPS8 brother and I, and we were soon hustled into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably cheerful. While @CAPS8 brother and I were in the back of the car, pining for our nice, comfortable rooms, @CAPS8 father had the audacity to laugh along to the radio, and open the windows of the car to our protests. Riding with @CAPS8 brother and I in the back were two circular lumps of rubber that had been inflated. I would soon learn that these were called inner tubes, and could be used to drift down the @CAPS3. After what seemed like hours on the road, we arrived at a place called ""@LOCATION2 bend."" @CAPS8 brother and I jumped out of the car, and were met with pristine beauty. Covered in shade, the @CAPS3 flowed noisily, and we could hear it although we were not that close to the @CAPS3 bank. The grass was green and velvety beneath our feet, and the smell of fresh water welling up from the earth was delicious. The light filtered down through the trees and had a crystalline effect on the water. @CAPS8 brother and I hurriedly dressed into our swimsuits, while @CAPS8 father began to cart our food and supplies down the the @CAPS3 bank where we would be spending the day. As soon as we finished dressing, @CAPS8 brother and I chased after him, for the day was warm and the water looked good and cool. When our hunger had been sated, it was time to pull out the inner tubes. The water was nice and fast, with some white water and a very little water fall at the end. Being a rather petite child for @CAPS8 age, even these small obstacles looked like the most insidious of rapids, and they made @CAPS8 eyes widen a little. @CAPS7, I managed to steady myself, and prepared to get wet. At @DATE1, I hung on to @CAPS8 inner tube with clutched fingers and wild eyes, but gradually, I relaxed. I let @CAPS8 hand drift out to causally trail behind me in the water, drawing circles as the sunlight filtered down through the trees. As the water grew faster, I began to feel apprehensive again. I drew sharp, quick breaths as the little waterfall approached me. In reality, it was only about four feet tall, but in @CAPS8 panicked haze, those four feet looked like twelve feet. The white water was suddenly upon me, accompanied by a large and frightful shriek I gave. Somehow, I managed to stay afloat, and @CAPS8 ride left me smiling. I broke into long peals of laughter, laughing away all @CAPS8 homesickness and heartsickness. @CAPS8 brother came down the waterfall, spluttering and giggling, and we laughed together. Our laughter healed us, and for the @DATE1 time since the move, we felt totally and completely at home.",21.0,25.0,,46.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,5,,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of. Every time we were together there was no thought in my mind that we were not happy together, no worry that you would ever leave. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child i had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time, @CAPS4 when i thought of you i got this glow. Everybody saw it. they would ask, ""@CAPS2 have you been doing? Your so happy, I've never seen you like this before."" That, @CAPS2 they saw in me was the power of love. @CAPS4 something they did not see was @CAPS2 we had together. When it was just me @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 one of us would do something @CAPS3 neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt from @CAPS1 so hard. that is @CAPS2 I love, I grew to love every part of you. Especially your laugh.  From @CAPS2 i hear, they say the laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I would have to agree. Being able to laugh with someone, @CAPS3 being able to be yourself @CAPS3 not have to hold up this front, its magical. Its something that makes a relationship last. I guess its kinda like glue in sense. My brother @CAPS3 i are the closest you can get to best friends, @CAPS3 guess @CAPS2 we do in our spare time? We laugh.

20973,8,"    Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether the person is a relative, friend, or someone you are dating. Laughter makes you forget your worries and problems. But with a friendship based on laughter, when do you trade in the giggles for seriousness? I believe laughter is vital in a friendship. But to have a strong, healthy, relationship you also need a level of seriousness. This is the story of how I learned to balance laughter and seriousness in one of my most important relationships.    Olivia has been my best friend as long as I could remember, hanging out we laughed constantly. Laughter has always been a huge part of our friendship and always will be. But going into middle school we faced drama, boys and arguments, which we never experienced with one another. All of these small but important things to us then added up and began to make us drift apart. Our lack of sharing our feelings and instead cover it up with laughs caused us to bottle up anger towards each other. I always thought we were perfect matches for best friends because our countless inside jokes and the constant fun we would have. But our anger grew until we were ready to handle it, which we did not understand then.   We started to hang out less and less, and our daily calls became weekly. Both of us noticed a change in our friendship, but didn't know how to fix it, we apologized for fighting with each other and sympathized for our boy troubles but it wasn't the same. I missed her but the longer it went on the easier it was to not talk or hang out. Summer came around and our moms planned me to stay a week at her house while my parents were on vacation. To put it nicely I was less than thrilled, how was I suppose to stay a week there when we barely talk anymore? I knew everything would be okay but I still worried that the week would be constant fighting instead of laughs.    Finally the day came and my parents were driving me to her house. As I got there things were fine, we pretended nothing was going on and had fun, it was that way for a few days. But on the third day she broke the ice, asking what was wrong and why we don't talk anymore. That day something amazing happened, we talked about all our feelings and what was upsetting us. It was a little awkward at first but we got through it together. The fights got less and less because we knew the things that bugged each other, and everything slowly became better than it was before. That talk changed our relationship forever and I'm so glad she had spoken up when I didn't or else we wouldn't be as close as we are today.    That day was @DATE1, but had a huge impact on our friendship.Ever since we got that mile stone in our friendship I knew better how to be more open with other people also. Olivia has taught me so much but this was among the more important lesson. Laughter is a huge part of any strong relationship but you also need to be able to share your feelings and be serious. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with and I am grateful to have mine stick with me no matter what.",21.0,20.0,,41.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20974,8," Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry in a couple, and it shows happiness within family and friends. How depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4"". The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you, you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good element to have when you are meeting someone new, and spending time with your family. Last @DATE1, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a @ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small @CAPS5 town. We picked up the children from their houses and drove them to the @ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight serious faces in our big twelve passenger white vans, it would send out a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about @CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle. A lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a change in the children lives. Our @ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ORGANIZATION1, the town's appearance is flat like a desert, there's no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. @CAPS8 gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @DATE1 to remember. @CAPS8 opened the hearts of the @CAPS5 children so that they @MONTH1 hear the word of @CAPS8. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture perfect family everyday, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course a family does not have to be related, it could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick-flick movie. My cousin, @PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental check-outs waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, ""I can go down the biggest hill"" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, @PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But @PERSON1 was mesmerized with this gorgeous girl and all he could say was, ""@CAPS9"". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is ""@PERSON2"". Apparently, @PERSON2's friends spotted @PERSON1 first and told @PERSON2 the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged @PERSON2 to ask him out and get to know him. @PERSON2, being the daring one, agreed. @PERSON1's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know @CAPS2 @MONTH1 hear you and how that person could effect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirit, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects @CAPS2 you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter"" would we?",22.0,22.0,,44.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The writing is clear and focused.

20975,8," Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @PERSON1 did not really like each other but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night we were closer then brothers and there is one huge funny tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched @LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin @PERSON1 turns to me and says ""you want to do something really fun."" @CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the wall of blackberry bushes that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes we ended up on a gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats, I had no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON1 walked right up to these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them just fell over stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing then the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night, started off when @PERSON1 informed me that he brought an @NUM1 firework. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off and the bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity the goats all collapsed and we were doubled up with laughter, that is until the people in the house came out side. We ran like our life's depended on it, we flew down the road through the blackberry path, trough the field and straight into @PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs were aching from it, I was light headed with laughter. His parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent giggles. That was one of the funnest times I've had with my cousin and even tough we did not like each other before hand, we ended up becoming brothers in all but blood, but we were cousins so maybe even a little bit by blood but mostly brothers in laughter.",20.0,16.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20976,8," Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It does not need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the one form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has @CAPS9 boundary.  @CAPS5 was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS5 would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 asked @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wanted to be, @CAPS5 would say invisible. People passed @CAPS8 by without even a glance, thinking @CAPS4 I don't see @CAPS8 than @CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS5 needed a friend. Someone that @CAPS5 could talk to, or atleast get a smile from. However, how would I approach @CAPS8? Would @CAPS5 think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS8 to talk, or atleast smile. As I walked into school the @DATE1, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper air-planes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your @DATE1 period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair @DATE1 to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone sit right @DATE1 to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Futhermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had drawn that picture. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said in very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. ""@CAPS2,"" I began, ""I believe @CAPS10 are a very good artist. Do @CAPS10 have any other pictures?"" ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said again, ""however, they are all at home."" ""Is there any possible way that I @MONTH1 be able to see these other pictures of your's?"" I said happily. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS10 would like, @CAPS10 are more than welcome to come over to my house after to school today and see them."" @CAPS5 said in a very joyful voice. ""I would be honored,"" I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began @CAPS8 lesson. @CAPS5 was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the @DATE1. When the school @DATE1 came to a close, we meant each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as @CAPS2, because I knew that @CAPS5 was fnally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS8 house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS8 mother yelled from the other room, ""is that @CAPS10 sweetie?"" ""@CAPS1 mother,"" @CAPS5 said back, ""I have a friend over."" ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 mother exlaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mother and then we went up to @CAPS8 room. @CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS5 had done. @CAPS5 told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired @CAPS8 to draw it. @CAPS5 asked @CAPS4 I have ever drawn a picture before. ""@CAPS9,"" I said, ""I am what @CAPS10 call challenged in the world of art."" We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS8 picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then began to laugh hysterically. ""@CAPS10're clouds look like potatoes,"" @CAPS5 said. Then we laughed even harder and we continued to laugh for what seemed like an hour. Finally, when i left the house and went home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone that needs a friend. I also realized that it can be the most simple thing that can make @CAPS10 laugh; like a bad drawing. This is beacuse laughter is contagious and we all know that we all love to laugh.",20.0,22.0,,42.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20977,8," ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" @CAPS3 quote can be agreed by everyone on @LOCATION1. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time. Especially @CAPS1 with a person you care about. @CAPS1 is something you and another person can do together with ease. @CAPS3 brings two people closer together and brightens a person's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for a guy who knows how to make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguing isn't going to be the main part of @CAPS3 relationship. Having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life. At the age of sixteen I had my first boyfriend. I was the girl who kept on rejecting guys and telling them I was trying to wait for that perfect guy. In the @DATE2 I met @ORGANIZATION2. Even though he was older than me and we might be opposites, he always knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him and talking on the phone a couple of times I realized that I started to have feelings for @CAPS3 boy. Whenever we talked he always had me @CAPS1. I found @CAPS3 very attractive. Having someone who brings some sunshine into my life made me feel like I was on top of the world. On @DATE1 there was a football game, @ORGANIZATION1 (two schools who are rivals). During @CAPS3 time him and I still weren't dating. That day I invited him to come over so we could watch the game together. I had previously told him how I love stuffed animals. That day he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. We were walking around the track, @CAPS2 all of a sudden I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laugh. He had his arm around me and whispered in my ear ""I would never let you @DATE3."" I turned cherry red. From that day on he will remember me as the clumpsy girl who trips all the time. Now that i look back at the day I realize how funny that memory was. Looking back at embarrassing moments is always a good thing in a relationship.  @CAPS2 you are looking for someone who you want to spend the rest of your life together you have to make sure you like them for whom they are. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone who you can have a good time with and crack some jokes around. I always tell my friends ""@CAPS1 is a great ab workout."" Which is true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends, and laugh about random stuff is always something I look forward to. If there is no @CAPS1 going on, then that means I'm not having a good time. But lucky me, I have amazing friends who make jokes about everything. Whenever I'm around them there is never a moment @CAPS2 I'm not @CAPS1. Being able to make others laugh is a great characteristic in a person.  @CAPS2 you meet a new person, would you rather have awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? I'm hoping we have the same answer, because I hate awkward silence. I need to know that @CAPS3 person will make me laugh and smile and not make me be thinking ""@CAPS2 will I be able to leave?"" @CAPS3 is one of the worst situations anyone would want to go through, I can say @CAPS3 from personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at saying jokes, I use all my embarrassing moments and thats my way I have people @CAPS1. I don't get mad about it, I'm the total opposite. I laugh along with them. I know I'm clumpsy, I know I have my moments, and if these things can bring a smile to a persons face, then I'm @PERCENT1 fine with it. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS2 they are down. So instead of cracking a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that has happened to me. Everyone is unique in their own ways. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making others laugh. And once a guy gets a girl to laugh, that's the first sign @CAPS3 guy was meant for them. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS1 means that you are having a good time. @CAPS1 brings people together. @CAPS1 can brighten a persons life. So next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help you break the ice.",20.0,22.0,,42.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20981,8," My cousin @PERSON1 and I are constantly sick with laughter, he is the funniest person I know. He is hilarious when he isn't trying to be. I believe that is why he is so @NUM1king funny. @PERSON1 is a hardcore alcoholic, he is always drunk or drinking. On the rare occasion that he is doing neither of those two options, he is the dullest, most depressed, angry unfunny man around. Give him a drink or two and watch him turn into funtime @CAPS1. @PERSON1 and I have great grand wonderous times when there is an alcoholic beverage in or near his hands. @CAPS5 is sort of an awe inspiring thing to see this transformation take place. He starts as this sad, depressed, sober caged sociopath lion at the zoo with so many of society's judgemental, sour souled, pittiful excuses for men and women pointing, laughing and sobbing over this poor lion. When one of these ""people"" throw a beer his way he'll catch @CAPS5 in his fierce, angry teeth and devour a @NUM2 oz tallboy of @CAPS2 in mere seconds-- can and all! He then stands up on his gigantic feline paws and let out an amazingly deep vibrato of a purr. His big, ferocious cat teeth then smile like a @LOCATION1 lion, as his sick, beastly, blood stained fur slowly morphs into the scaley, scarred skin of a man. As he is standing there with a goofy idiotic sh!t eating grin he shouts ""I @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @PERSON1!!"" @CAPS5 really is an amazing thing, I have seen @CAPS5 so many times and I absolutely @CAPS6 find a single word to desribe this marvelous reconstruction of a living creature. Then with drinks in hand we will continue to have a great night of unknown comical amusements.

20982,8," One day my friends and I went to a friends house and we started playing @CAPS1 box we were laughing having an awesome time. My friend @CAPS2 started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk at that time and @CAPS5 laughed so hard that milk started coming out of his nose, that was also funny but gross at the same time. @CAPS6 was the sad one of the whole group that was there, we all asked him, @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 so sad @CAPS5 answered that @CAPS5 heard that his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So @CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested, and we said that @CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS5 said that @CAPS5 would think about it @CAPS6 was a real funny person and a blast to hang out with, so we didn't really worry about it so much, we thought that everything would be fine. So after all that @CAPS5 left and we started hanging out in my friend, @CAPS7's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the hottest girl at school. So an hour past and my friend @CAPS6 came back. @CAPS5 came and sat with us and yelled I didn't work man, I was like okay calm down, @CAPS9 happened I asked?. @CAPS5 said, she didn't think it was funny she thought that I was being dumb and just plain silly. Oh did she really say silly that's not I word i thought she knew, everyone laughed, no @CAPS6 I was just messing with you man don't get mad come on now. So @CAPS6 left after @CAPS5 yelled at me, @CAPS5 left and all of us guys started laughing I thought that @CAPS5 was just but hurt and @CAPS5 would get over it. an hour past and my phone starts ringing and I look who's calling and it @CAPS6 s ex girlfriend. Surprised I answer and I tell her that @CAPS6 wasn't with us that I would tell him to call you later, I said that because @CAPS5 would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that she wanted to talk to me so I was like okay so we started talking and she is telling me that she likes me... I start cracking up in laughter. She got all sad and mad at me because of me laughing. But I told that it was cool that she did so I told her I have to go and we hanged up...

20983,8," Laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way. The implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends. It is my opinion that healthy relationships whether they be a friendship or even greater, hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it. I personally use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental element of my relationship with my father's side of the family. One specific example of how I utilize the essential tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members whom i have not seen in a long period of time. Laughter is a tremendous element of my relationship with my father's entire family, and small family meetings as well as full family reunions do not exist without it. Being that they are scattered across @LOCATION2, and very few live in the vicinity of @LOCATION1, visiting with these family members is a rare occasion. The most admirable quality of my father's side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares. Laughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well. Relationships that I share with individual family members can be observed in every family assembly as well. Just @DATE1 my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in @DATE2. This event holds a specific example where laughter was a predominant element of a relationship between myself and one of my family members. Not only was I to be the only guy there, but I was also to be placed at a table with my aunt whom I had not seen for over a year. Although we had always enjoyed eachother's company in the past, I dreaded an awkward reunion and sitting in complete silence for the entirety of the festivities. The day of my sister's baby shower inevitably arrived and to my surprise, I was nervous. I assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat. Within ten minutes of doing so, my aunt and table partner entered and located her seat which was adjacent to mine. However nervous I had been, the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how I was the only guy attending the shower. For the duration of the party, all I heard was jokes coming from my aunt and the laughter shared between the two of us. We reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all. Through the use of laughter my aunt and I reconnected with one another and possibly had the most fun out of anyone who attended. Whether we were making jokes about some of the party gifts, or simply enjoying one of the ridiculous games, my aunt and myself were laughing hysterically. on this specific day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but was the sole reason for my friendly relationship with my aunt.",20.0,23.0,,43.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

20984,8,"                     LaughterLaughter can change a lot in people,it can bring people together. It can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing. @CAPS2 your with your friends laughter can and will always be there, well i know it is with my friends and I. @CAPS2 your in a relationship or a friendship, @CAPS1 able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them,@CAPS2 you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that's even better because then you know your getting somewhere.  My best friend and I laugh all the time, @CAPS3 can just look at me in a way I only understand and I'll know what @CAPS3 means, and then we both start laughing @CAPS2 we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what were laughing about, most of the time they don't get it. My best friend and I are always together,besides school, we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago. My best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes,we only have to bring one time of hanging out and if something funny happened we will start laughing about it again. In a relationship as in having a ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. My boyfriend does it to me, no matter if I'm not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face, most of the time it works. @CAPS2 you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy. That means girls don't get over the stupid little things. Boys don't get mad @CAPS2 they want to hang out with there friends.  The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another, and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. My relationship works out amazing, because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend, so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight it's nice to have all of us friends, that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day were not totally sure though.  I think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. Just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won't have any friends, cause they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way. Normally the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did that once and @CAPS3 was not happy as all in the relationship,@CAPS3 told me they never laughed together or anything,@CAPS3 was afraid to break up with him though cause @CAPS3 would not have any friends,cause @CAPS3 made him her life.  Laughter can always make you feel better, it'd kinda like a healing process it will always be there, its just a matter if someone can make you laugh. Theirs people that can make you laugh and @CAPS4 and videos and family. @CAPS2 your with someone that makes you happy it is like you full of joy and enjoyment to be around them and you care for them and you feel comfortable around them. If you have struggles and get through them and they still make you laugh and happy you will know that they are the one your happy and can laugh around. Family always makes you laugh weather you don't want to or not, i love my dad he always knows how to make me laugh. ",16.0,15.0,,31.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

20985,8," The @CAPS1 @CAPS2     I was sitting in the living room with @CAPS3 family talking about how every @ORGANIZATION1 we always end up laughing. One @ORGANIZATION1 we were out at @CAPS3 great grandpas house, and we just got done opening our presents, and in the middle of the floor was a @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 cousin @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was inside the @CAPS2.   At first we tried to convince @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was out side talking to @CAPS3 uncle. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't believe us, even though @CAPS3 dad was outside talking. @ORGANIZATION2 circled the @CAPS2, and observed the @CAPS2 and was convinced @CAPS3 dad was in it.  Then @ORGANIZATION2 started poking the @CAPS2. We were laughing because it was so cute that @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was in the @CAPS2. He kept saying ""I know he is in there."" @ORGANIZATION2 opened the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad was not in there. @CAPS3 dad walked in to the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story and he started laughing too. Later on in the @TIME1 @ORGANIZATION2 was playing in the other room and wanted to show @CAPS3 dad the toy he was playing with. So @CAPS3 dad climbed in the @CAPS2 and we told @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was outside. @ORGANIZATION2 went outside to look for him but @CAPS3 dad wasn't there.   When @ORGANIZATION2 came inside he looked in every room and could not find @CAPS3 dad. After a while @ORGANIZATION2 was standing by the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad jumped out and scared @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 screamed like a little girl and we all laughed really hard.   @ORGANIZATION2 was mad at first then he started laughing too. At the time @ORGANIZATION2 was only five so when @CAPS3 dad jumped out at him he got really scared. @ORGANIZATION2 thought it would be funny to scare @CAPS3 dad so @ORGANIZATION2 hid in the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad came inside and we told @CAPS3 dad to look for @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3 dad called his name looked in every room and pretended like he couldn't find @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing because @CAPS3 dad acted like he was going to sit on @ORGANIZATION2 and it made him laugh super hard. When @ORGANIZATION2 got out of the @CAPS2 he was like ""how did you know I was in the @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 dad said ""well you started laughing silly goose.""   out of all the @ORGANIZATION1's i have had that @ORGANIZATION1 was the best @ORGANIZATION1 ever. That was the time laughter brought two people together.

20987,8,"  While you being to make any kinda of relationship with anyone, you are usually going to start off making jokes and being silly. Whether your trying to be flirty with them, or just be the funny one and make a good, first impression. Usually all of these things lead to someone laughing; even if they really didn't have a reason to. Anyone who is shy around new people, will most likely laugh about anything they say. If it's someone you already knew, you could always be giggling about something. There are different types of relationships you build with different people and laughter is almost always the number one way to keep it together.   When you have been in a strong friendship with someone, you are already very close with each other. The laughing, crying, and fighting you do with that person, will make the relationship stronger. There are times that you spend with another individual that will makes steps towards sticking together. From my experiences, i will become somebodies close friend for quite sometime; then we will get into an argument and no longer be friends. Although we fought and wished to not talk, we became good friends again because of all the time we had spent laughing together. Being sad all the time, with no one else to laugh with, made us realize how much we missed each other. Even though meeting someone new was simple; it didn't last as long as the friendship i had with the other person.  Truly, when you meet someone for the first time, whether it's a boy or a girl, you will laugh and make jokes almost the whole time. That might even be how it will stay. Once you have known a person for so long, you can tell what type of relationship you will have with them. The connection you make with them is simple;you could get along, or you could always argue. No matter what relationship you make with an acquaintance, will most likely be the same all the time. When you are not as close with another person, you tend to not care about the friendship as often. You wont be as emotional, although your experiences you have with them could always lead to laughing. The time you spend with anyone should always be full of fun and laughter.      Another form of laughter could be spent with a boyfriend or girlfriend. in my opinion, you will make a special connection with your other half. When two people have chosen to be together, they're choosing to spend their time getting to know each other on a different level. The fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love the you would have with a best friend. Couples should be enjoying their time together laughing, and making each other happy. Making each other laugh will allow them to be closer in friendship; becoming comfortable with one another. they will gain more confidence and ability, just by sharing the times laughing together.   The laughter you laugh with anyone, will build any type of relationship. Usually the first impression will identify the connection you have with that individual. There are always ways that you will act with one person and not the other. The three different types of friendship that are most common are; acquaintances, boy friend/girl friend, and close friends. All of the friends you make, people you meet, will involve a lot of laughter.",20.0,15.0,,35.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,3,,":**

20988,8,"  What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""@CAPS2 me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""@CAPS3"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""@CAPS5 two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was @CAPS9 @CAPS10 as was @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about @NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS8 was a quiet, @CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about @NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS5 barely know someone @CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around @CAPS5. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless!

20992,8," So many people sing songs and write stories about sad depressing events, like it's the only thing life consists of. We seem to never stop and focus on the little things. If we could stop and appreciate those little things, everyone would realize just how much they really have. In some way or another we all seek pity and for some reason we want to have the worse story. Like it's some sort of competition. I personally don't want to have the worse story. If you just ""go with it"" things seem more lighthearted, care free, and people would rather be around someone that makes them feel good and happy than someone that makes them feel sad. There is many times where I could have chosen to stay mad and upset, but instead I chose to just laugh, and not make a big deal out of a small mistake. For example, @DATE1 was the @CAPS1 dance. I was supposed to be there early to finish decorating, but I was late (like always). It didn't really matter that I was late because when I got there I found out that it was canceled. By the time they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage) my parents already drove away and they didn't have their cell phones with them. I was stuck at the school. While I was trying to get hold of somebody to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them that the dance was canceled. My friend's mom was nice enough to come pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown, where we decided to go to @LOCATION1's and play arcade games. We had an amazing time! We all got matching rings and I got two lollipops. When we were done we went up to our friends house, where we watched movies and ate popcorn. I had eaten way to much sugar and was super hyper! I kept saying a ton of random things, but it made for a great evening full of laughing. I could have been really upset that the dance was canceled, all of us could have, but we made the most out of what we had and ended up having a really good time. And I personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been. Another example is when I was a freshman. There was one day that seem particularly hard. I felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting in the hall by myself, feeling like nobody cared. A senior that year came up to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me that it's harder frown than it is to smile. I realized that he was absolutely right. Even though smiling takes more muscles, frowning in the long run has a worse effect. If I could go back to that day I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't even true. I always say things that I latter regret, but if I just ""go with it"" it doesn't seem near as bad. If I could, I would write a dozen songs that have no sad or depressing meaning. Or a millions books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall down, it's better to laugh than to run away crying. What won't kill you will make you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger, like: breakups, heartaches, @CAPS2.E class, and of course laughing. Laughing also makes you live longer; so why wouldn't you laugh as much as you possible could?",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":**

20993,8," Many have heard that laughing makes you live longer. I don't know if this is true but I can believe it. When I laugh I feel lighter, my stress load lightens, @PERSON1 I am able to see the world with different eyes. This change in myself is more evident sometimes than others, such as if before the miracle of laughter I was feeling overworked, worn out, or sad. It is my belief that having people to make you laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, @PERSON1 I am grateful that my days are filled with great friends @PERSON1 funny memories.  One of the things that must be present in any relationship is humor; you must be able to make each other laugh. I have had multiple times with my two best friends, @PERSON1, when we simply couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave feeling happy, with a smile on my face, with many good stories to tell. One of these occasions was @PERSON1's birthday party the @DATE1 before last.  @PERSON1 wanted a small party with just the people closest to her there, so @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I were the only ones invited. We live a tiny, cute town, however, there isn't much to do in the area of parties. Because of this, everyone ends up going to @CAPS1, just half an hour away. It was a blistering @DATE1 day @PERSON1 we wanted to show off our tans, so of course @PERSON1 started her party off with a float on the meandering @CAPS2 river. That's when the laughing began. Three twelve year old girls drifting down a river by themselves with a giant beach ball (early birthday present) that was promptly dubbed @CAPS3, what could be so funny? One of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is how we find humor in every situation when we are together. They thought it was hilarious that I have an irrational fear of seaweed (or river weed, or pond weed, or any type of water weed for that matter ) @PERSON1 that I would yelp or full out scream every time that some touched me. I thought it was fantastic that @PERSON1 just couldn't hold on to her sandals, @PERSON1 would end up making wild dives for them as they floated away. We both thought the way @PERSON1, the @CAPS4 that she is, was reluctant to get wet was preposterous. @PERSON1, naturally, we pushed her in numerous times. These are the things that make our relationship so special. We can be serious for each other when needed, @PERSON1 no one will disrespect my friends @PERSON1 get away with it, but when we are together, I can let my guard down @PERSON1 can be myself. My goofy, irrational, apparently hilarious self, @PERSON1 still have fun.  Our laughter can even change how a situation is going to progress. For example, after we were done on the river, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I went to @ORGANIZATION1 for an afternoon of music @PERSON1 food. We all got enormous ice cream cones, the best money can buy. My friends had already finished theirs, @PERSON1 were playing with @CAPS3 a few yards away. I was just about to take another heavenly lick of my waffle cone when the @CAPS3 the ball flies over @PERSON1 knocks all the ice cream right out of my cone! I was left with a completely intact cone, but all of the good stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. Who knows what would have happened if @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 hadn't started laughing. Maybe I would have teared up, or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was just so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they just couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in hysterics. Even through my disappointment I started cracking up as well, @PERSON1 then everything seemed okay. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other people I have ever met, @PERSON1 I suspect I will never meet anyone else that makes me feel as they do. This laughter we have makes us feel better. It helps us relax @PERSON1 let our guard down, so the times after we laugh together is often when we confide in each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or is under the weather, laughter is the sure fire way to get them back on their feet @PERSON1 smiling. Even simply being with them makes me feel more exuberant, lets me abandon my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship builds. It is the good times we have had that help us through the bad times, @PERSON1 I know that our good times wouldn't have been so good were it not for the way we can laugh together.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

20994,8,"                                         The @CAPS1 of Laughter  Many people think it is love that brings people together. But love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run. Before you've ever loved someone though, you've laughed with them. Laughter creates conversation, mends relationships, and brings joy to people. Its an important part of any relationship and has certainly helped me make friends.   In the kindergarten, everything was new to me. I got to leave my house, go to school, eat lunch, and go to recess. There were many children just like me, bouncing with excitement as our daily routine started. Although we played together at school, at home there was no one around to play with.   One day after school, I noticed a boy walking around next to my yard. I walked over and remembered him from that school day in my classroom.  ""@CAPS2"", was all I said. He turned around, and with all his might, burped as loud as he could. We fell into a fit of laughter and I knew I'd made a new friend that day. From then on, him and I were bestfriends. Any adventure that happened after school always ended with us laughing about something. There was no need for our parents to set up any ""playdates"" or scheduled time to meet other children because it was easier to laugh at something and make a friend naturally, not awkwardly while the parents chatted. From then on, making friends was a piece of cake.Through grade school and well into my teenage years, I had a best friend and a lot more friends, solely, because of a moment of laughter.  Laughing is something that can always ""break the ice"". Whenever you meet someone new, it's always kind of hard to just talk to them. You don't know whether to be serious, outgoing, funny, or quiet. But if something happens that makes both of you laugh, then it becomes easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension in between. It's like riding a bike, after the initial awkwardness, things just get easier and easier.  For many, laughter helps heal pain. Tragic things happen in every persons life and it can be hard to deal with at times. Whether it's a breakup, a depressive mood, or maybe even a death of a loved one, something funny and a laugh @MONTH1 help them get their mind off of whatever is bothering them. Most of them time that's all a person wants, something to help them forget what ever troubles them, if only for a few minutes. It's how people build better relationships, they do whatever they can for each other to make each other feel better.   Besides it's healing and conversation starting qualities, laughing is simply fun to do. It @MONTH1 start out as a small giggle, turn into a chuckle, and end up as a fifteen minute session of raging, side cramping laughter. And most of the time, you're with friends so they're enjoying the moment of fun and happiness right along with you.   If you've never laughed once in your life, there's something wrong. It will eliminate awkward moments, relieve painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant fun. Just try it, it's not that hard. I guarantee that it will bring you closer to someone, make life less stressful, and make you happy.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

20996,8,"When I was younger my sister and I would fight all the time. It would either be verbally or physically. Whatever we fought about we would drag on for hours. Not only would we get more upset as time went on, but my mom and family members got fed up. It didn't help that there was only @NUM1 months between us. It would make everything ten times more tense. My mom had a few tactics to try to get us to stop. One would be grounding us. But we shared a room so that would only make it worse. Another was giving us chores which took up both our time and was annoying , the last one was making us sit criss cross apple sauce, face eachother, and hold hands. We hated this one. But every time that we did it we would end up cracking up and forgetting what we were even fighting about. After we did this we would give eachother a hug and move on.

20998,8," Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change that view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concern in your darkest thoughts laughter can bring the sun. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and comfort for the old. We give not even the slightest thought to laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breath, we just do, it's a part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always appropriate, but it's something we revert back to in necessary times. Laughing makes dreams, hopes, and puts to rest the thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a friend, a helper, and an icebreaker to many leaving joy and hope to everyone that it meets. It's part of life we must cherish every moment we can.  Many times laughter has helped me, but one time sticks out more then the rest. A moment, a simple moment were laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; putting my life into motion. With shoulders slumped I listened to my six period teacher as she droned on about nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned I met eyes with a man I had never had spoken to, he watched me with curiosity waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, needed to talk to him so I took a chance. ""@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?"" he smiled and chuckled.without that the conversation would @CAPS1 been totally different. He could @CAPS1 ignored me, but he laughed and that altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we talked after I asked him that. That laugh made everything so simple, it made the puzzle fall into place. Moments @CAPS1 arise when laughing has dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing you still need to be careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when its not. Again a moment that sticks to me was a time when I was young. I played by myself for the most part picking up a barbie I brushed her hair,""@CAPS2 come here."" I heard my father call.I went to the living room where my brother already reside and waited with my barbie. My father kneel to talk,""@CAPS3 going to be leaving soon because she needs sometime. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS2 always remember that."" I bubbled with laughter, I didn't realize or even comprehend what was really going on. I laughed as we got into the car, by the time we were gone i realized how serious this issue was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but it hurt me for not taking it so serious.  Life is never know, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or drop us. Laughter is an emotion and can cure the wounds, but its also a power we must not mistreat or misuse. Giving us joy and fun, it helps pick us up when we fall and it rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity.",20.0,16.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay has a clear main idea and supporting details.

20999,8," Laughter? What is laughter? Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. My @CAPS5 has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, the @DATE1 of @DATE1, @CAPS2 , and @CAPS3. On my birthday the whole @CAPS5 gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When @LOCATION2 finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS5 meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. Which we always seem to miss at least one every year. While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. Then watching him try to climb down again. When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. On the @DATE1 every one has their own agenda that they fallow. My dad and me go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 to light @CAPS6 on the third of @DATE1 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so. Then on the @DATE1 my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  Then comes my favorite laughing day @CAPS2. My dad sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a @CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them. Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do. Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @CAPS3! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking. After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad ""A laugh a day will keep the @CAPS10 at @LOCATION1"".",19.0,18.0,,37.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

We were both excited because @CAPS1 dad would be the only one there. @CAPS1 mom and brother were out late. After eating popcorn and getting stuffed up on candy, we decided to try something new and fun. @CAPS1 house has a counter bar where four to five people can sit at and so @CAPS1 daddy decided to turn on some hip hop music. As though @PERSON1 and I could read each others minds we jumped on the counter and started doing the run way model walk. We worked it like no other. It was funny to see @CAPS1 dad pretending to be the fake photographer and say that's ""gorgeous"" as though he was a real photographer. @PERSON1 and I strutted up and down and did stops and poses and turns, until we got too dizzy. We all knew we could never do this with @CAPS1 mom @ORGANIZATION1 which made everything so funny! We all bursted out laughing until we couldn't breath! Later on after that fun model runway we decided to pillow surf down the stairs. I was a little afraid to at first but after I saw the look on @PERSON1's face, I knew I had to do it. I grabbed a big body pillow and surfed down those stairs like a champ! It was such a blast! @PERSON1 and I kept pillow @CAPS2 for what seems forever! @CAPS1 dad put on @ORGANIZATION1 and we laughed the rest of the night away.

21001,8," In my opinion, I think that laughter is a very important part of life. What would the world be like without laughter and jokes? It would be a very boring and dull place. I can't even imagine what it would be like. The world needs to have laughter in it. People need to make jokes and they need to have laughter and comedy in their life. I myself have a lot of laughter in my life. One day in fifth grade my best friend and I were jogging around the track for gym class. We were running together and talking and telling jokes to each other to help pass the time because it was really boring. I told this one really awesome joke, I can't remember what it was, and he started laughing so hard. We were both laughing together to the point we were crying. He fell down on the track, and rolled off into the grass. I said ""@CAPS1 on we need to keep going or the gym teacher will get mad"". He said, ""I can't, I just peed my pants!."" That made me laugh even more. He got up and walked over to the gym teacher. The gym teacher told my friend to go to the nurse's office. After gym class was over I met him back up with him in the classroom and he told me he called his mom and she brought him a new pair of underwear and pants. I wonder what his mom must have thought. It was a funny day.  We have always talked about that day together from then on. I would always jokingly make fun of him for peeing his pants, but I told him a funny joke. Our whole relationship was based on making each other laugh and telling jokes. Just all around the two of us being stupid together was what we did. Jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that I might possibly have for the rest of my life. At the same time, if you have no jokes and laughter in your friendship, it can make your relationship very boring and lame. If you do not have any, or little laughter in your friendship, then you do not have fun with that person and it makes you not want to hang around them because it just feels boring.  I have this other friend named @CAPS2, I occasionally go over to his house and we hang out and play video games together. The weird thing is, we hardly even communicate with each other. We just do stuff and don't have any fun with it. There is no jokes or laughter or anything awesome like that. We just play his video games silently not saying a word to the other person. Its the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. It is the most boring friendship two people could have. It is really boring over there because we just do the same thing over and over. I don't really like going over there that much. I would rather be at a different friends house having fun, but I still go over there anyway and I am not sure why. Without jokes and laughter in a friendship, it just makes things boring and not fun. It is something you definitely need to have. Laughter is not just an important element in a friendship, it is also an important element to have in a dating relationship. If you are dating somebody, then you absolutely need to have laughter in your relationship. If you look around you always see couples making jokes together and laughing with each other all the time, having fun. It makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable. Think about it, who wants to date a boring person that doesn't like to laugh and make jokes? Nobody wants to. So in a dating relationship you especially need laughter and comedy more than in a friendship. You want to keep things going good so the other person likes you and thinks your funny. That is one of the key things that makes a couple close. So as you can see by my three examples, laughter really makes a big difference in relationships and just in life in general. If you have laughter in a friendship it can really impact the relationship in a very good way. It makes it an interesting and fun relationship. Laughter makes people happy and get along with each other. If you are feeling down, laughter can always bring you up and make you feel better. It is almost like a medicine. If you do not have laughter, it can really make things suck, and make the relationship boring. Nobody wants that. People do not want a boring, lifeless relationship with somebody. Laughter is something that bring people together in a good way. It brings all of my friends together and makes us better friends. We have a good time and really enjoy ourselves. Laughter is a great thing that everybody needs to have in their life. ",20.0,21.0,,41.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21002,8,"                            From Laughter to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the first day of school last year, I walked through the doors of the school hoping I would make a friend or two. I was not sure of how this would happen but I hoped for the best. I entered my first class and sat at a table with all unknown faces. I wanted to say something but was afraid of their reactions. The teacher made us play a couple games where we had to introduce ourselves. Those didn't really help. Everybody was tense and it was all awkward. I @CAPS3 wanted to be myself already and make friends. For the rest of the day, all my classes were like that. Everybody was tense and awkward, like something was keeping us quiet. Not knowing anybody didn't help the situation a bit. That was the first day for me. The second day I walk through the school doors determined to make some friends. I thought about what jokes I could say, what interesting thing about myself I could share, but to me all those sounded like stupid ideas. I walk into humanities and sat at a table with a friendly looking girl. The teacher told us to introduce ourselves to the other students at the table we were sitting at. For a minute or so it was very silent, but i wanted to introduce myself so bad. I couldn't stand this silence any longer. I looked in by back pack to grab a pencil and I see a note from my mom saying "" @CAPS4 be yourself and make some friends honey, have a great day at school. :) "". I started laughing because I thought it was funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my back pack. It was so unexpected and I felt like a child. I started laughing and when I looked up, I saw that the girl next to me was laughing too. I knew I had to say something, so I did. I said, "" @CAPS5 my names @PERSON1, but you can call me @CAPS4 for short. Whats your name? "". The girl looked at me, smiled, and said, "" @CAPS5, my names @CAPS8"". Then I asked her what middle school she came from and other questions. We stared talking, we exchanged numbers, and we became good friends. From laughter to @CAPS1, who would have known? A year has gone by and we are still friends. We always laugh about how we started talking. A few days ago I told her how I felt @CAPS2 that second day of school. I told her I was scared to introduce myself. She said she felt the same way and she didn't know what to do either. Since then I thank my mom for writing that note because without it I wouldn't have laughed and made @CAPS8 laugh and I wouldn't have made such a great friend.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"The `response.text` quick accessor only works when the response contains a valid `Part`, but none was returned.

21003,8," It's the first day of high school and your gut is full of butterflies that make you want to run to the bathrooms and hide from the world. I had @CAPS7 friends yet and I was to shy to go and join any of the groups so I walked to all of my classes alone. Students would get in my face wanting to know what school I came from and wanted to know all about me. I remember wanting to be left alone, hidden in my own bubble space. Girls would ask @CAPS5 I was upset since I wasn't smiling or having fun getting to know my new classes. Lunch was much more crowded than my old school. Students would sit in hallways eating their lunch or crowd around one big table chattering loudly to one another. I chewed on my lip looking for a spot that wasn't occupied by students. I found a table near the front of the lunch room that was empty and placed my brown lunch sack in front of me eating my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and settled down next to me laughing at one another for not getting a seat next to me.""@CAPS1 I'm @PERSON3, what's your name?"" was a skinny boy in a black caps response to me. ""@PERSON1"" was all I replied to all of them who stared at me the entire time.""That's a pretty name, I'm @LOCATION1, this is @LOCATION2, you just met @PERSON3, and @PERSON4 is the funny kid next to you with his orange back pack,"" I smiled and nodded to them @ORGANIZATION2 had on a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 t-shirt and @PERSON2 had on a military uniform that said @CAPS4. They all ate lunch at the school and got pizza or sub sandwiches. They showed pictures of funny events on their phones to everyone even including me.""@CAPS5 that kid isn't careful he might get razor rash."" I said laughing a little looking at the picture of a little boy sliding down a slide that looked like a cheese grader. @PERSON3 took off all his pepperoni and was flinging it randomly in the air. @PERSON2 was going to take a picture of everyone for picture id on her phone. @PERSON4 was next for his picture to be taken when the pepperoni in @LOCATION3's hands slipped and landed smack on @ORGANIZATION1's face. I busted up laughing and everyone at the table joined in. @PERSON3 and I were clenching our stomachs and wiping away tears. @PERSON4 went to the bathroom to wash away the smell from his face and when he returned @PERSON2 said,""@CAPS6 my word you should see your face I took your picture right after the pepperoni hit your face and your picture is just hilarious, your mouth is hanging open like your going to eat something and like your angry."" @PERSON2 handed her phone to one person at a time and we all started to laugh again asking for @PERSON2 to send the picture to each of them.""I was wondering @CAPS5 I could be your guys friend?"" I asked looking them all in the eye. @ORGANIZATION2 was the only one to respond,""@CAPS7 you can't be our friend, @PERSON1 duh @CAPS5 we didn't want to be your friend then we wouldn't be hanging out with you."" @ORGANIZATION2 teased. My twisted gut loosened with re-leaf.""@CAPS8 we probably would have made some excuse to leave,"" @PERSON3 smiled. I laughed at myself for worrying that I wouldn't fit in or have friends who could make me laugh as hard as I did when the pepperoni stuck to @LOCATION4's face.",20.0,16.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The writing is clear and focused.

21004,8,"Laughter can sometimes be something that everyone shares together, sometimes it's used only for few as it's aimed against one another. But hopefully most of the time it's something that we all can share. Laughter opens up a relationship to where people can feel more comfortable with one another. Someone could be a complete stranger to one another and then just by a simple joke, laughter could make them look like they've been friends for years. Now laughing isn't the only thing that helps people become acquainted with one another, they can share similar hobbies or likes and dislikes, but most of the time laughter is something that everyone needs in a relationship.

Some people have to work @NUM1 jobs to support a family and we're over here complaining about @CAPS1 we have to wake up and go to school, we laughed at @CAPS1 pathetic we sounded. A couple of days later we found ourselves thinking about what we wanted to do when we older and out of high school. @PERSON1 said he wants to be a taekwando instuctor and that he's already got a small job at one, I said ""@CAPS1 did you get the job?"", he replied ""I kicked a kid in the face pretty hard when my instuctor was watching"".

21005,8,"     Laughter @CAPS1 is one the most important things in life. People shouldn't go a day without @CAPS1. It's healthy and good in any relationship. It can also help with healing. The best kind of laughter is when you're out of breath and crying. It makes people so happy and wanting more. Don't take life too seriously, just laugh and smile all the time.  Someone dying is a dreadful thing. When two high school boys die, it's even worse. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, a group of high school students were walking on the rocks by the ocean, when a sneaker wave snatched two of them. The other kids tried so hard to save them by making a rope of clothing to reach them, but it didn't work. Two beautiful lives were taken away that day, and will not be forgotten. The boys were well liked and had great lives. The families of the students, the school, friends and the community were in shock, and couldn't believe the terrible news. How could this happen to such amazing people.  Hundreds of students gathered at church the following @DATE2, most in tears. They talked about the two boys, and had a huge group prayer. Friends spoke well of them, missing them greatly, talking about the good, fun, memorable times. @CAPS1 can make it better. As someone once said, smile because they lived, don't cry because they're gone. At the school's basketball game, they honored the boys, and won the game for them. Parents and friends spoke about the beautiful kids in front of almost @NUM1 people, that came to support the school. The game was a time for having a good time and not to sob and mope. This game helped heal the community just a little more. @CAPS1 and cheering really can help the heart.  As days, weeks, and months go on, people will still be heartbroken. Although, as long as we laugh and smile about the good times of those who left, we can make it though anything. @CAPS1 makes you feel better. It just shows you that you have to make the best with what you have, and always have a fun time with no regrets. Always tell the people that mean something to you, that you love them. Never stop telling people you love them, and never leave in a fight. You don't know when it might be the last time you see them. @CAPS1 is so important, and without it life would not be as great as it is.",15.0,17.0,,32.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay provides a clear and focused narrative about the importance of laughter, particularly in the context of a tragic event.

21006,8," People can share many things. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would. When I was younger it was the typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE3 we were together constantly. We would watchJerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday @TIME1 @CAPS1, that's where I introduced her to the character ""@CAPS2"". @PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from ""@CAPS2"" and laugh constantly about @NUM1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 is also where we adapted the ""demonic voice"". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that @DATE1. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other.  The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON3 you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she ""moved out"" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; ""Laughter is the best medicine"" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"" ""@CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM2 minutes""; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing.",20.0,18.0,36.0,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21007,8,"One day i was going to my friend @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1's house for her @NUM1 birthday party. I knew the birthday party was going to be a lot of fun even though it was only going to be @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 and I. I didn't know it was going to be as fun as it turned out to be though. The whole day i was waiting for it to be @NUM2 so i could go to her house. I packed all my bags and got everything ready, because it was a sleep over. As i was one my way to her she called me and said ""before you get to my house look to the right.""  The whole way my dad and i were driving to her house i kept my eyes on the right side of the rode, i wasn't quit sure what i was looking for though. As we got closer i saw something in the bushes. It was @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON2. I told my dad to honk at them so they knew i was there and as he did, they both pulled down there pants and mooned us! I was laughing so hard the whole night i kept thinking about the look on my dads face! Little did i know that wasn't going to be the funniest thing that happened that night. Later on @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2 and I went on a walk down to the dock by @LOCATION1 house. While we were on the dock a bat flew by and @PERSON2 almost fell in the water cause she was so scared. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were standing behind her laughing so hard! By that time it was getting kind of dark and her neighbors were being really loud. So we ran from the dock to her neighbors house and hid and started yelling things at them to quiet down! It was so funny because they had no idea where the yells were coming from so they just kept looking around confused. We started laughing so hard we could hardly be quiet. We had to wait a while for her neighbors to stop looking around trying to figure out who was telling them to be quiet. That's not the funniest thing that happened either! As we were walking back to @LOCATION1 house we heard a car coming so we made a plan I stood in the middle of the street and @ORGANIZATION1 stood ahead of me while @PERSON2 was hiding in the bushes. The plan was @ORGANIZATION1 and I were going to pretend to be in a fight and @PERSON2 was going to run out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me. So the car starts turning the corner and me and @ORGANIZATION1 start fake fighting. As the car gets closer it starts slowing down and here come @PERSON2 running out of the bushes and @CAPS2! Pretends to fake shoot me. I fall to the ground like i am really hurt trying to hold back my laughs, and man did we think we got the people in the car good. Then we realize there is no way she actually shot me when there was no gun shot sound at all! So the people in the car come up closer and they are laughing so hard that we can hear them before we can even see who it is. When they got closer we realized it was just some of @ORGANIZATION1's family friends coming over for the party so they knew it was fake the whole time. When it got darker outside we found a huge watermelon and took it out to a bridge by @LOCATION1 house. We brought her video camera and put it on night vision and threw the watermelon of the bridge. When it hit the water it mad a really loud sound and split into a bunch of tiny pieces! That night was one of the best and funniest nights i have ever had. The next day all the fun continued by going to the lake and swinging on rope swings into the water. @ORGANIZATION1 got a really bad rope burn and it was hilarious! @PERSON2, @ORGANIZATION1 and I always have the best time together and tons of laughs. A lot more happened that night, it was overall a great @NUM1 birthday for @ORGANIZATION1. I'm glad i got to be there with her for it.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21008,8," We all have had times when some thing happened and you just thought of it as a nuisance. But looking back on the same occurrence you just have to laugh at how silly it was. I recall one of these experiences when I went on a motorcycle camping trip this @DATE1. It was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the beginning of the main logging road of the area. I decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery. Later that day I found a picturesque place to camp for a few nights on the river. In the @TIME1, I remembered some spurs off the main road from when I have driven with my brother in these woods and decided to go explore some of them near my camp. I decided to go check out one across the river that looked like a fun ride. As I was crossing the it my front tire hit some lose rocks causing me to fall into the water! Thankfully I fell away from my motorcycle, if I hadn't it could very well have fallen on me which, out in the woods by myself, would have put me in quite the predicament. After getting my @ORGANIZATION1 up and out of the water I headed back to camp to dry my clothes off, seeing as how I only brought one set with me. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up I realized that the sun had been up for some time now so I decided that I had better get going on another ride before the day's out. This time I stayed on my side of the water and went up a steep road that lead up to the top of the ridge. As I climbed it became increasingly warm then I broke through the woods and witnessed a glorious sight. The sun was just cresting the ridge in front of me and I had to stop and bask in the sun shine. After a while of just sitting I got going again. The road I was on started to taper down into a valley. At the bottom of it, flood waters had washed large quantity's of silt over the road and it was still muddy. As I crossed it my wheels started spinning out and flinging mud at me as a result I ended up very dirty. Once again I headed back to camp to wash my clothes in the river. This time I didn't fall a sleep for quite some time and when I did it was a fit full one.upon waking I packed up my meager supply's and headed out to complete my journey. Most of a day got me only half way to my destination so I was forced to stop and rest for the night. Just setting out my tent and getting out some food for dinner and breakfast in the @TIME1 didn't take me very long. Having little to occupy my time I just sat by my fire and pondered my trip and life in general. When I fell asleep I slept soundly until @TIME1. Waking to the sound of birds chirping and the river rushing by me was delightful and invigorating. It only took me a few hours to reach where my dad was going to meet me and take me home.This trip helped me think and gater my thoughts. It also helped me enjoy the little things in life that we so often take for granted. Looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor set backs. All in all it was a very good time to gather my thoughts and renew my soul.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The writing is clear and focused.

21009,8," Laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them. It is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad. Laughter is pretty much a sign of happiness, as crying is of sadness. It is just another natural emotion any person is born with. I agree to the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many moments in life together where they are happy. It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as for they won't take everything personally and can understand a joke. Its always good to have a sense of humor because its something everyone appreciates, also, that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't have to be serious. When your with a group of friends that you get along with very well, one of the main things you will hear is laughter. It shows that you get along and that your having a good time.  Of course there are times when its better not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, which often gets annoying. Yes laughing means your happy, but when its not needed and is used just to cause noise, it is better to be quiet than annoy everyone around you. In my group of friends we are always laughing and joking around with each other, i like when people have a good sense of humor, i feel more relaxed and its easier to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything as a joke and never take anything seriously. Even though it is natural, you have to know when you can and cant laugh. Its a way to show happiness, but in certain situations, it can be disrespectful or rude.  Sometimes when I'm with my friends, they @MONTH1 joke around about a certain person, and once it happened like this;at my friends birthday party, we all went to a bowling alley and as always, were all standing around talking and having a good time. While we were talking, @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 were joking around about something so we all started listening to their conversation. They were joking around about something and then @PERSON3 said something as to turn him down in some way, ask a joke, and @PERSON4 said that hes going to get his heart broken. Right after that was said, @ORGANIZATION1 pitched in, adding again. So it turned out to sound like @PERSON4 was going to have his heart broken again. As everyone laughed at it, @PERSON4 looked at @ORGANIZATION1 with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing. You see, @PERSON4 had a girlfriend that broke up with him about two months ago, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about that and didn't mean anything when she added ""again"". She meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean. In this case, the laughter caused by @ORGANIZATION1 was meant for @PERSON4, who was hurt by @ORGANIZATION1's comment. Good thing @ORGANIZATION1 noticed and remembered about @PERSON4's ex later that day. She ended up apologizing for saying something she should have thought through more carefully before saying.  How a person takes it when people laugh at them, has a lot to do with friendship. One time, my friends were driving to a party, or home from a party and were listening to music in the car, one of the guys in the car was singing his heard out to a song by @PERSON1. At one point, while he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone in the car heard @PERSON2 sing really loud, with no music. Everyone started laughing because @PERSON2 didn't know that @CAPS1 would turn off the music in the middle of something. Even though it was kind of embarrassing, @PERSON2 laughed along because it was pretty funny. If @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 weren't such good friends, i think for sure @PERSON2 would have gotten mad at @CAPS1 for doing such a thing to him while there where other people in the car aside from just them two. Friends understand each others sense of humor, and know when doing something is going to far, or when the other person will think it's funny too and will laugh along. So as you see, laughter can be happy, thankful, annoying, and or mean, you just have to know when it's okay to do, and when it is better not to laugh. Even though it's a natural reaction, it is one that can be controlled and thought about before doing. Next time someone says something that's funny, first think about if it can be insulting to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and be happy.",17.0,16.0,,33.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,3,,":**

21010,8," One day I decided to go over to my friend @PERSON1's house. When I went over there we cleaned the pool and i ran from her dad because he was chasing me around with a booger on his finger. This was one of the days that me and @PERSON1 laughed more then ever!  We started the day just laying in her bad and watching a movie on her tiny @CAPS1. I can't really remember what movie is was but it doesn't really matter since we were too busy talking about totally random things.  After the movie was over we went out into the living room to watch @CAPS2 bob because @PERSON1 doesn't have cable in her room. At the time, I had a knee injury so it took me a minute to get comfortable. I got myself situated on the couch and @PERSON1 sat next to me. Her dad came in about @NUM1 minutes later with a booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me booger lip, which is where he puts the booger on your lip, and I got up and tried to run away. I knew if I didn't get away he would really put in on my lip because he had done it before. it hurt really bad putting that much pressure on my knee so I hoped as fast as I could on one leg. I hid in @PERSON1's closet and all I could hear in the background was @PERSON1's laughter and her dads footsteps. I waited in her closet for like @NUM2 minutes and the got out because I could tell the coast was clear. I went back out in the living room and @PERSON1 and I laughed about the whole thing.  After we stopped laughing we decided to go outside and clean the pool. we were in the mood for swimming and the pool had been out all winter so it was really nasty in there. there were tat poles, dirt, some slimy green stuff, parasites and who knows what else. I wouldn't be surprised if there were fish in there. We got in and started scooping all of the water out with buckets. We didn't notice the tad poles until then. We didn't want to throw them out in the yard with all of the rest of the water because we knew that there would dry up and die. So every time we scooped a bucket full of water, we would go through it and get all of them out and put them in a little can that we had saved the tad poles and scooping all of the water out took about @NUM3 and a half hours. after that we went in the house and looked for some pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find and so we went and got the shampoo. We poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. That was taking too long and it wasn't very fun so we got the brilliant idea to put shampoo all over our clothes and slide around. I slipped about a dozen times and so did she. It was hard to stay on our feet. We laughed so hard I almost peed myself but I couldn't go inside because I was soaked and I had soap all over my body. After the pool was all spick and span we had to scoop all out the soap and water out again. All of this took about @NUM4 hours but it was really and we laughed a lot. @PERSON1's mom came home from work and was so happy that we cleaned it because it meant she doesn't have to do it.  After my grandpa came to get me, me and @PERSON1 said our goodbyes. I went home and thought about how that was one of the funnest days of my life. Over all, I think on this day I laughed more then ever before.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21013,8,I think that laughter is very important. It is very important to me because let's say that a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think its funny it's going to hurt that student. I think that instead of laughing at someone that you could be a good kid and ask him if he is ok and help him up. That shows that student that he really has a friend that cares about him alot and doesn't laugh at him and really cares about his best friend. You also can get rewarded for doing something good but to me it's really not about what I get it's the things i do to help out my peer's . I think that we should not laugh and have a positive attitude and be mature about what we do and what we say and reacact to things like laughing at someone else. I also think that if I would have fell and I got really hurt and kids would start laughing at me so thats what I learn respect the students the way that you want to be respected. So I wouldnt like people to make fun of me so why would I like to make fun of someone else if I wouldnt want them to make fun of me thats why you should treat your peers with respect.,10.0,17.0,24.0,24.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

21015,8," The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 extreme temperatures occur, the situation becomes very dangerous. In my case, the extreme weather was @CAPS1. I lived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at this time and was eight years old. It happened in the middle of @DATE1, @CAPS3 an almost record high temperature occurred @LOCATION2. The day had peaked at one hundred twenty five degrees @CAPS4, and to make matters much worse, our entire neighborhoods power had gone out. Nobody had air conditioning and many people ended up getting severely sick or injured. We lived in a gated community, and everyone got along great. People from the neighborhood gathered together and put up tents for shade, and provided everyone with cold water. There are important things that you must remember @CAPS3 a situation like this happens, you must have a good attitude, because it's no help to be complaining, also to not think about the @CAPS1, and to help other people who need it. I don't think that our community would have lasted, if it weren't of everyone's great attitude and spirit, and of course, the laughter. It is so important to have a good attitude during a situation like this. What is the point of complaining and getting mad for no reason? I was told that it would not last forever, and to keep my chin up. I could tell that the many other kids, and even adults who were complaining were have a much harder time coping with this situation. It was very hard for me no not complain, being an eight year-old, but I eventually managed with the help of a lot of water. If you keep your spirits up, and interact with people, the say seems to go by much faster. I remember @CAPS3 my whole family was under one of the tents, just sitting around telling funny stories, and telling jokes. I would have much rather had a day like that with my family than a normal, boring one. Out of the many important things you could possibly do, is to not think about the @CAPS1. If you don't think about it, then you will have a much better time and not be complaining. It is important in many situations to keep your mind off the topic so you won't be stressed out. I saw many people there who just couldn't take it. They would only say how bad it was, and it was very easy to tell that they were all stressed out. If you try to make the situation a good one, and not keep thinking about it, then you will get through it, no matter how bad it is. During this @CAPS2 of @CAPS1, many people needed assistance. The community was a big help because they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks. However, it started to get bad, people were suffering from @CAPS1 exhaustion, and many of them had to be put on @CAPS5's. There were several ambulances there to help people out and get them back to normal. Some people did need to go to the hospital and get further attention. The community eventually got through the day with so serious injuries. The power came back on at around six o'clock. Being exhausted the people slowly walked or drove back to their houses. Our whole family walked back to the house and immediately turned on the air conditioning. Everyone was so relieved and happy that we were finally out of that situation. Even at night, the day was at a low of one hundred twelve degrees. We played games and told jokes the rest of the night and were able to get through it all. Our family had stayed strong through the @CAPS1, while many others didn't last. It just goes to show that ,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21016,8," Laughter is such a great joy in my life. If people never laughed life would be dull and boring, most of my favorite experiences involve @CAPS9 while having a good time. One of my best experiences with laughter was going camping with my friends last @DATE2. I will never forget that experience last @DATE2.  During the middle of @DATE2 on a beautiful sunny @DATE1 @TIME1 my @CAPS4 @CAPS1 calls me and @CAPS2 me were getting a bunch of guys to go camping and I should come. Immediately I @CAPS3 my parents to let me go with the only exception of turning in my job application to @ORGANIZATION1 before I left for camping. After turning in my application I got in the car picked up my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 and makings for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and left for the adventure.  After I got to my destination after driving @NUM1 miles up river I didn't see anyone just two huge tents where my friends were supposed to be. Looking @CAPS5 the camp site had been attacked by bears with trash laying all around and camp fire still going i started searching for my friends. I found @CAPS1 passed out in one of the tents and tried to wake him but he was dead asleep. @PERSON3 and me not knowing what to do so we sat in the shade of the large trees surrounding us, it was a good @NUM2 degrees outside. After about five minuets we herd a splash and went to investigate. We walked towards the river and found all of out friends jumping off a @NUM3 ft rock into the river and we went to join the fun. After jumping off about @NUM4 times each we headed back to camp. @CAPS1 was awake and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS7, @PERSON3 and myself all huddled around the camp fire @CAPS8 we returned to camp and told jokes all night.  All of us really bonded that three day camping trip @CAPS9 and joking and just being boys. I wouldn't get rid of those memory's for anything. After camping i returned to home and worked a lot of the rest of @DATE2 but ever since then have had really good friendships with all of my camping buddies.",16.0,15.0,,31.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,3,,":** The essay has a clear main idea about the importance of laughter in the writer's life.

21021,8," My @CAPS1 year of high school started off less favorable than most. During the end of my eighth grade year I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship, and in turn started high school without any. It wasn't all bad because I was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course I sulked but looking back on it now I am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better. However one can't go through life without any friends so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered 'normal'. I had luck from the start, but I was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who I once considered friends and in turn took these recipients as little more than acquaintances. Like most acquaintances we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have 'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I suppose that these so called acquaintance considered me a friend though I can never be sure whether or not this is true. So I continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch. This circumstance however was made more desirable because my sister still attended the high school at this point.  Her presence made my life slightly easier because I could confide in her and even eat lunch with her. People who have always had friends @MONTH1 not understand, but when you have no where to sit at lunch it can be kind of lonely. Fortunately my sister was always there for me, though she did skip a lot of school. And whenever she wasn't there I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends I could always share my sisters. This nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my @CAPS1 year. I had all knew classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and truly anything I could imagine did.  It started out the same as the trimester before had. I went to my first couple classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if thing might not change after all. However after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held it. I knew that it was wrong to listen to others conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to hear they would have spoke quietly. Though I can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now, I remember it was a hilarious topic. Even though I took no part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke. They then began to laugh so hard which resulted in tears filling their eyes. In turn my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter. One of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to ""look at her, shes laughing so hard at you shes crying!"" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before i knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring to strangers together into best friends.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

I was very curious about @PERSON1, what she was like, what part of @LOCATION3 she lived in, how were her costumes different than ours. So i started to ask her some questions as we waited. I didn't get much it was obvious that she was shy, very shy. Finlay I got a conversation going between the three us us about the fire works that had started. @PERSON1 was telling us how the fire works back home in @LOCATION3 were much bigger than ours. Of course me being sarcastic i said ""@CAPS2 really"". She just smiled. the rest of the @TIME1 the conversations flowed much freer between me and @PERSON1 and it was a wonderful evening. Next we have the day at the beach. This happened about @DATE1 for the @TIME1 memory. @PERSON1 and me were good friends and she had lost her shyness and i was starting to really like her. We arrived at the beach the beach down on the @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1. It was starting to becoming a hot day, a perfect day for the beach. We unpacked the towels and other random beach stuff. Soon all of us were in the water, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 (@PERSON1's host sister), @CAPS4 (@CAPS1's boyfriend), and me. In a bit of a flirting mood I started to splash @PERSON1 who happened to be by @CAPS1. This started a very large splash war with every one splashing everyone else. Every one was laughing and having a great time. It abruptly stopped because everyone didn't want water in there face any more. Soon there after I dove under the water an tried to lift @PERSON1 up and then drop her in the water, it underlay failed though because I missed and only caught her right leg. Nothing happened, just more and more laughter. That was a good wet day at the beach. Finally, my @TIME1 memory is the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. We had just finished eating dinner and it was @PERSON1's @TIME1 in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. By now we were practically boyfriend girlfriend. It was getting dark at @LOCATION2 @LOCATION4 as we arrived at the @LOCATION4 forMovies in the @LOCATION4.. @TIME1 at the @CAPS7 was playing that @TIME1. I found a good spot and set out the blanket. we lay there talking as we waited for the movie to start. I had a flash back of all the laughs that had brought us close together. I knew at moment that I was really going to miss her more than i had missed anyone befor. It felt like the right moment as the sun was setting over the valley, I leaned in and kissed her and she kissed right back, I'll spare you the rest. Afterward we laughed and cried. For she was leaving early the next morning and we were in love. Yes I used the @CAPS8 world but it was and is true. We absolutely did not want the movie to end and yet it still did. As I drove her back to her host family's house we talk about the amazing @DATE3 we had together and all the smiles and laughs we shared. I smiled and laughed a lot that @DATE3 and it did bring me very close to someone. @PERSON1 and I still talk nearly every day it is hard but I've never felt as close to her as any one else. I will always have the memories of that @DATE3, the @DATE2 of @DATE2, That day at the beach, and @PERSON1""s @TIME1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION1. I hope you enjoyed the story of my @DATE3 and I hope you can have an amazing @DATE3 ,like I had.",19.0,18.0,,37.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21023,8," Summertime is always the highlight of the year for teenagers. It's when temperatures are the highest, we are able to stay out later, and its when we have the best memories of our childhood that we will never forget. It seems like there is never a dull moment when it comes to that time of year. Everyone seems to always get together and find something crazy and fun to do. @CAPS2, @LOCATION1, and I were sitting at home with nothing to do and decided that we were hungry. Without us having a car, we have to walk everywhere so we chose the closest place to @LOCATION1's house, which was at the time, @ORGANIZATION1. We left @ORGANIZATION1's at about ten o clock and started walking around, trying to find something to do. We texted @CAPS1 and found out that he was with @PERSON1 so we all decided that we wanted to hang out at @ORGANIZATION2's house. We had absolutely no idea where he lived so they told us to meet them at the skate park. By then, it was pretty dark and we were still walking. When we got to the park, it was pretty late. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 arrived a couple minutes later so we started walking towards @ORGANIZATION2's house.  @PERSON1 has the most evil cat i have ever met. @CAPS1 has told me stories and showed me videos about that cat a million times before. When we got there, it was bouncing off the walls and @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and I were scared of it. We didn't want it anywhere close to us because we thought it was going to attack us, eventually it did a couple of times. @PERSON1 was pointing the laser pointer all over the place for the cat to chase it and we were just sitting there, still bored. They were looking through our purses and saw that we had bathing suits because we went to the beach earlier, that gave them the wonderful idea of going fishing at one in the @TIME1. We all piled in the car and headed for the dike. We got there in our tank tops and short shorts and it was freezing. We were huddling for warmth. We couldn't see the ground and kept tripping over little holes and tree trunks everywhere. We finally got to a little dock that looked like it was ready to break and sink at any moment. @PERSON1 grabbed his @CAPS3 fishing pole and marched his way to the edge of the dock. There was no way the rest of us could all stand on it without breaking. We were taking a ton of pictures and had a ton of fun watching @PERSON1 try and fish and @CAPS1 just being @CAPS1.  In the end, we found something to do out of nothing. When people experience the greatness in little things they realize that they could enjoy everything a lot more. That night was one of the most memorable nights of that @DATE1. ",15.0,19.0,,34.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21024,8,I was about ten when this story happened to me. I was with my grandma when the story happened. We were at the park and I put my head in the monkey bars. My grandma had went to the bathroom and I was stick in the monkey bars.The kids at the park thought it was funny and were laughing at me. I was really embarrassed.When I got my head out of the monkey bars I told the kids that they should try putting there head in the monkey bars. The other kids tried doing it and they all got there heads stuck in the monkey bars. The kid did not know that I had practiced putting my head in the monkey bars so that it would not get stuck. I was laughing very hard at what I had just done and when my grandma came out I asked if we could go home. The next day we went back to the park and I got some different kids with the same trick. What I don't get is if my head was stuck why would they try the same thing. The kids this time told there mom and dad what I did and they told my grandma and I got in a lot of trouble.We went home and I was grounded for about two weeks.

21025,8,"                                  Friendship and Laughter go @CAPS1 in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 best friend and I would spend hours sitting on her bed laughing at nothing. We could tell stories to each other that, to other people would just be stupid, but to us were hilarious. We would stay up all night long watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying. But that was all before the big fight. We have had fights before but none like this. I knew that the decision I would make would ruin our friendship, and take away all of our laughter, but I couldn't let her get away with what she had done. So i said goodbye. @CAPS3 best friends name is @CAPS4, we have known each other sense we were two and have been inseparable sense then. We love to hang out and be together. That was until the fight were I was told that she had been telling lies about a boy and I. I remember the hurt and how disappointing it was to hear that she would do that to me. But I didn't care enough to ask her about it, so I ended the friendship. It hurt but I had talked myself into believing that it was all true. But something didn't feel right, something told me that it wasn't her. But I didn't want to hear it. I ignored the feeling and just went on with life. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in @CAPS3 life. School was a whole other story, it's really hard to stay mad at someone when you have the same friends and a couple classes together. It was like I had to keep reminding myself ""your not friends anymore, you don't have to talk to her"", like subconsciously i didn't want to end the friendship. I missed talking to her, so one day I said hello, after that we talked nonstop, it was like nothing had ever happened between us. Except there was one thing missing, the laughter. Sense then we have become closer, we hadn't talked about the fight, but it got to the point to where we could occasionally laugh or giggle at something one of us had said, but never the kind of the laughs that we used to share. I never thought that we would have been able to speak, nevertheless be friends again.  After a few weeks we both sighed up for a youth camp. During that camp I found out the truth. We talked about the whole ordeal and came to the agreement that the whole fight had been both of our faults. Mine because I didn't want to know the truth, and her's because she didn't try hard enough to show me the truth. During that talk we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months actually laughed together. The tension between us broke and fell of our shoulders like a very heavy pack that we both had been carrying. We both apologized for our parts in everything and then went to dinner, and laughed throughout the meal. I realize now that I can't take laughter for granted, it's a very important piece of life and you laugh the most when you are with people you love. Sam and I are still working things out between us but we are on our way to being closer than ever. We laugh all the time and never have a dull moment, we have both decided to work very hard at not having another fight between us. We have both realized that there are two very important things in life and they are friendship and laughter inside of the friendship. I love @CAPS3 best friend very much and I love the laughter that we share together just as much, and I don't want to lose that again. So everyday I'm going to make sure that we laugh as much as possible and I'm never going to take our friendship for granted again.",18.0,22.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,3,,":**

21026,8,"               Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought""@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home.""I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,""@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM1 and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there.

21028,8," In the @DATE1, a primary group of friends would search for different adventures to part take in. This group of people consisted of kids of all ages, @PERSON5@NUM1, @PERSON1@NUM2, @PERSON2@NUM3, and @PERSON4@NUM4. Around late @DATE2, on a hot day, @PERSON5 got an idea to head over to @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2 and go cliff diving. He called it the ""cliffs"". So the whole group got together and took off on an hour car ride to @LOCATION2. Once they got there, it only got hotter outside, and the need for cooling off was getting to be a priority. They parked, then walked the train tracks. The closer they got to they're destination, the louder the voices that they @CAPS1 hearing became. The spot was a secluded area with a rocky floor, people getting a running start to jump off the highest peak and go crashing on to the waters surface below. Right away @PERSON5 and @PERSON1 wanted to get settled so that they could join the others. As for @PERSON4 and @PERSON2, it could wait. Once @PERSON1 and @PERSON5 got they're first couple jumps in, @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 thought that maybe it was time to try it. But not from the highest peak. Maybe something a bit lower. Something like the very bottom of the cliff, just for starters. Before they jumped off they noticed a little beach on the other side of the creek, so the girls conversed with the boys and they all decided to jump off at the same time, and swim to the little beach. Although they all jumped from different heights, they all seemed to arrive around the same time. For @PERSON5 it was a bit more of a struggle to swim that far. But @PERSON4 was right by his side helping him along the way. As the group relaxed in the @DATE1 air for a while, they became to realize that they @CAPS1 hungry, but much to lazy to swim back, climb up the rocks, and walk the train tracks back to the car. But hunger was taking over. As they swam back, climbed the rocks, gathered they're belongings and headed back, they started brainstorming for a place to eat. ""@CAPS1 going to be going through @CAPS2."" @PERSON1 said. ""@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1!"" @PERSON4 shouted. At that moment the decision was made. On the ride back, they switched drivers and sitting arrangements. Once they got to @CAPS2 they all stopped at @ORGANIZATION1 and filled they're stomach's up. They all chose to stop at @PERSON5 work @ORGANIZATION3, to say hi to some of his friends. @PERSON4 was @PERSON5 girlfriend so they had some showing off to do. They all finished up saying they're hello's, and went back to @LOCATION1 house where all the cars @CAPS1 parked. @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 decided to shower, while @PERSON1 wanted to play some video games, as for @PERSON2, she headed to home to shower and get ready to meet back up with her friends.  @NUM5 hours later, they all headed to they're hang-out spot, which they referred to as ""the spot"". They invited a couple of they're friends @PERSON6@NUM3, and @PERSON3@NUM7. They made a camp fire while the sun was setting because it grew to get colder, and colder. While @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON6 and @PERSON2 @CAPS1 sitting around the fire in chairs, @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 @CAPS1 riding around the camp site (which was really a huge hunk of @PERSON5 mom's land) on a quad. The group would take turns riding the quad but one ride in particular, made some memories. Once @PERSON5 and @PERSON4 came back, @PERSON2 wanted to give @PERSON4 a ride around. So @PERSON5 hopped off, and @PERSON2 hopped on, as @PERSON4 wrapped her arms around her waist, and they took off.  There was a certain trail where there was a long in the way of riding, so the driver would always have to find a way to maneuver around it. Usually it worked, this time it didn't. @PERSON2 hesitated to just ride right over it. She was afraid of all the power. @PERSON4 really didn't seem to care, and she took over and slammed on the gas. They high tailed it on the log and rolled the quad right over. @PERSON4 didn't weigh that much so she flew off, @PERSON2 on the other had got her foot caught under the handle. @PERSON4 got the strength to lift the quad off her foot, and @PERSON2 got right out. @PERSON4 decided to call the boys, and they hopped right into @PERSON1 to come save them. @PERSON5 flipped the quad right over and got on it and drove back behind the @PERSON1.  This memory will never be forgotten with in the group, even if the group will never be the same.",17.0,15.0,,32.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21030,8," I moved to the @LOCATION4from @LOCATION5 with my family when I was just a child. We moved the small town of @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, where we have lived for @NUM1 years. Over the years there have been many difficult times, but we always managed to get through them by laughing together as a family.This past year has been especially trying, and I don't think we would have survived if we hadn't been able to celebrate the tragic time with laughter. My @CAPS2 stayed in @LOCATION5 when we moved to the @LOCATION1 because he was sick and didn't think he could survive the trip. Last year we finally convinced him to @CAPS3 up here with the rest of the family. He moved in with my family and shared my bedroom. It was hard because he snored and made strange noises in his sleep, but I was glad he was with us. When I would wake up tired from lack of sleep, I would just think about the funny noises and laugh.  Then, six months ago, my @CAPS2 was dianosed with a tumor in his brain. There was nothing the doctors could do for him, and they told us he only had a few weeks to live. We were devastated and I couldn't stop crying. We asked @CAPS2 what he wanted to do. He said, ""I want all of you to stop looking like I'm already dead and let's go have some fun!"" That was just like @CAPS2. He said we were going on a trip to @LOCATION2 so he could go to @LOCATION3 before he left this world. I couldn't help laughing at how crazy he could be. Sure enough, when I arrived home from school the next @DATE1, @CAPS2 told us we had ten minutes to grab what we needed and get in the van. He had gone out and rented a @NUM2 passenger van for the trip so everyone in the family could go. We just stared at him. He started laughing and told said, ""@CAPS3 it or you're staying behind!"" I started laughing too, and hurried inside to pack. It was the best trip of my life. @CAPS2 told us all kinds of crazy stories about when he was a boy. Mom wrote some of them down so we could always remember them.  When we got to @LOCATION3 we went on every ride in the park. @CAPS2's favorite was @ORGANIZATION1. He wasn't supposed to ride it because of his condition, but he just laughed and said, ""I""m sure it won't kill me."" @CAPS4 though it made me sad when he said it, I still laughed because he was so happy. Two months after we went home, @CAPS2 died. @CAPS4 though it has been hard and I have cried about it often, I can't help but laugh when I think about that trip and how much fun we had. @CAPS2 taught me that laughter can make all the difference in turning any situation around.",20.0,24.0,,44.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21032,8,"The @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life, she's currently @NUM1 years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships; they embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that's actually how I met one of @CAPS3 good friends.  The incoming @CAPS11 were participating a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS11 through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh if off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 back some of @CAPS3 best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross country team for instance, the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5-@CAPS6, tee shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we've also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3 best memory of it all was when we had our ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS7 or so met up at @LOCATION1's house about a week before districts. The @CAPS10 had to bring snack foods, @CAPS11 had to bring drinks, and @CAPS12 brought the candy, and the @CAPS13 all chipped in for the ""main ingredient"". That first bit of the @CAPS8 was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS9. The ""main ingredient"" to that @CAPS8 was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS9 on a tee-pee raid!  The first event was forking the coaches lawn; but not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS14, so in spite of that a few of the @CAPS7 photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I ever could have @CAPS16 up with something so clever.  After that little stop we were onto the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to tee-pee one of the brother's from the team, but there dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brother's were next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street, one could have called us the worst tee-peers ever. Then all of a sudden three figures came bolting @CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling, ""@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!"". We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn't feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get @CAPS9 to make sure nobody had been hit. ""@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!"", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No,and fortunately we weren't killed that @CAPS8! In relief we discovered that it was only @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantaneously, the whole group burst @CAPS9 in laughter and I had been laughing so hard that I began to cry. I've ever laughed so much or so hard in @CAPS3 life and I'll ever forget it.  Laughter @MONTH1 not have brought just two people together, but nearly twenty. When districts came and passed, I know everyone was sad to see the season @CAPS16 to a close. It was the @CAPS13 last season and nobody wanted to see them leave; but all the great times we had will never be lost, and bonds are @CAPS2.

21033,8,"                            Whats Laughter!How many friends do you really have? What relationships do you have with others? Well, I'm in high school and I usually don't have that many friends. But I have a few and one of my friends @CAPS4 friends with someone that I truly love. (@CAPS1 didn't know that) @CAPS2 year I was a freshmen and i went to the church with some of my friends and their was an @NUM1 grader that fell in the pond/water and I wasn't sure @CAPS20 @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 or not so I end up coming up to him and asked.Me; @CAPS4 you @CAPS3?, do you need some help?@CAPS1 said; @CAPS6, its @CAPS3 I just sprained my ankle.Me; @CAPS3, see you later then.Him. Later thanks for asking though.me; @CAPS9 sure, @CAPS6 problem! The next year when I'm a sophomore I didn't realized that @CAPS1 was going to be their as a freshmen! his name is @CAPS11 I was starting to hang out with him more because @CAPS1 was really funny and sweet.  We went to the @CAPS12 ball together and our other friends were their but i was worried about of some stuffs but @CAPS1 made it butter because at that time i was afraid that my ex was their. @CAPS11 was their to help me and I also didn't know how to dance and their was a song that was on and I didn't realized that i was dancing until @CAPS1 told me that I was so after was dancing with him I end up asking him @CAPS20 I can dance with one of our friends and @CAPS1 said a was able too so me and @PERSON1 ends up dancing and @CAPS1 was their when I needed him. We end up heading outside and I called @CAPS13 @CAPS14 to be picked up. So, in the mean time, we were outside waiting for her. We were laughing at some jokes that we @CAPS15 said to each other. Like one was that @CAPS1 @CAPS15 some thing in his @CAPS15 and acted like that it was a wand of some sort to the school building and @CAPS15 asked like that it was changed to a gingerbread house. Just about a week ago I end up sneaking up behind him and scared him so bad that I end up laughing and @CAPS1 was too. Because @CAPS1 usually doesn't get freaked out like that, and @CAPS1 told me that @CAPS1 is going to get me back and I'm starting to freak out from me not knowing what it @MONTH1 be. @CAPS11 is a great help when i need him!  The thing about laughter in life is that you would need eat ether way your upset or not in the mood.The main thing that was funny from my family is that we prank each other; like my sister would step out of the room and her soda is in the room that I'm in she still @CAPS15 about half of soda in the can their was mustard on the table and she hates mustard form the taste of it but my dad was thinking the same thing that I was wanting to do and that was to put a little bit of mustard in her soda. When she came back to the room I was smiling and my dad was looking at me also my @CAPS17. My sister ends up having some of the soda and she was looking at my @CAPS14 and was like;@CAPS16, who put mustard in my soda? My @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS14 and myself was laughing and she hates mustard!, @CAPS20 it was something that I didn't like and that was put in my soda I would've done this too. So, mostly I'm trying to say is that their is some laughter that is funny. not all laughter is not funny. Its butter @CAPS20 you don't prank people that is close to your heart because they @MONTH1 get mad at you. Like my sister, @PERSON2 was mad at me when it wasn't me it was my dad's idea.",12.0,15.0,,27.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

So while we were walking to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flier saying @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 a street that sounded familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see whats up and whats happening.  We followed the directions to a street that we knew pretty good, till we started hearing music bumping from a distance, so we walked -+ of a mile and saw a good friend of mine and he told me he's going to go pick up lights for a @ORGANIZATION1 and I asked him who's all there and he told me that I need to see for my self.

21035,8," My @CAPS1, my friend, and myself were driving down the road on our way to pick up a mutual friend for youth group that night. Our conversation was anything but special. We were mainly just telling stories of fun times that we had already had with our old friend, and looking forward to making some new ones together. She was such an amazing person. Always ready to crack a joke, make new friends, and have a good time. Her smile was cute, and she was bale to talk someone into doing anything.  As we pulled up to her house, we were thrilled to be able to see her again. It had been weeks since the last ""play date"", and we couldn't wait to be able to catch up with her. She walked out her front door and trotted to our car. The smile on her face was enough to tell us that the feeling, of being reunited, was mutual. Getting out of the car we received bear hugs from her. Times of fun we had had together were flashing in my minds eye, and I was hoping that there would be many more that I would be able to look back on one day. We all got in the car, pulled out of her neighborhood, and started down the road. I realized that we were going the wrong way. ""@CAPS1, we have to go back the other way, don't we?"" I asked. ""@CAPS2, but the barrier in the middle of the road won't let me make a @CAPS3 turn until up the street a little ways.""she said. ""@CAPS4, is that even legal?"" I asked, knowing the answer would be no. ""@CAPS5, I don't really have a choice now do I @CAPS6?"" I could hear the sarcasm in her voice. She could make her voice and appearance sound and look mean, but I knew that in reality, she was just messing around with me. The barrier dissipated, and she was getting ready to make the @CAPS3 turn. Cranking the wheel she was barely able to clear the end of the barrier, but was to late to be able to stop in time to clear the curb on the other side. She accidentally backed up onto the curb making those of us in the back seat jump, and sway, from the impact. My friends and I were all laughing, knowing that she was usually very careful, and had good driving skills. ""@CAPS8 everybody,"" she said. Her body language showing that she was having fun, but that she truly was @CAPS8 for giving us a jolt like that. Our reply was pure laughter. ""@CAPS5, I guess that's our fun for the month,"" she said, her eyes sparkling with joy about making us laugh. She was always very quick to make jokes about situations we were put in.  She pulled forward, the back fender scraping the curb again as we drove off it. Driving away, my friends and I were still laughing , replaying what had just happened to us in our minds eye. It was one of our fondest memories together. A continual joke that we can just mention, and burst into laughter because of it. ""@CAPS10 for the ride @PERSON1,"" my friends said as we got out of the car. We walked into youth group, laughing, knowing that this would be one of the many memories that we would cherish forever.

21036,8," My best friend @CAPS1 and I have known each other since we were two years old. We've helped each other through good times and bad, and are there for each other like chocolate on a bad day. @CAPS1's best quality is the fact that she can make me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. This year @CAPS1 decided to go to @ORGANIZATION4's, an all girls @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, instead of continuing on to @ORGANIZATION1 like me. The first day of @ORGANIZATION2, I could feel that something was missing. @CAPS1. Without her cackling laugh ringing down the hallways, it felt oddly quiet. It reminded me of a place where we made most of our hilarious memories, and where we were told to ""shush"" a fair amount too. Our little brick @CAPS3 church!  Most @DATE1's, I stood up on the alter with the priest and helped him prepare the bread and such. And most @DATE1's, my best friend @CAPS1 was in the pews. One particular @DATE1 I will never forget, @CAPS1 thought it would be funny to sit in the front row with my family and make faces at me all throughout the mass. See @CAPS1, she has the power to make you laugh just by smiling at you. When she makes faces, I usually and up with tears in my eyes. I was standing up in front of the whole congregation and was using every ounce of self control I had not to bust out laughing. The congregation must have thought I was really being changed by the @CAPS8 because I had the biggest smile on my face.  I'm sure you've been in one of those situations where it feels like it is physically impossible to stop laughing. You have to bite you lip, think about something sad, or try breathing excercises. Every time I glanced in her direction a new wave of giggles washed over me, and every time I glanced in my mom's direction, her evil eye burned brighter. After what felt like eternity, the choir sang the closing hymn and once we left the building, I couldn't stop laughing for at least ten minutes. I had bitten my lip so hard that there were ridges indented on the inside of my mouth. Usually after church, we walk over to the @ORGANIZATION3 for coffee and doughnuts. We catch up on @ORGANIZATION2, and each others lives now that we don't see each other as often. She tells me about her new friends and I tell her about our old ones. I always look forward to hearing the hilariously stupid stories of her days, and I always inform her of the latest and greatest gossip from her hometown. But the thing that we always count on is a good laugh with a good friend.  Laughter keeps @CAPS1 and I close. If laughter really does add years to your life, we are probably going to be the two old ladies that live on the hill with twenty cats, and nobody really knows how old they are because they've been around forever. I can be myself around her and know that she accepts me because if I do something stupid I know she'll laugh and then we'll go play with her cat, @LOCATION2, or make popcorn and watch @ORGANIZATION2 three. My family must be tired of our never-ending inside jokes. When I laugh, it feels like liquid gold is bubbling in my stomach and everything is at peace in the world. It is one of the most comforting feelings in the world. That's what I feel when I'm laughing with my best friend @CAPS1.

21037,8," Shafts of light escape through fogged windows casting a shadowed glare upon the surface of the table. A tremendous sign hovers on a wide oak shelf that borders the entire dining area. @CAPS16 read's ""@CAPS1's"" in great letters buried under decades of dust. My eyes dance among the plethora of mismatched antiques and statues strung throughout the room easily filling every crevice. These objects form a family of outliers, each individually unique belonging @CAPS15 the restaurant. Huge posters of All-@CAPS2 athletes tower among @NUM1-inch flat screens while an acrid scent of molded wood and fermented beer lingers. Numerous bras fall from the ceiling of the bar that sits next @CAPS15 the entrance. The sound of crunching echoes in my ears as waitresses maneuver over fallen peanut shells. That's @CAPS4 sets this place apart from the others. The entire floor is littered with barrels of @TIME1's broken shells and mashed peanuts as @CAPS16 is custom for the customers @CAPS15 throw them on the ground. Of course there's my family; a vivacious group of five squeezing our round frames into a booth that comfortably seats four. We seem @CAPS15 mesh quite nicely with the crowd of miscellaneous objects dressed in our '@DATE1 @CAPS3' attire of skirts and dress suits.  Distracted, I busy myself in the menu browsing for something with a little zest and a lot of calories. A loud smashing noise breaks my attention and I slide the newspaper style menu below my eyes. Across the table sits my grandmother; a petite old lady standing proudly at @NUM2 who devotes her free time in attempting stand up comedy. I study the glass jar of ketchup she's holding and watch her pound the corner on a single peanut. The shell cracks open and @ORGANIZATION1 picks out the nuts sweeping its kernels onto the floor. I giggle @CAPS15 myself surprised at @CAPS4 limits this old lady is willing @CAPS15 go @CAPS15. She proceeds @CAPS15 repeat this process with ten more peanuts until the entire family has stopped in curiosity. Looking up, @LOCATION1 pauses with the jar suspended in her hand. ""@CAPS4? I'm just trying new ways of cracking open the nut."" @LOCATION1 exclaims pausing for a comical response. With no reaction we resume position contemplating our meal choices. Minutes later a hefty waitress reeking of drugstore perfume and @TIME1 nights hangover sets down glasses of water and drags off sluggishly. Raising his glass, @CAPS5 motions us @CAPS15 follow.  ""@CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 calls clinking each of our glasses in turn.  ""@CAPS6! And @CAPS6 @CAPS15 cherry people!"" @LOCATION1 pitches in. ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10!"" I shout automatically. Immediately my parents chuckle because my grandmother has never been funny. @CAPS16's a joke that nobody in the family laughs at @LOCATION1's comments but herself and that's how @CAPS16 remains. Years ago, my brother deemed her jokes the ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10"" because she poses as a comedian but truly isn't. From then on, each time @LOCATION1 would crack a ""joke"" someone was quick @CAPS15 respond with yelling ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10!"" @CAPS15 this day, she has neither improved nor given up daily opportunities @CAPS15 attempt @CAPS15 win over her audience. In quiet defeat @LOCATION1 chuckles @CAPS15 herself and focuses down on the menu. Seconds later she's back in the ring for round two.  ""@CAPS16's noon. So are we having breakfast or lunch? Or should we have..brunch?! I'm dying here just laugh already,"" she pleads. For a moment we all just stare at her. Innocent eyes gaze back; the predator calmly sits awaiting the move of its prey. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, we eye each-other and the ribbon is cut. Tea party giggles erupt into hoarse cries as rolls of thunderous laughter echo through the room. I hand my mother a napkin which she uses @CAPS15 dab jubilant tears. The thick wooden table shutters under the pound of my father's fist slapping the surface in hysteria. I laugh so hard my gut aches and yet I cannot understand why everything is so funny. All the while @ORGANIZATION1 sits in pure delight, tickled by the success of finally earning a sincere response @CAPS15 her notorious off-the-cut ""jokes."" @CAPS16's a wonder we aren't thrown out of the restaurant. Customers in surrounding booths peer over the edge of their bench eying us with distaste. However, this isn't the first and certainly wouldn't be the @TIME1 time my family causes a scene. Plain yet obnoxious jokes is a loosely run comradery in our family that always finds its spot in our books of lasting memoirs. The remainder of the meal was spent in bursts of giggles and we were more than kindly shown out the door once our meal was finished.  Its when you break into hysterics for no monumented reason and can't get through retelling @CAPS16 someone else who doesn't find @CAPS16 nearly as humorous.) @CAPS16's those insignificant moments in life when we're reminded of who we are and the bonds we share.

21038,8," A long time ago, my family @CAPS6 I went to @LOCATION1 to see my great aunt @CAPS6 uncle. They had a log cabin right on the lake, with an @CAPS1 tepee in the back yard. They had a dock with a very big @CAPS6 nice boat. I had went with my @CAPS2, my other aunt @CAPS6 my two half sisters. I forgot why we went, but I think it was just because it was the @DATE2 @CAPS6 my great aunt @CAPS6 uncle were getting older. I was very young, @CAPS7 I only remember bits @CAPS6 pieces of the trip. I remember watching cartoons with my sister on the couch, watching ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" in our bedroom, having my sisters make me watch my first scary movie(I hate scary movies), going to a go cart track @CAPS6 driving for the first time, taking one of the extra little boats @CAPS6 going on the lake with one of my older half sisters, also taking the big boat @CAPS6 riding around the lake with my great uncle, he would turn in circles @CAPS7 that we would jump on the wave to make the ride more fun!  We get around to the @DATE1, @CAPS6 they where selling illegal fireworks all around the state for the event of course, but I remember sitting in the car with my two half sisters,@CAPS6 my @CAPS2 had gotten out of the car to go @CAPS6 get fireworks from a stand on the side of the road. We were all @CAPS7 tired from something, @CAPS7 we all stayed in the car. Outside the little stand where they sold the fireworks was this blow up balloon guy; you know one of those blow up looking things where it has a face on it @CAPS6 it doesn't stop moving @CAPS6 dancing? Anyways my oldest half sister starts saying ""@CAPS5 look there he goes doing the macarana!' I had no idea @CAPS13 she was talking about until she pointed to the blow up guy who was just wiggling @CAPS6 springing to life every second.Then my other half sister joins in @CAPS6 starts saying ""@CAPS6 now he's doing the mash potato!"" @CAPS7 now I'm laughing because it's just @CAPS7 silly @CAPS6 funny, I actually thought he was dancing @CAPS6 doing all these dance moves! Now everyone in the car is laughing @CAPS6 giggling about something @CAPS7 silly @CAPS6 funny, I mean we were throwing out silly dance moves, some not even dances moves, just random objects! ""THE @CAPS8!"" ""THE @CAPS9 @CAPS10!"" ""THE @CAPS11!"" ""THE @CAPS12!"" we could not stop laughing! when my @CAPS2 got in the car she was like ""@CAPS13!? @CAPS13 happened?!"". I tried to explain to her @CAPS13 was @CAPS7 funny but she didn't get it. I guess you just had to be there to be a part of the ridiculous car stop at the side of the road where they sold fireworks to see why it was @CAPS7 funny!",20.0,22.0,,42.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21039,8," Laughter can be a very important thing in everyones life because, its something that can help you in many ways. As far as I remeber laughter has helped me get thru alot of emotional problems that I would have with alot of my ex boyfriends. One day my mom saw me crying because my ex had broken up with me and I got really upset so the only thing my mom said to me was that ""laughter was the best medican""at that point I didn't understand what she was trying to say, but now that im getting older I start to realize what she ment with that is that being bummbed about something like that is just useless, and that I had to live my life to the fullest because I was to young to cry over someone who I jst had a simple crush on and she was totally right about that. But then again its not only for boyfriend and girlfriend thing it's also to keep a healthy friendship with your friends Laughter is a way to show how you feel inside. Even when I dont feel like laughing I still do because thats a way to show people that im a strong and independent girl who knows how to take care of herself and live her life. I also try to make the people around me laugh and just have a good time when we hang out because they create the best memories. I'm accually surprised in how much a simple laugh or smile can make someone feel better and sometimes one person can make another one smile just by simply laughing at the most siplest things.   In the other hand there are people who fake laugh meaning that they just laugh but its not that they are laughin because they think yewr funny they are laughin becasue they think yewr acting dumb. But the truth is that sometimes its hard to see whose the real people from the fake because there are many people who fake laugh just to pretend that they like you when they really dont and i truly think thats dumb because you end up beliving that they are your friends when all they do is laugh behind your back. But i dont let that get to me because those kind of people are the kind that its not even worth to take your time with .When i make the people that i care about smile and just have a good time also makes me happy because it makes me feel like i've made a difference in that certain persons day, i kno i cant change their life but I can always try to make their day a little easier by just making them laugh. My little three month old sister is always laughin, always cracking up for no apperant reason and its kinda funny to watch becasue when she laughs I laugh to, thats kinda what I ment to say when i say that a simple smile or laugh from one person to another can make a difference. i mean shes only three months ans shes always happy and always has a smile on her face for no reason, sometimes without knowing shemakes my day even better when she starts laughing out of the blue which i think its somewhat cute.  My mom sometimes tries to make laugh because she knows that I sometimes have bad days at school and she tries her best to make me laugh because when i laugh it makes me forget about al my problems and everything, but i know that laughin cant always be all good, for excample laughin at other peoples pain is just bad and thats something that isnt funny and people do laugh at other people which can really hurt someone. Meaning in many ways laughin can be good or bad but that also depends in the person who is laughin..",20.0,16.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

21042,8," I personally do believe that laughter is very important in any relationship. Who doesn't enjoy laughter every once in a while? I know i do. My true story is on the relationship of my @NUM1 year old toddler daughter and I. I will tell you why I think laughter is important, how it is important, the part it plays in my relationships, and the benefits I believe it can have for any persons relationships. Everyone needs to smile and just laugh, forget about the things that make you frown, so you can turn it upside down. My relationship with @PERSON1(my @NUM1 year old), has mixed emotions at all times, and is constantly changing. The emotions range from complete happiness and admiration, to anger, frustration, and a whole lot of stressfulness. Of course during all of these different feelings, I always love her with every inch of my heart. But during the midst of feeling so stressed out that I want to scream, she will say the funniest thing, or make the most adorable face. And you cant help but smile and laugh, which, let me tell you, makes all the difficulties go away for that brief moment. The most cold, angry, and hurtful people in the world, never laugh. They isolate themselves and don't have good relationships with other people. We all need some laughter in order to not be depressed and sad. If you are always frowning and stressing out, there wont be any room to look at the good things and just laugh. When @PERSON1 does her little thing and it makes me laugh, then she laughs and we are all in better moods. She knows that mommy still loves her, and she knows just the right ways to make me smile and i just wanna pick her up and squeeze her. Because at the end of the day, when you think about all the things that went on in your day, good or bad, there really isn't anything you can do but laugh.And that makes your whole day worth it. It doesn't have to be your children that make you laugh, it can be any relationship with anyone. Maybe its your relationship you have with your boyfriend, and you have been together for a long time, you guys laugh right? because honestly, how could you stand being with a person all the time, and saying you love them and what not, yet you never laugh with them? They never make you laugh? that just wouldn't add up..No relationship can really be a good one, unless there is some laughter. Especially if its someone that you love, and are with constantly. The good things in life, need to exceed the bad things. so, the more laughter the better. I know that parenting is super stressful, especially as a teen mom. and when she puts that smile on my face, i forget about my stresses for that moment and it makes everything better. I wanna give an example of when laughter really made a difference in my day, even my whole week. So you know when you have those days where nothing is going right, your arguing with your parents or boyfriend or whoever, and you have just been feeling like crap all day and week. You have not laughed, smiled, or done anything fun, because the past couple of days just seem to be dragging on and on with the same old routines. Then, the weekend rolls around, and i personally find a babysitter, and you go hang out with a friend or two. We all get together and start talking about old memories, both good and bad ones, ones that make you embarrassed, or ones that make you want to cry. But then you get to the story that always makes you bust up laughing, if its told the right way. And your all laughing for hours it seems(but really,its only been @NUM3 minutes ).Finally, your forced to stop laughing because you were laughing so hard you started crying. and your stomach hurts like you did fifty crunches, and it hurts so bad, yet you feel so good.Then we would all just lay there, catching our breathe. The only noise you hear is a little sputter of a laugh coming out of someones mouth every thirty seconds or so.. So, all-in-all, that's how I see laughter, and why I think its important in everyone's lives. When your sad, it will make you happy. And when your stressed out, it makes you forget everything bad, and just think about the good for a second. When you have had the worst week of your life it seems like, and then you finally get to have your weekend with the girls, and you laugh your heart out, you feel like a new person. Laughter is good for the soul, and it exercises some kind of muscle in your stomach too, I think. Doesn't really matter who you are, or what the issue, laughter will make you feel better, and forget the bad things.

21043,8,"                                       @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 wants to travel, and while traveling is fun, it is more exciting to go with people you love, but sometimes you go somewhere with people you @MONTH1 not know very well. Every two years or so, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION1 has an opportunity to go on a trip together. During these trips, the students are able to work with college professors, eat tons of junk food, get away from their parents, and just have a great time together. It's a experience that every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dreams of. At the beginning of my @CAPS3 year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, my choir director announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @LOCATION2. I was ecstatic to be going, but I'm an extremely introverted person and I knew that I didn't really have any friends in the choir. I also can't walk, and was scared I would be left behind in a store because I couldn't open the doors or they would go across a street corner that didn't have a @CAPS5 dip down into the street, and thousands of other things that were racing through my mind. I was so terrified that that I would be separated from @PERSON3, my one friend who was in choir, that I almost didn't go. I'm not really sure how, but my mother convinced me that everything would be alright, and I had nothing to fear. Once we arrived in @LOCATION2, we split up into groups to see who wanted to go to explore the @PERSON7 and who wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION2 street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare came true, I was separated from @LOCATION3. I tried to tell myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but in the back of my mind I just kept coming to the same conclusion: I would be alone with a bunch of strangers in a city I knew nothing about. Somehow, I got on the bus that was slowly taking me away from @LOCATION3. One of the other girls, @PERSON4, came to sit by me, and attempted to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus rides of my life. When we arrived at the bottom of @ORGANIZATION2 street we split yet again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill and the other was going to ride in one of the old trolleys up to the top then walk down where the hill wasn't as steep. I was forced to go on the trolley because the hill was so steep part of the sidewalk contained steps, and since I can't walk, the only alternative was the trolly. Several of the other kids went with us and once again @PERSON4 was in my group. A couple hours later, after getting lost and turning on several wrong streets, we found the trolley station and bought our tickets. Luckily, I managed to avoid conversing with @PERSON4 this whole time, so the ride up the hill was enjoyable. Some of the local people smiled at us because we were so excited to be riding on the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION1 on our ride.  There were six people in our group at the time, two chaperons and four kids. Once we reached the top of the hill, two of the kids, @PERSON6 and @PERSON5, decided they really had to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperons, @PERSON6, and @PERSON5 raced back down the hill to find a public restroom. This left me, alone, with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, who was the remaining chaperon. We walked leasiurly down the hill, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 doing most of the talking. Every so often they would ask me a question and I would answer in as few words as possible, and that's what was going on when we walked past a group of men, arguing, in front of a store and one of them yelled, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS7's house?"" We didn't really know who he was talking to, or what he was talking about, so we just kept walking, but as we reached the end of the block @PERSON4 and I simultaneously broke into laughter. The man was talking about me. The rest of the way down the hill we started coming up with different weird responses that I should have said to the man, each one being more hilarious than the last one, and as conversations go, we eventually got on different topics, which made me realize that @PERSON4 and I really did have many similar traits. We both loved musicals, we both enjoy reading, and we both have annoying, younger brothers. Ever since that day, @PERSON4 and I have been fairly good friends, all because we took a moment to laughed together.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21044,8," I believe laughter brings many different people together. In my friendships with friends we are always laughing about random, silly, things that happen to us each day. Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. One time when laughter help me out the most was the during fourth grade. Fourth grade had brought so many ups and downs with it which none of us knew it would. My friends and I had the biggest fight over the littlest reason. This fight included my best friend @PERSON2, also my neighbor, @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. We all were very close until this fight which was over my favorite sport, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Everyone had their sides, @PERSON4 sided with @PERSON2 and I was all alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 didn't side with anyone they just wanted us to get along. It was the hardest for @DATE2 and I because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class knew that and could not believe we had a huge fight. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 would try as hard as possible to hang out with both of us but somehow it didn't seem like that to @LOCATION1 and I. We both thought that @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 were never hanging out with us.  Soon enough our teacher and student teacher had called our parents to tell them about this fight. I remember every other day someone would go home crying. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and principal to discuss how they can help us. They concluded with the fact that @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I would being going to see a councilor. @PERSON3 on the other hand got out of seeing the councilor. We found this out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @PERSON1 remembers it ""That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON2 actually talked!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON2 or I remember talking but I guess change had start to come. When we went to the councler she was very nice and talked to us in a way we all felt comfortable. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship and all three of us answered laughing. We said that we laughed every day and now we go home crying. She asked us if we liked to play games during the times we used to spend together, we answered yes. She let us play games, such as monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the day the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we were actually getting along. After school I went home and my mom asked me how the councling session had gone. I smiled and said we all had a blast! The next day the three of us went back to the councler and played more games. This session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we were done writing, all of us read the paper to one another. All having the same message: I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughing, and I will laugh about this fight in the future.  To most extent this message was very true. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of our friends reactions are shocking because they cant believe we had a fight or they just laugh at how stupid the fight was. Most of our friends ask what the moral of the story was and we simply say ""don't let any little thing get in the way of your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times."" In most ways laughing about this silly fight has brought all of us closer and kept us together. Now we have more and more things we can laugh about.  Every friendship has its ups and downs and along with those comes laughter or crying. In the end the only way that you and your friends can be closer is to laugh. Never miss a moment or second guess a change with your friends. They are always going to be with you along the journey of life and laughter is the key.",20.0,18.0,36.0,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4,4,,":**

21045,8,"Benefits of laughter Laughter has always been a big part of my life. when you laugh you are having fun. Having fun puts you in a good mood. When my friends and I get into arguments, or disagreements laughter can be our mediator. Laughter can make a bad situation slightly bearable. Laughter even has great health benefits like working out your core, and lungs. One of my best friend's mom recently passed away right before @CAPS1. Her name was @CAPS2. She was like a second mother to me for several reasons. I had known her for @NUM1 years, and for a small amount of time i even lived at her house. She was basically a mother figure to me, because i don't live with my birth mother. I use to see her almost everyday, because of my friend @PERSON1. He is @NUM2 and we hang out just about every day. I remember the morning he called me and told me his mom was dead on the floor in her bedroom. I ran over there as fast as i could when i saw the ambulance lights. My other friend @PERSON2 spent the @TIME1 at @PERSON1 house the @TIME1 his mom died. When i made it to @PERSON1's house he instantly started to cry on my shoulder. It was wise not to try and make @PERSON1 happy with laughter, because nothing is really funny when a loved one passes away. As time went on @PERSON2 and I started to think of ways to cheer up @LOCATION1. We wanted to get his mind off of his mother. Wouldn't you know it the best way to do so was laughter. I'm the jokester in my group of friends. So some how i have the ability to make people laugh without thinking. I'm more of a doer not a thinker. Id rather see my friends in a good mood than in a bad mood. If people are in a bad mood there is this bad aura or vibe you can just feel it. Its a very undesirable feeling. Laughter cheers up my friends when they are feeling down. Laughter helped make a bad situation like my friends mom dying into a slightly more comfortable situation. Laughter along with trust, and respect are @CAPS3 bring my friends and I together.",18.0,19.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

21049,8,"                                 @CAPS2 @CAPS1      The first time i ever heard about the sport @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was the beginning of my freshman year. I was interested in doing it but i wasn't really sure about it. Though during eighth grade i had played volleyball just for the fun of it and really enjoyed it. I had decided i wanted to play volleyball once i got into high school. But when i got into high school my opinion of still playing on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was much more then i expected, the people, and the attitudes i realized that if i were to play on the high school volleyball team i wouldn't have any fun. So i started to look into joining the @CAPS2 @CAPS1 team. I had finally decided to sign up and join the team. I had really hope i would like @CAPS2 @CAPS1 because it was my first year on the team and i had absolutely no idea what to expect of it.          The first day of practice, after school i went into the girls locker room, changed and took everything with me and went out to the track shed. When i got out there, i saw a lot of people i had never seen before, except for the kids in my grade and also my best friend. My coach @PERSON1 started to talk to everyone that was new to @CAPS2 @CAPS1. She told us that it would be a great experience and it was a a great sport and also it was more of a individual sport rather than a team sport. But also we did many things as a team. After she had talked and discussed the basics of @CAPS2 @CAPS1. We we're to jog our warm up lap and then stretch as a team. Then we were to start our run for the day and everyday was a different work out either a road run or a track work out. I began to really enjoy @CAPS2 @CAPS1. At first, i was beyond sore and couldn't move at all. But as the season started to really get going i eventually got into shape and looked forward to practice after school every day. We trained and got ready for my first race which made me very nervous i had no idea what to expect my first race ever and i was so scared and nervous. But after, i had ran my first race ever i felt good and was proud of myself. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is something i have always loved every since my freshman year when i first started to run.      One of my most favorite races we've ever done was called ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" the first time i ever ran in that race was my freshman year, it was like of our third or fourth races of the season. It also happen to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple years. So i was excited for it because i had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that i would love it, the day of the race i was once again nervous like every other race I've been too and still am every since i first joined @CAPS2 @CAPS1. When we arrived at the destination we set up a tent, started to warm up for the each of the races that was going to happen a boys race and a girls race. We also went over the course and that's when i realized what everyone was telling me the mud pits and a huge steep hill and we had to @CAPS2 a river twice. After the race, i had such a great time my team and i laughed and we all enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun, our bus rides as a team, all the fun practices. As a team we enjoyed many laughs and all the fun times we've had together. My favorite year of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 would have to be my freshman year because it was my best season, i loved it. We grew to love each other and bonded as a team. Laughter was a big part of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 we laughed and enjoyed each others company as we practices and also as we were on bus rides on the way to our meets. We had a lot of fun, and laughed often as a team and that to me was a big part of getting to know my team and being able to bond and build relationships and friendships with everybody on my team. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is a big part of running and having fun and enjoying everyone's company, without laughter our team would not be as happy,excited, or even ready to practice. Laughter is big in @CAPS2 @CAPS1 without it our team would not have as much fun as we've had over the years.

21051,8," One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS1 what I see most is laughing. There is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the ""right time."" @CAPS1 one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. Quietly turning over my shoulder I try to hear more of the story. Her friend nodded and comfort her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross it was when he ate. Sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @CAPS1 still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS1 a slow smile washed over her face. The woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @CAPS1 you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. I thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. I feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS1 then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine to any problem.  After watching the two woman I turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. Then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head and they got silent again. The train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. His cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @CAPS1 sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. This was the start of could maybe be even young love. I smiled and rested my head on the window. Watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @CAPS1 I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. Making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.  The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. I sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. As they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. I throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. I snap around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad smiling ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high pitched @CAPS1 muffled in my dads coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. No action was funny or a friend saying something @CAPS1 because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS1 because your happy. And then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. Maybe just for a little awhile @CAPS1 it's still something that could make your whole day better.",27.0,18.0,42.0,42.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4,,,":**

21052,8,"All Of us now how to laugh and all of us probably have laughed at least once in our entire lives. But I never laughed as hard as I did the day my friend @CAPS1 and I were waiting for our friends @LOCATION1, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 to come back from getting @PERSON3 from @LOCATION3 to come down and hang out for a little while. @PERSON1 had to wait at my house for them to get back, on the way to my house I'm thinking what in the world am I supposed to do with @CAPS1 all alone? @PERSON1 and I always have a lot of fun hanging out with each other but we always have people around when we do hang out, I anticipated when @PERSON1 got there cause I couldn't think of what me and @PERSON1 could do when we were at my house with out @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 being there. We couldn't hang out in the house because my @CAPS3 had a cold, so we had to go outside in to the shop which is also called a garage, and hang out together until @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 got @NUM1 finally showed up and I didn't feel as sick as i thought that I would when she got there, she got out of the car and came in, we went straight to the shop and got started on trying to find something to do, @PERSON1 suggested that we sat down and just talked, I was up for anything as long as it was fun and didn't involve going anywhere at @NUM2: @NUM3 @CAPS4 clock at night. I sat there and asked her about her life was she happy, did she hate living in @LOCATION2 and a lot of other stuff. but then the ultimate topic of conversations came up... T.V. commercials. we talked about all of our favorite @CAPS5 commercials and why they were our favorite, I told her my favorite commercials of all time were the freecreditreport.com commercials, the old ones not the new ones, and that the reason i loved them so much was because they had real life situations in them that made them very easy to believe but they were also sort of hard to believe cause i don't know anyone who has had to work at a restaurant dressed as a pirate because of identity theft, or someone who has had to buy a really cruddy car because their credit score was whack, and I've also never heard of a used sub compact? Any-who @CAPS1 said that her favorite commercial was a car commercial that had dancing hamsters in it telling you which car would be the best choice to go with, @CAPS1 was describing the commercial to me and actually started dancing in the middle of my garage. It was quite funny but at the same time some what disturbing. @PERSON1 is a really good friend even if she is a little goofy sometimes but the best thing about having @CAPS1 is knowing that when ever i need a really good friend i have @CAPS1 after the whole dancing bit i knew what i wanted to while @CAPS1 was there... I wanted to be crazy and hyper I wanted to be so full of energy the world fastest runner wouldn't be able to keep up with me! I went into the kitchen and downed some sugar and got about as hyper as @CAPS1, only less, then the time almost flew by before we knew it @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON3 were there we couldn't believe it. @PERSON3 got out of the car and the first person he gave a hug to was @PERSON1 of course, then he gave me a hug, then @PERSON4, then @PERSON2. I hadn't seen @PERSON3 in so long it was like we had never met before. @CAPS1 showed everyone her dance and the song, everybody laughed so hard i thought they were gonna pass out I had a lot of fun that night mostly because of @CAPS1, she was very nice she was funny and she kept me thinking about other things then what was on my mind at the time @CAPS1 was a big ball of hyper that night, I thought that it was funny. We were just standing there in the shed and she goes ""mouse"" and I scream and jump up on to a chair and scream ""@CAPS14!"" @CAPS1 reassures me that it was in the rafters and couldn't come down and get us so for the rest of the time we just acted like he wasn't even there I'm really lucky to have @CAPS1 and I'm really glad for the day i worked up enough courage to go over and say hi to her that day in art cause other wise id be lost @PERSON1 is the best friend a girl could ever ask for and I was fortunate enough to get her for my best friend. She is smart funny and talented and I would miss her if she were gone @CAPS17 really glad she moved down here from port orford.",16.0,16.0,,32.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21053,8,"I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went threw the hardest days of my life a little @DATE1, there was still someone to make me or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that we're just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it come to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was @DATE2 time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I can not explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six @DATE1 old at my best friends house who owned eight lamas, who got to get tied up in the yard everyday. The one I always got to walk was named, @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was sweet, @CAPS2 I though, until one @DATE2 day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting drug across a highway that was usually busy, all I could here was people yelling ""let go of her lead!"" @CAPS2 me being six I thought if I let go that the lama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back and laugh, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much anytime I am with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together but, it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we we're trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, to everyone. If you don't laugh at least once in day then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as @CAPS2 as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend.

21054,8,"Laughter is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2't @CAPS6 frustrating when you can't manage to get someone to laugh? Is @CAPS6 really possible to be so upset that you can't even crack a little smile? There's something to laugh at in every situation, sometimes @CAPS6 just takes some thinking and imagination to figure out what @CAPS6 is. I personally had an experience where laughter was all I could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay. Last @DATE1, I was babysitting, @CAPS6 was a nice and sunny day and we were all craving chocolate frostys from @ORGANIZATION1. At the time I could not legally drive anybody outside of my family, so we decided to call my sister, @LOCATION1. She had the day off work, so @CAPS6 seemed to be a perfect day for frostys. We waited for what seemed like forever for @PERSON2 to get to the house and finally, after about an hour, she pulled in the driveway. The kids were so excited. The four of us loaded into the back of @CAPS4 car and off we went to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there, we started getting out of the car and that's when I noticed something was wrong. @PERSON2 had just locked the keys in the car, with the keys still in the ignition and the car running! I was still getting the kids out of the car so you'd think that I would just reach in and grab them, but no, that was not the case here. I asked @PERSON2 ""@CAPS3 did you leave your car running? Aren't you going to get your keys?"" @CAPS4 response was, ""@CAPS5, no! I locked @CAPS6 too! Don't close your door!"" @CAPS6 was too late. I instinctively closed the door after i was done. I hadn't really thought about the fact that I could have saved all of this from happening, especially considering that I was the one that noticed @CAPS6 first. Apparently I don't listen to people's responses after I ask them a question because the kids were all practically rolling on the ground because they were laughing so hard and I couldn't figure out what was so funny. Then @CAPS6 hit me, I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the @LOCATION2's parking lot with three kids, locked outside of a car that was running and we didn't really know what to do from there. Our first solution to the problem was to call my mom and have @CAPS4 bring the spare @CAPS1, but we weren't really sure where the spare @CAPS1 was at the time. My mom said that she didn't have @CAPS6 so we would have to call my dad and ask him where @CAPS6 was. We called him and first he laughed at us for being so stupid, but then said the @CAPS1 was in his truck and somebody would have to come get @CAPS6 from him because he was about to go into a meeting. Obviously we couldn't go get @CAPS6 from him, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @CAPS6, though at this point she wasn't very happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity. She told us to not worry about the car, nothing was going to happen to @CAPS6 with @CAPS6 locked, and just go inside @PERSON1's and get our frostys. Through all of this @PERSON2 and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained, but they didn't really need us for that. They were too busy role playing me closing the door while @PERSON2 said not to. They thought @CAPS6 was hilarious. @PERSON2 and I were not so humored by @CAPS6, although we did think @CAPS6 was pretty funny to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over again. Instead of us making the kids laugh, they were making us laugh. We sat at @LOCATION2's for almost two hours before my mom showed up with the @CAPS1. @CAPS6 turned out that the @CAPS1 was not in my dad's truck like we thought, @CAPS6 was at our house, hanging on the board with all of the other spare keys. That didn't matter though, all that mattered was that we get the kids back home before their mom showed up with us not there. The car sitting there using up the gas with nobody in the car was not the funny part of the day, neither was @PERSON2 blaming me for everything and making me fill @CAPS4 tank with all the money I had earned that day from babysitting. The funny part was the kids. Still today, they laugh about our little @PERSON1's adventure. @CAPS6 just makes me realize that @CAPS6's all kids that bring laughter to the world and encourage happiness in everyone. I believe everybody needs a little laughter in their day, even if they think @CAPS6's the worst day ever. Laughter really is the @CAPS1.",20.0,23.0,,43.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21055,8," Laughter is a huge part oh building friendships, relationships, and partnerships. Laughing is the first thing you learn to do you are born knowing how to laugh its the only thing that you are born to know how to do. Laughter for me is what starts a friendship if I can make someone laugh we are already closer then when we first said ""@CAPS1"". As an example when I started working at the daycare i am at now when I got the other teachers to laugh you can just tell its there way of excepting you as part of there crew.  On the first day of work I walked in the the daycare nervous they sent me to the preschool classroom. I am pretty sure my boss could tell I was nervous and it made me laugh. It made me feel welcome to be there and like we could be friends. The children in that class room made me laugh the things they did. well working with children you find out if you can make them laugh or if you laugh at there jokes they are more inclined to trust you and with that you can make them feel comfortable around you. Having someones trust is sometimes hard to get but if you get it from the very beginning its easy to keep but also very easy to lose. When someone is down in the dumps making them simply laugh can make everything better laughter is like medicine in makes you feel better when nothing else can. Its safe to say making people laugh comes natural to I am just good at it and jokes come easily. When you laugh it makes everything better. Laughing is actually health and is a form of excursive.  When I am at work and kids laugh it makes me feel better even if I am having the worst day ever. When I am around people that are happy it makes me feel alot better about myself. Its even better when its babies that laugh becasuse they are so cute when they do it.",15.0,20.0,,35.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

21056,8,"Laughter, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on an @CAPS3 @DATE1 @CAPS4  One of my favorite @DATE1 traditions is the visit to the house of our @CAPS2, the @CAPS5. They live on eighty forested and meadowed acres outside of a quaint, old town. Their small green house overlooks brown fields and a blue pond, with tall trees forming a backdrop.  We arrive midmorning. We either find our @CAPS2 in the house or encounter them tromping out of the woods to meet us, shovels, chainsaws and other trailbuilding implements in their hands. After the customary hello, how have you been, we often wander around the yard, exclaiming at the new fruit trees or hearing stories about the latest tenants of the birdhouses.  During the hottest part of the @CAPS4, we head for the shade of the lush @ORGANIZATION1 woods. A short walk will bring us to a trail. I love walking among the sun-streaked ferns and fallen logs, treading carefully the rickety bridges over burbling streams, bouncing confidently on the sturdy new bridges, and trying to avoid the dogs as they galumph in and out of the water. @PERSON2 knows all about the flora and fauna of the region, so we get a constant stream of knowledge as we hike. He also, of course, has to tell us about the trees he's planted -- a redwood here (look how well it's doing! A foot since last fall!) and a douglas fir over there (not as well. That big redwood is shading it too much). One of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead-end section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago. We always walk to the end of it and discuss where it could go from there -- over the stream or beside it, or up the hill and if so, where would the switchbacks be? could you really bike up a trail like that?  After our walk, we arrive back at the house, sweaty and talkative. Then it's time to put on swimsuits and jump in the pond! They recently built a dock that we can jump off of -- a great improvement over wading in from the edge. We swim for the majority of the @TIME1, racing from one end of the pond to the other, splashing on innertubes, having pondweed-throwing battles. Finally we get tired and sit by the side of the pond, drying off in the warm sun.  By @TIME1, dinner is ready. Laura usually makes salmon, accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes. We drag chairs out to the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper. From the hill, we can see turtles and birds on the pond, bugs over the fields, and more birds swooping through the air feasting on the aforementioned bugs. After the meal, we haul chairs and dishes back to the house and sit on the porch into the @TIME2.  @PERSON2's favorite part of the @CAPS4 is at dusk, when the sun is at just the right angle to show all the bugs swirling through the air. At one point, all the bugs gather together and create a tornado, twisting upwards into the darkening sky, and then -- they're gone, until the next @CAPS4. It's an incredible spectacle; thousands of tiny insects disappering at one swoop.  The best thing about these days is the friendship and comradery we have with this wonderful family. The parents knew each other long before us kids were born, so we have a lot to talk about; @PERSON2 is very interested in science topics, and he always finds a way to bring up the latest article he read. And, as with all great @CAPS2, we laugh constantly. I consistently get hiccups at least three times just when we're lounging on the porch after our busy @CAPS4. Even on the most serious topics, my dad or the @PERSON1 boys can find a joke to make, usually ""politically incorrect"" but always very funny.  Now don't even get me started on the @DATE1 camping trips, winter ski trips or autumn cider pressing we do with the @CAPS5.

21057,8,"                                      Misunderstood ""@CAPS1 the heck is her problem,"" is @CAPS1 I thought as I glanced over and @CAPS7 gave me @CAPS15 nasty look. @CAPS27 obviously thought the new girl was weird. @CAPS7 @CAPS24 had @CAPS15 killer look in her eyes. I observed the way @CAPS7 glared at @CAPS27 in the room, and how her facial expression never changed. ""@CAPS2 huh,"" my cousin, @PERSON1, asked while staring at @CAPS3, who was, of course, the new girl. I glanced over at @CAPS3 and then back at @LOCATION1. ""@CAPS5 on! @CAPS11 can say @CAPS26! @CAPS7 can't hear us,"" @CAPS7 whispered. @PERSON1's whispers weren't exactly as quiet as @CAPS7 thought. @CAPS3 could probably hear everything we were saying. I glanced over at her again, and I noticed behind those cold eyes, @CAPS7 seemed kinda lonely and sad. I guess @CAPS26's possible, @CAPS7 has been the talk of the whole @NUM1 grade class since @CAPS7 arrived about @NUM2 days ago. ""@CAPS6 hello! Taylor? Are @CAPS11 there?"" @CAPS7 was now in my face and view of @CAPS3.  ""@CAPS7 does look @CAPS2 on the outside, but maybe @CAPS7 is actually a nice person,"" is @CAPS1 I said, but I knew @CAPS15 would not satisfy @PERSON1 at all. ""@CAPS1? Definitely not. Her parents probably belong to some mafia or something. @CAPS7 gives off that type of aura."" ""@CAPS11 shouldn't judge someone @CAPS31 their looks,"" I responded. @PERSON1 gave me @CAPS15 sort of confusing look. ""I mean, @CAPS11 never know unless @CAPS11 ask.""  ""@CAPS12 if your such the expert on @CAPS26 why don't @CAPS11 go sit with her at lunch, and ask her."" @CAPS13 man. There was @CAPS29 way I could possibly do that. I know I @CAPS24 said not to judge someone @CAPS31 their appearance, but @CAPS7 looks like if I even open my mouth to speak to her @CAPS7 will kick me in the shins. @CAPS1 a predicament @CAPS15 is. ""@CAPS14't @CAPS11 the one who wants to get to know her? @CAPS11 ask."" @CAPS15 one won't @CAPS31 past @PERSON1 either. ""@CAPS16? @CAPS29 way. We already decided @CAPS11 were going to ask. @CAPS11 can't @CAPS5 back with the same thing,"" @CAPS7 argued. @PERSON1 is a very stubborn girl, and though @CAPS7 likes to pick on me, @CAPS7 really is a nice person. Also, despite her obnoxious exterior @CAPS7 has a lot of friends, unlike myself who is shy.  ""@CAPS17,"" I muttered. I had to give in. @CAPS29 matter @CAPS1 I say, I am going to have to face @CAPS3.  ""That's @CAPS1 I thought. @CAPS26's a good opportunity to make a new friend. I am @CAPS24 helping @CAPS11 out."" @CAPS7 had @CAPS15 mischievous grin on her face. I glanced over at @CAPS3 one last time, and then at the clock. @CAPS26 was @NUM3 in the morning, give or take a minute or two since I am nearsighted, but lunch is at @NUM4.  I couldn't pay attention at all during class. I was too busy playing out possible scenes that might occur at lunch. Maybe @CAPS7 isn't mean, maybe @CAPS7 is actually nice, and people are @CAPS24 misunderstanding, including me. That aside, I don't even know @CAPS1 to say; I can't @CAPS24 casually walk up, sit down in front her, look her in the eye, smile and say ""@CAPS21. How are @CAPS11?"" The impossible is @CAPS24 impossible and people should @CAPS24 except @CAPS26, in fact @CAPS26 should actually be a fundamental law. I looked over at the clock again, @CAPS26 was now @NUM5 and still ticking. ""@NUM6 minutes,"" @PERSON1 said in some type of singing tone. I sighed. ""@CAPS22? I kept watching @CAPS11 during class. Looked like @CAPS11 were going to jump through that window and run away at any second."" @CAPS7 laughed. My seat was @CAPS31 the window, and that option had not slipped my mind. ""I have @CAPS29 clue @CAPS1 I am going to say,"" I finally said.  ""@CAPS24 say anything that won't offend her. Ask about her hobbies or @CAPS1 @CAPS7 likes. Talk about school even,"" @CAPS7 replied. ""@CAPS26's time. Go."" @CAPS27 piled out of the class room and in to the cafeteria. After I got my lunch, I started walking toward the table @CAPS3 was at; @CAPS29 one was around her, @CAPS29 surprise there.  ""@CAPS6, @MONTH1 I sit here,"" I asked. My voice was kinda shaky and I thought I was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at @CAPS1 @CAPS7 said. ""@CAPS31 all means, go ahead,"" @CAPS7 smiled. Wow, @CAPS7 is really cute when @CAPS7 smiles. I smiled back and sat down. I created a conversation @CAPS31 introducing myself and asking how @CAPS7 was and how @CAPS7 liked @CAPS15 school. To my surprise we actually shared a common interest, and bonded. @CAPS7 was laughing. I was laughing. We were laughing together.  After that day, and even still today we are the best of friends. That slight feeling of laughter is @CAPS24 so nostalgic, @CAPS26's almost indescribable. @CAPS24 something so minor such as laughter, or even a little giggle, can bring anybody together to form a simple bond, friendship. Laughter is truly an essential part of life.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

21058,8," It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a @CAPS9 time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To @CAPS15 laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know @CAPS22 to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy @DATE1 day in @DATE2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON3!"" We heard @PERSON2 scream as @PERSON1 and I walked into my room. ""@CAPS1 boy."" I thought, ""@CAPS3 we @CAPS7 again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them @CAPS3 at the same time."" @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through @CAPS28 head.  ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 happened this time?"" @PERSON1 sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, @CAPS29 did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends @CAPS7 at each other the way @CAPS29 were. ""@CAPS4!"" I finally yell. ""@CAPS3's @CAPS22 we're going to do. You,"" I pointed to @PERSON3, ""@CAPS7 and sit over there."" @PERSON3 walked out of my room and sat down. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS9. @CAPS14 can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?"" I looked at each of them, @CAPS29 nodded in response. ""@CAPS9, @CAPS14 lets @CAPS7 finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game."" I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON3 walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. ""@CAPS10't @CAPS11 @CAPS12 just a comical genius?"" @PERSON2 said starring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS28 because @CAPS28 eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 said laughing. ""@CAPS14 who's calling who crazy?"" @CAPS15 and @PERSON1 both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. @PERSON2 had on @CAPS28 game face for that comment.  I leaned over to @PERSON1 and whispered, ""@CAPS1 this is not going to be pretty."" We started preparing for the worst. ""@CAPS17 grab @PERSON3's arm and drag @CAPS28 if you have to, out of this room."" @PERSON1 jumped to @CAPS28 feet and got @PERSON3 out of the room, with just enough time for @CAPS15 to pin @LOCATION1 to my bed. When @CAPS29 had left and the door was closed I let @CAPS28 up but kept myself between @CAPS28 and the door. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 is going on with you two?"" I nervously asked @CAPS28.  @PERSON2 started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see @CAPS22 @PERSON3 had to say, since I never actually got anything out of @LOCATION1. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS22's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before."" @CAPS20 started flowing down @CAPS28 cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill.  ""I...I don't know @CAPS22 h..happened."" @PERSON3 said still weeping. ""I j..just wanted to a..ask @CAPS28 @CAPS22 ha..happened today."" @CAPS21 and @PERSON1's faces just had that looked of, @CAPS22 happened that we missed.  ""@CAPS22 did you mean when you said @CAPS22 happened today?"" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave @CAPS15 @CAPS28 response. ""@CAPS23 that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?"" @PERSON3 looked at @CAPS15 and simply said yes. ""@CAPS4 come in @CAPS3."" All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 was in the middle protecting @PERSON3. ""@CAPS4, this is pointless. @CAPS23 you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! @CAPS29 just make things more complicated anyway."" I looked to both of them, @CAPS20 streaming down both their rosie cheeks. ""@CAPS14 can we just forgive and forget?"" @CAPS27 filled the room. @PERSON3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. ""I'm @CAPS23 sorry, @PERSON2. Can you forgive @CAPS15?"" @CAPS28 face tear stained and red eyed, @PERSON2 was @CAPS17 to reply. ""Of course I forgive you."" @CAPS29 hugged with @CAPS20 still streaming down their faces.

21059,8," Laughter is one of the most important elements in one's life. If you're down, one smile, or laugh, causes your body to send messages throughout you body making you feel better. Scientists also say that it takes more muscles to frown than smile. I believe that this is true, because in order to frown, you have to make your whole body look like it's frowning, like your shoulders and your face, but only a little smile shows people that you're happy. In that way, my family is extremely beneficial to each other. Everyday when we're having a conversation, someone will bring up a story, or movie quote that they were reminded of and say it out loud to everybody with just the right accent so that it sounds exactly like the movie, and cause everyone to laugh. For example, every now and again, my brother or sister will bring up a quote from @PERSON1 or @PERSON2, two comedians we really enjoy listening to, and every person in the room would pitch in with hilarious quotes they said and this could go on all night. Or, a little while ago, my favorite movie wasGet @CAPS1 because it was quite entertaining, so we would have rampages over supper or just randomly in the kitchen quoting that one movie for at least half an hour and the room would be filled with non-stop laughter. On the other hand, someone will make a random comment because they heard wrong, or just don't understand. Like when we were having a dinner party at my house. My family and our guests were sitting at the table just finished eating when we got onto the topic of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because my little sister was learning about them in school. We verbally completed the train of ""Which @CAPS4 ruled @CAPS5, who they came from, and @CAPS5 they're other names were"". But according to my little sister, we missed one. So, out of the blue comes ""@CAPS5 about @CAPS6?!"". Her intentions were about the @CAPS4, but I believe everyone in the room heard ""@CAPS5 about @CAPS9 @CAPS10?!"", until we paused for a second and processed @CAPS5 she meant, and we all laughed and she had no idea why until she stopped to think about it herself. Our family has good times filled with laughter and jokes, but there are also a few very depressing times. About four years ago, an incident happened with my next door neighbor that caused him to be brutally attacked and pass away on our door step. He was very dear to my family and the rest of the cul-de-sac we live in, and for him to die like that was extremely unexpected and terrible to wake up to in the middle of night. After that, there was a period of not very much laughter and fun because we were all haunted by this horror. But, we all knew that his spirit was there to protect us, and so whenever we thought of that, there was a gap between the mourning of his loss, only to be filled in with happiness and laughter. I believe that my family and I have a really tight connection between each other, because we're so funny. There's never any stress between us, but always a calm sense of familiarity and bonding. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe that, whoever that person is, is right. Even between two strangers that run into each other on the street, if they stop and have a conversation, and one person cracks a joke causing them both to laugh, it's the spark to an immediate connection, and they could become friends for a long time. This is one of the most important values that people have, and most people overlook how much it really matters to humanity.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

21060,8," The human brain is a piece of work. Its the kingdom to our lives. It infuriates us, guides us, helps us and destroys us. Our brains can make our bodies feel anything it wants to. Its really something else. One of the most valuable things are brains are capable of is a sense of humor. Laughter. The ability to not take life to seriously for a moment. That light switch in @CAPS7 body that causes @CAPS7 brain to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness. Laughter is our brains only way of coping with the world. Scoping out the comical events life has to offer us. I am personally one of those people that finds everything in life funny, or will find a way to make it funny. I am hardly ever serious nor take things seriously. The same with my friends, we are always the people having a good time because we make life interesting. Maybe its our gnarly facial expressions we exchange one another, or we @MONTH1 just be funny looking. Either way we have a sense of humor. That's @CAPS4 life is about, @CAPS1 @CAPS7 happiness with people who fill @CAPS7 life with joy. @PERSON1 said, ""live simply, so that others can simply live."" I @CAPS9 we all can with a little sense of humor. Last year a couple friends and I went to mission ridge for a weekend to go snowboarding. We had it made, our own hotel suite with two king sized beds and a plasma @CAPS2. @PERSON2 and I slept on one bed and @PERSON3 on the other. We all have always gotten along perfectly and have shared the biggest laughs together. Nothing could come between any of us. Other than a little midnight prank. On the second night at the hotel, @PERSON3 fell asleep first. @PERSON2 and I were watching some ghost movie that bored us to tears. @PERSON2 was eating a bag of pop corn and started throwing little kettle pieces at @LOCATION1, trying to wake him up. ""@CAPS3, I have the funniest idea."" @PERSON2 whispered over to me. ""@CAPS4?"" I mouthed back lazily. Without a word @PERSON2 jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. She returned with a tube of @ORGANIZATION2 tooth paste, a sack of coins and a package of peach rings. ""I had nothing to do with this."" I stated, continuing to glare at the television set. @PERSON2 began squirting out tooth paste onto @PERSON3's arms, she ran the creamy solution down his legs, back up to his face and into his hair. She stuck quarters, dimes, and penny's into the minty cement, along with the sugary peach rings. ""@CAPS5 is going to kill you."" I gasped. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 wont! It will be hilarious."" @PERSON2 blurted and then plopped back onto the hotel bed, admiring her work. @PERSON2 then picked up her bag of popcorn and resumed throwing pieces of kettle at @LOCATION1's face. The next morning was not how @PERSON2 planned. @PERSON3 woke up alright, but did not have the expression on his face @PERSON2 intended on. ""@CAPS7 done for @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 hollered. @PERSON2 smiled, still convinced this was all a joke. I saw the fury in @LOCATION1's eyes. @CAPS5 was beyond irate. His body crusted over with dried tooth paste. Quarters, dimes and penny's drilled into his skin and peach rings dangled moldy off his legs. @PERSON3 rushed into the bathroom to look into the mirror. @CAPS5 stormed back into the room with a shampoo bottle clenched in his hand. @PERSON2 turned to face him and her smile disintegrated. ""@CAPS4 are you gonna do with that shampoo bottle?"" @PERSON2 questioned, confused. @PERSON3 grew closer to @PERSON2, she backed away slowly, not quite sure @CAPS4 his intentions were. They both switched positions, her back now facing the door and @PERSON3 across the room by the window. @PERSON3 raised the shampoo bottle over his head. ""@CAPS9 fast."" @PERSON3 shouted and chucked the bottle as hard as @CAPS5 could at @ORGANIZATION1's face. But sadly, @PERSON2 ducked just in time for the bottle to miss her face and create a nuclear explosion on the door behind her. Blue liquid spewed out all over the walls. There was an indent of where the bottle hit the door. @PERSON2's whole back side was covered in blue sludge. I hopped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place. @PERSON3 reached @PERSON2 and immediately burst into roaring laughter. @PERSON2 sat down in a puddle of shampoo and ruptured in chuckles. I stood there, smiling at them. @PERSON3 still crusted over, @PERSON2 covered in blue goop that looked like someone threw up a blueberry smoothie on her back. I sat down with them, we all starred at each other without a word. everything was fine. It then occurred to me that @CAPS6 matter @CAPS4 we do to each other, enrage or try to explode one another, we will always find a way to laugh about it. A sense of humor is merely our souls telling us everything will be okay. Its that one value in life we can cherish forever.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

21061,8," It was my thirteenth birthday. I woke up on a sunny day which was odd for @ORGANIZATION1 because it was late @DATE1. I got up with excitement. I ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked me if I wanted to go to work with him and i said yes. My dad is a roofer so i couldn't go on top of the houses because i was to young. I had to stay on the bottom and pick up trash that they would throw. I was doing that for a while, then i got my soccer ball out of my dads truck and i started running around kicking the ball. As i was running i noticed this slippery spot. I had in mind not to go there but i forgot and i stepped on the slippery spot. i fell but while i was falling some how i kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and it came back to hit me in the face. My dad and uncles were laughing their lungs out while i was turning red and embarrassed. They were telling me how funny it would be if it was slow motion.i was so embarrassed i put the ball back in my dads truck and i went back to work. The sun was coming down, and we were heading home. we arrived at my house and i walk towards the house door and i opened it and i hear ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2, i looked around and my friends and family were there. the reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a @CAPS1 party.i go and say hi to my family and friends. Then i went to go take a shower, iwas in the shower putting soap when all of a sudden the lights go out. I got scared and screamedas loud as i could. I ran out of the bathroom. Went to the the living room and the lights turn back on. My family and friends looked at me and started to laugh. In my head im thinking why are they laughing at me? I looked down and im naked. Everybody was laughing and enjoying the moment, while i was turning pitch red and about to cry. I ran to my room, i put some clothes on.

21063,8," What would you do in a world with @CAPS4 laughter? Everyday everyone smiles or laughs. It makes a person feel better. Laughing is a healthy drug it affects you and other people for the best. There are many times in my life where all I needed was to laugh. All I wanted was to have someone there to make me smile and bring up my spirits. I have an example. I just moved again it was my @NUM1 high school. I felt totally alone I knew nobody, and nobody was there to help me feel less alone. I wanted a friendly face to smile at me, or talk to me. The whole @NUM2 hours at this new school was dreadful. When waiting for my mom to come get me I was hating my new life here. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 one talked to me on the first day, then @CAPS4 one will talk to me at all"" is what kept passing through my mind. I remembered everyday after school walking home with my group of friends, we would all tease each other, or just say something stupid. We were always laughing and happy. As I was sitting there waiting for my mom, I heard my name being called by a familiar voice. As I looked up I found my friends @PERSON5, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 sticking their heads out my moms car window waving at me. Seeing how school just barely got out there were tons of teenagers still @NUM3, @PERSON2, @PERSON6!!"" I exclaimed. My unhappy thoughts disappeared and I was smiling. I could feel people starring at me as my friends got out of the car to give me a hug. For some reason I didn't care all I cared about was being able to smile again, and be truly happy with my closest friends. I grabbed my purse and ran over to them to give them all hugs. They missed two classes to come pick me up from school. My mom told them how unhappy I was, and that what I needed was a friendly face. She couldn't have been more right. After hugs, smiles, and laughs were exchanged my friend @PERSON5 said his classic line.""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @PERSON3?"" @CAPS4 one could help but laugh even my mom broke a smile. When getting in the car I forgot all about my bad day and how horrible I felt. I forgot about how badly I wanted my friends there to make me feel me. When they actually came I couldn't have been more happier. My life felt great, school after that was great. I made great friends there because my three buddies reminded me who I was, and pushed me to be me. They made me laugh and when I smiled at my new high school people were more open and welcoming to me. It wasn't long after that I @PERSON4 was able to go to school with a smile and laugh everyday. Friends have a great influence in your life they remind you to smile and how great a laugh is. Laughing is the truth between happiness I would have to say. It was because of me smiling and laughing that I made new friends and had another great high school life. Laughing brought people to me because it made me seem like a friendly fun person that I am. I see laughing being the cure to all unhappiness.",20.0,17.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,3,,":**

21064,8,"@PERSON1 of laughter     Once upon a time there once lived a girl named @PERSON1. The year was two thousand and fourty eight and there were only a few people that were alive after @DATE1, thats @CAPS7 the world ended. @PERSON1's friend @PERSON2 was a huge @CAPS1 freak. She would, by herself, make funny vidoes and put them on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. One day she was so bored that she went and sat in front of her computer camera and made an I'm a @ORGANIZATION1"" video. It was the funniest thing @PERSON1 had ever seen. She was wearing a a @ORGANIZATION1 hat that was part of the @CAPS1 uniform, and was wearing a @CAPS1 shirt with some of the known characters. @PERSON2 was singing, ""I'm a @ORGANIZATION1. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you."" @CAPS7 she was finished she posted it on the web site. @PERSON1 showed all her friends what an epic faliure that video was, @PERSON2 of course loved it and so did @PERSON1.      Once the video wasnt that cool or funny anymore, which that took about two point five days, no one really watched it and no one really laughed about it, which it was made for that purpose. But @CAPS7 someone would watch it for the first time they would go to school, laugh their butts off and feel like an idiot because everybody had already watched it, and they didnt think it was funny anymore. So from then on people called this kid all sorts of names, but the one that really stuck was @ORGANIZATION1. Eeveryone in @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2's friend group all laughed and @CAPS7 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 didnt laugh, their friends would call them losers because they weren't laughing at the kid who was getting teased. Laughing @CAPS7 someone is being teased isn't funny. The reason why people laugh and put down others is because they are insecure about themselves and it's not a laughing matter.       @CAPS7 people watch the video of @PERSON2 saying she was a @ORGANIZATION1, that was made to make people laugh and to think was funny, @CAPS8 didn't make the rude words people say to be used to put others down.      Laughing is a key thing to a conversation but also it's healthy for people to laugh. @CAPS7 others see that people are getting made fun of, it's not a time to laugh at them, it @MONTH1 be funny in some case but, put yourself in that persons shoes, feel what they are feeling @CAPS7 people say rude and hurtful things, people could stop the people who are throwing out put downs and stand for the ones who are getting their feelings hurt. Laughing was made for things that are actually funny. Say you walk down the street, on a sidewalk, and you walk by these punk kids who think they are the bown diggity, and they are poking sticks and throwing bottles and trash on at a homeless man with his dog, while the man is on the ground in pain from thses kids kicking him to where he cant move, are you just going to walk by and laugh because you think it's funny? No @CAPS2 not, @CAPS2 going to walk, or run, over to the poor man and see if he is oaky, then you maight call the police and see if they can find the kids who did this to this poor old man. See laughing at people who are down because of words or getting beat up isn't right and peeple need to stop, this is a world that if you are the last few people on the planet, and they have known about you laughing at others pain, do you really think that they are going to help you, or just walk by and laugh like you have? People are cruel in this world and we all need someone that is going to help us if we are hurt or down because of hurtful words.      One way you benefit from laughter, you feel good and you have people that will help you in the time of need, if you laugh about the right things. Tell @CAPS2 friends that if they laugh at peoples pain and anger, that one of these days no one is going to be there to stand up for them. You could be the change we have in schools, in work envirnment, in life in genral, be the change for @CAPS2 kids and grandkids, for @CAPS2 future friends, for the future world.""",20.0,18.0,,38.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21065,8," When we look back on the past, everything seems to have had a deeper meaning. When we grow older, however, we see the world with new eyes. We see the truth, harsh, stripped of the glossy film that hid it. Laughter helps us see the joy once again, to remember it is there. When is the last time you got lost in laughter? Studies have shown that laughter releases feel-good chemicals in the body. It can add years to a life because, believe it or not, our bodies like to be happy. Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is that it is free, legal and healthy! Laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together. Through whatever is happening in our lives, laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from the pain and stress. As life gets more and more complicated as we grow older, we find that laughter is harder to come by, but no less needed. I remember a time when I was excited every day to go to school. I loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter. We would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future. Life was simpler, the worst of our worries surrounded the desperation to be older, to shed our youth and step out of the powerless shells we were imprisoned in. Of only we knew what that really meant. Smiles were not hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity that our lives had to offer. Through all the memories and laughter, I began to realize that love existed aside from movies and family, the love that you find for a friend that you treasure. Laughter was the key variable, revealed in understanding my relationships. When you learn how to fall deeply in love as a kid, that patience and trust can get you through ever day of the rest of your life. All we need to do is to is remember not to forget. The simplicity of childhood is what makes it so precious. Unfortunately as we all grown older, the future looms over our heads, casting a shadow over the things we cherish. There is a predetermined way we are supposed to live our lives that for some reason, erases the plausibility of our true aspirations. Laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows. Everything in adulthood orbits around the office and is held to a nine to five obligation. Businessmen walk past looking like identical mindless penguins. Where did all the fun go? It seems that the pleasure is evaporated with every passing day. We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares. Instead we are confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair. All the stress makes us forget to laugh, but we simply can't forget. Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams.  So when is the last time you got lost in laughter? Make it now. Take the pen and turn it into a quill. Step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy. Laugh every day because life is too short to forget.",25.0,22.0,,47.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

21067,8," It all started with a book @DATE1 @DATE1 ago. My mom had noticed I was struggling to find friends, so she took it upon herself to help me make some. She had a few friends from school who had kids of their own, some my age. I had been around these girls a few times as a child, but not recently. I'm not sure today what my mom saw in @LOCATION1 that made her think we would click, but she was right. What seemed like such a small action would change my life drastically. In @DATE2, in my new house I first met @PERSON1. That evening before she arrived I couldn't help but be very upset at my mom for doing this. I felt I was fine and fully capable of making friends myself. She acted like she knew me, but the few acquaintances I had she didn't believe would be good for me. I didn't think she could be right this time and I didn't want to waste my time. An abrupt knock on the door interrupted my train of thought, I could her muffled voices and footsteps downstairs. Quickly I retreated to my room and onto my bed. The bulky front door opened and closed again followed by footsteps coming up to my room. When @PERSON1 first walked into my room my first thought there was no way we would get along. She was a gorgeous blond girl, obviously popular and very confident. I couldn't stop thinking how she was going to call me freak and poke at my differences like the other girls at school did. ""@CAPS1, what are you reading?"" @PERSON1 asked as she sat on my bed. Come look for yourself."" I replied offering her the book in my hands. I knew she would hate this book. It was about all the microorganisms that live and feed off your body. I was right and as she leaned over cautiously @PERSON1 read the book with a disgusted look on her face. Laughter was boiling up inside me, I couldn't hold it much longer. My small, dull room buzzed with my laughter. @PERSON1 looked over at me with another strange look on her face and began to laugh along with me. Once the laughter had stopped and the ice was broken we began to talk about other interests. @DATE1 short hours flew by and we were finding plenty of things we had in common. We shared funny stories, introduced new music to one another, and talked about hobbies. I couldn't remember the last time I felt so in-tune with someone, especially someone I had just met! Suddenly our conversation was interrupted by a brisk knock on the door downstairs, we looked at each other and smiled. In that smile I saw a real person smiling at me with real pleasure showing through. Very much unlike previous encounters with kids at school. Downstairs we said our good-bye's to one another. As the new, cool @DATE3 air began to rush through the opened door I reached out to hug her. To my surprise she took my gesture and ran back to hug me. Her hair smelled of hair products and powder, a smell very unfamiliar but surprisingly comforting. Once she was gone for the night I began to think. I really liked @PERSON1 and I wanted to see her again soon. I felt accomplished in some way and fulfilled to have this bright future opportunity brought to me so easily and perfectly. Guilt also struck me as I realized how I had felt about @PERSON1 at first. For someone who had been judged through most of school I had been very hypocritical. That night I stayed up later than usual thinking about the next time I could see her, how she had looked and tried to understand how we could get along so well. Despite these questions haunting the edge of my every thought I slept happily, thinking of the next time I would get to see her. All of those @DATE1 questions and concerns have been answered in the @DATE1, and we are the closest friends. Not long after we started hanging out more often, we began to like one another a lot. One of my favorite parts about our relationship is how people get so confused to see us two different so close to one another. We can take the stares, comments and anything else we struggle with today and find a way to laugh together to reduce the importance of it. I have thanked my mom over these @DATE1 for many things, but mostly for what she has done for my relationship. If it hadn't of been for her my life would probably of been much darker. No one on that cold night expected this one meeting to evolve into our beautiful relationship. Laughter is an extremely vital part of a relationship whether it is being built or being kept up. Thanks to laughter excelling conversation @DATE1 @DATE1 ago, I have had the best experience I could of ever asked for.",20.0,21.0,,41.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,20,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

My adoptive parents have always been truthful @CAPS4 me about her an why @CAPS1 gave me up. I accept how my life has turned out an im very grateful, @CAPS2 i wasn't adopted i wouldnt have gotton @CAPS8 know my @PERSON1, The most loving, adventurous, funny, wise women you would ever meet.

No wait thats a lie @PERSON1 @CAPS3 nature period.  @CAPS1 has taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate everything around me exspecially nature, @CAPS4 me an her we are closer then anything you could think of, @CAPS2 shes the sky im her stars, @CAPS2 i' m a bird @CAPS1's my wings. @CAPS6's that simply. @CAPS6 hasn't always been easy for her an me, but the way we know how @CAPS8 cope is @CAPS8 laugh at everything an everyone, not in a bully or make fun of kind a way, but a good way. Laughin for me an my @PERSON1 comes like a second nature @CAPS8 us, @CAPS6's what keeps us going an know that everything will be okay.

21069,8,"Laughing is one of the things we do best. @PERSON1 and I talk almost everyday and never get tired of laughing. We talk about everything and even if it is the saddest thing in the world we will be able to make it funny in a way, it's just one of those things we do. As best friends it's our job to make each other feel better, and if one calls the other crying it's their job to make the them laugh and if it is funny for both @CAPS2 know it was a job well done. In @DATE3, my uncle died, I called her crying my eyes out, she said, everything was going to be okay and to just think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though I was still crying, through those tears there was laughter and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me.  @PERSON1 and I met @DATE1, at @ORGANIZATION1, where we spent a week out of our @DATE1 to get to know new people and getting closer to @CAPS1. That week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole @DATE1, though me and @PERSON1 didn't ""click"" at @ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later found out we were more alike then we thought. Some people say when two people are to much alike the friendship doesn't work. Well, this is true yet false. When @CAPS2 are alike @CAPS2 can talk to each other about everything, yet when @CAPS2 hit those differences, and the other disagrees it starts a fight, but fights just bring people closer together.  Even though me and @PERSON1 don't see each other much, doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state, does that mean they aren't your best friend anymore? No, it just means @CAPS2 don't see them as much as @CAPS2 would like to. Even though we live close to each other we don't always have time to see one another, but, when we do finally get to see each other there isn't a dull moment. About a month after @PERSON1 had gotten in a bad car accident, we went to skate world, @PERSON1 was on crutches so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and making the @TIME1 full of laughter. She was up dancing to the music, on top of seats yelling, ""@CAPS2 wont ever see these people again in your life, why not just have a little fun? "". By the @DATE2 @TIME1 she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools and I don't regret one thing that happened that @TIME1, it was the most I had laughed in about a year. We were dancing and screaming for about three hours, before one the parents got their and after that we all went home. That is a @TIME1 I will never forget. A girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had!  When things don't work out the way we wanted, we just go on with life wishing that it had happen differently, but when we look back a couple years down the road we will see that it was just fine, and it @MONTH1 just make @CAPS2 laugh. somethings are hard to laugh about, but a good thing to do when @CAPS2 get to that point is think of something happy, or funny and try to laugh. Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I have done something good with my life that I was willing to help @PERSON1 with her struggles. To me that makes this life, a life worth living. Though @CAPS2 cant help everyone through every single one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more then @CAPS2 @MONTH1 know.  @PERSON1 and I have planed out many lives we would like to live and looking back now on them all I can do is laugh, because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even if we try our best to make them happen I doubt they will. But, it was worth the laughter and a good time to make them up, and Believe they were going to happen for awhile and I know looking back in a few years we will both laugh. Laughing is a good way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes @CAPS2 think of all the good times @CAPS2 have had in your life, and lets @CAPS2 know that @CAPS2 had fun in your life. Though we fight, in the @DATE2, I don't think anyone will be able to tear @PERSON1 and I apart, with all the laughter that is done.

21070,8," Laughter. Something everyone does. Its natural, organic, normal. They say children laugh more than adults, maybe that's @CAPS6 keeps them children. They can still let that deep instinct to enjoy themselves be expressed in bursts of happy noise. Laughter is always unique to every person. Some have musical laughs, others have deep belly laughs. Then there @CAPS10 those or snort or snicker, the kind of laugh that makes @CAPS8 laugh because @CAPS8 hear it. Those @CAPS10 my favorite. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and I couldn't agree more. Laughing with people has been the greatest influence in my relationships with my friends. I have five girlfriends that I would not be able to live without. They support me, love me, and get me to be bold and get out of my comfort zone. There have been many sleepovers where at two in the morning all @CAPS8 here is the laughter of all of us at some shocking @TIME1 confession or horror at the ""would @CAPS8 rather?"" someone just came up with. One @TIME1 in particular was especially funny. It was last @DATE1 and we were sleeping on @ORGANIZATION1's porch. It was a spectacular @TIME1, the stars were out the air was cool but comfortable and a meteor shower was happening later on that evening. @PERSON3 started the conversation with her favorite catch phrase, ""@CAPS1 guys, hows life?"" We all @CAPS16 because if @CAPS8 @CAPS10 around @PERSON3 for more than and hour @CAPS8 will here this saying a @CAPS2 times.  ""@CAPS3 as five minutes ago,"" I replied.  ""@CAPS4 guys my life has completely changed,"" said @PERSON1 sarcastically. ""@CAPS5 really?"" @LOCATION1 asked, her little body curled up in her sleeping bag, ""@CAPS6 have @CAPS8 had a personality flip, @CAPS11 @CAPS8'@CAPS20 now blond and stupid?""  ""@CAPS7."" @PERSON1 said sarcastically, rolling her eyes, a very @ORGANIZATION1 gesture. We @CAPS16 at the ridiculous mental picture of ""the brain""being stupid.  ""@CAPS8 guys want to play would @CAPS8 rather?"" @ORGANIZATION2 piped in. I had thought she was asleep by now. All I could see was her red hair covering her face. ""@CAPS9!"" yelled @PERSON2, ""I can't handle my mind being filled with horrible mental pictures!"" she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images. ""@CAPS10 @CAPS8 sure? I have some new ones."" @PERSON1 said with her best evil voice, ""@CAPS11 would @CAPS8 rather have to..."" ""@CAPS9!"" we all yelled together and the laughter ensued.  ""@CAPS13 or @CAPS14?"" @PERSON3 suggested. An unintelligible noise came from @ORGANIZATION2's pillow. ""@CAPS6 did @CAPS8 say?"" I asked. She raised her sleepy eyed face. ""I'@CAPS23 too lazy, and unless the @CAPS14 is to be the first one asleep then I'@CAPS23 not playing!"" she dropped her head back onto her pillow.  ""I agree,"" @LOCATION1 added, ""I'@CAPS23 too lazy.""  ""@LOCATION1 it would take @CAPS8 four hours just to get out off this porch cause @CAPS8'@CAPS20 so @CAPS21."" @CAPS16 @PERSON1. ""@PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 not @CAPS21. I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!""  ""@CAPS5 just accept it @LOCATION1, @CAPS8'@CAPS20 @CAPS21!"" ""@CAPS9 @PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!""We continued @CAPS11 this, bantering back and forth till slowly people began to fall asleep, drifting off in the cool @TIME1 air. I was the last awake, and as I watched the meteor shower I had a sudden epiphany. My life was pretty awesome right now.  It was @DATE1, @CAPS9 school, @CAPS9 stress. I was laying on a porch watching a meteor shower listening the @TIME1 sounds and feeling perfectly safe, and I had the best five friends I could ever wish for. We joked and @CAPS16 with each other, but this is the first step to being so comfortable with people that @CAPS8 can tell them everything. Laughing with someone breaks the ice, it brings us closer together. Laying there I suddenly realized that because of all of our joking I felt comfortable enough with these girls to tell them just about everything, and I wanted to. I had never felt @CAPS11 this before. That I could do anything because there were five people that had my back through anything. I smiled to myself and as I closed my eyes I imagined all of the laughter I would get to enjoy with these friends.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,": The essay is clear, focused, and interesting.

**Organization**

* Score: 4
* Comments: The organization is clear and coherent. Order and structure are present, but may seem formulaic. The writing is characterized by clear sequencing and paragraph breaks. An organization that may be predictable. A recognizable, developed beginning that may not be particularly inviting; a developed conclusion that may lack subtlety. A body that is easy to follow with details that fit where placed. Transitions that may be stilted or formulaic. Organization which helps the reader, despite some weaknesses.

**Voice**

* Score: 4
* Comments: A voice is present. The writer seems committed to the topic, and there may be a sense of “writing to be read.” In places, the writing is expressive, engaging, or sincere. The writing is characterized by a suitable level of closeness to or distance from the audience. A sense of audience; the writer seems to be aware of the reader but has not consistently employed an appropriate voice. The reader may glimpse the writer behind the words and feel a sense of interaction in places. Liveliness, sincerity, or humor when appropriate; however, at times the writing may be either inappropriately casual or personal, or inappropriately formal and stiff.

**Word Choice**

* Score: 4
* Comments: Words effectively convey the intended message. The writer employs a variety of words that are functional and appropriate to audience and purpose. The writing is characterized by words that work but do not particularly energize the writing. Expression that is functional; however, slang, if used, does not seem purposeful and is not particularly effective. Attempts at colorful language that may occasionally seem overdone. Occasional overuse of technical language or jargon. Rare experiments with language; however, the writing may have some fine moments and generally avoids clichés.

**Sentence Fluency**

* Score: 4
* Comments: The writing flows; however, connections between phrases or sentences may be less than fluid. Sentence patterns are somewhat varied, contributing to ease in oral reading. The writing is characterized by a natural sound; the reader can move easily through the piece, although it may lack a certain rhythm and grace. Some repeated patterns of sentence structure, length, and beginnings that may detract somewhat from overall impact. Strong control over simple sentence structures, but variable control over more complex sentences; fragments, if present, are usually effective. Occasional lapses in stylistic control; dialogue, if used, sounds natural for the most part, but may at times sound stilted or unnatural.

**Conventions**

* Score: 3
* Comments: The writing demonstrates limited control of standard writing conventions (e.g., punctuation, spelling, capitalization, grammar and usage). Errors begin to impede readability. The writing is characterized by some control over basic conventions; the text may be too simple or too short to reveal mastery. End-of-sentence punctuation that is usually correct; however, internal punctuation contains frequent errors. Spelling errors that distract the reader; misspelling of common words occurs. Capitalization errors. Errors in grammar and usage that do not block meaning but do distract the reader. Significant need for editing.

21071,8," One day, a day before the party for my brother's @DATE1 to be exact. We were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that's were the boy's will be hanging out and sleeping. My cousin @PERSON4 and I were helping mom and the boy's that were already here and their names would be @PERSON5 , @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. @PERSON6 was already here of course because he's the @DATE1 boy. The boy's were suppose to be cleaning the apartment but their boy's and the only things on theirs minds are girls and video games. They played video games instead of cleaning and mom got mad. Lucky for them mom was in a very good mood or they would have got @CAPS7. The last to boy's showed up now.   The last two boy's showed up and their names are @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 is showing up tomorrow after noon. @PERSON6 was so exited that he was turning @NUM1 years old , he said "" I'm @NUM1 years old now no one can tell me what to do"" and I laughed and said ""@PERSON6 go make me a sandwich"" and he said ""@CAPS3"" and I said ""so much for no one can tell me what to do"" and everyone laughed at him. He gave me my sandwich and all the boy's went to the apartment to clean @CAPS7 but when I got in there they set up @PERSON5's x-box @NUM3 and was playing @CAPS7. I told them to get cleaning but they decided not to listen so I got mom and they sure listened to her. She took @CAPS7 and put @CAPS7 on the kitchen table. They were not happy. They finally cleaned the apartment and got the x-bow back. @TIME1 all of us were watching movies and playing broad games then mom told @PERSON4 and I to clean my room , maybe a hour after that she walked by and said "" bed time"" and boy's go to the apartment. The next mourning.  The next mourning @PERSON4 and I woke up to the sun hitting us in the eyes and I said ""what a great way to start off the day"" and @PERSON4 said ""I know"". The best part of today is that we get to hang out with the boy's. When @PERSON4 and I got into the living room everybody was in the kitchen and partly in the living room. @TIME1 that @TIME1 the boy's thought @CAPS7 would be fun if they played cops and rubbers. The apartment was the jail. @PERSON2 , @CAPS2 , @PERSON6 were the cops and @PERSON5 and @CAPS1 were the rubbers. @PERSON4 and I wanted to play so we went outside and ran into @PERSON5 on the otter side of the apartment , he was the only one who knew we were outside. When I was running to hide behind the trees I felling in the hole that turns off the water for the apartment and my leg looked like cottage cheese and @CAPS7 was gushing blood and you could see my bone. I had to stop playing for the @TIME1. Mom told @PERSON4 and I to go to bed.  The next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said ""yes"". I crawled out of bed because I needed to go to the bathroom so @PERSON4 helped me up the stairs and when we were coming down the stairs @PERSON5 saw me hurting and being the amazing boyfriend he is he picked me up and carried me to the couch in the living room and sat me down on the couch and kissed the top of my head and said ""good mourning beautiful"" and I said ""good mourning to you to baby"". Now everybody is standing around for their food to be done. The boy's are making pizza if you wanted to know. Then my little sister @CAPS6 walked in to the kitchen and said ""ma'am I want a cookie"" and mom said "" okay , here you go baby"". @CAPS6 ran off with a very big smile on her face. The boy's got their pizza now and they just went back to the apartment. @PERSON4 and I looked at mom and said ""wow"" mom's like i know. We all laughed and started talking about boy's and friends , family , animals. @CAPS7 was a very fun weekend and even though I got hurt we still made the best of @CAPS7. Even though I got hurt and cant do anything for the next two months or so , we still had a blast with each other and @PERSON6 said "" @CAPS7 was his most favorite @DATE1 he's ever had so far . @CAPS6 wanted her friend to come over but she had fun with mom and @PERSON4 , the boy's when they came in the house and I. Sometimes you got to work with what you got and @CAPS7 might turn out more fun than your normal plan you made. Just make sure your happy with the people around you.

21072,8,"                                        The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4                                          @CAPS5 @PERSON1 is an essential for me to survive this crazy thing called life. So instead of writing about one experience where laughter is a key element I am going to write a montage of true events where laughter shows my true colors as to who I am. I think I should start with my blond moments first seems how that's my natural hair color. When I was little I would take my shirt off, throw it on the ground and be like ""mommy, I can't find my shirt"" @CAPS6 would tell me, ""@PERSON1 @CAPS21 just threw it on the ground"", I would look in all the wrong places and result to crying on the floor. @CAPS6 would pick my shirt off the floor hand it to me and then I would do the same thing all over again. Yeah @CAPS21 could say I was a little embarrassed when I got older and they had it on video camera, but that's what I love @CAPS21 grow up and laugh about what was once embarrassing and @CAPS21 move on.  There was another time when we figured out my initials spell @CAPS7, so whenever I go swimming with my brother and our friends, they start singing the @CAPS8 theme song and I start laughing because if I let them think I don't care they will eventually @CAPS4. Guess what, they still haven't stopped and I am beginning to think I @MONTH1 be stuck with the nickname @CAPS8 for the rest of my life. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 kept rolling when I was in first grade my brother, who @CAPS5 the way was in second grade, decided to tell my first grade teacher I had @CAPS10, @CAPS6 called my parents, who began to laugh like crazy and told her yeah, @CAPS6 does its a little thing called @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14. Looking back its funny because I remember the look on @PERSON2's face; @CAPS21 could say it was classic.  As I advanced in my @CAPS16 years moving into @CAPS15 @CAPS16, I joined an organization; the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 of the @CAPS19 for @CAPS20, where I learned later on that the color black is prohibited at any and all @CAPS19 functions. Well, the night I was initiated I wore all black from my hair accessories to my shoes. I felt no embarrassment just the need to laugh. I found later that I like to make jokes or funny comments whenever I get nervous during a speech, so when I had to get up and give a speech in front of approximately one-hundred and twenty people I made little efforts at making jokes and comments, did I mention I wasn't very @CAPS1 at jokes, but the ceremony went on and people went along and laughed with me, even though I hit my head against a dream catcher.  @CAPS19 has taught me its okay to cry at the depressing things in life, its okay to fear the things that frighten @CAPS21, its okay to love anyone @CAPS21 want, its okay to live your life, but most importantly its okay to laugh at your mistakes. I think that is one thing I will always remember and pass on to my children when I settle down with a family, which won't be for awhile I learned that lesson when I was babysitting my little cousins, who were sick, its a lot of responsibility, its a @CAPS1 thing my brother helped because I would of been nearly lost without him.  I know that because of the people who surround me with their positive attitudes and hearts gold that they have formed me to become a better person, to laugh when there seems no way out, to not only learn from your mistakes, but to laugh at them as well, to show that @CAPS21 have a deeper meaning for the way your life was meant to be lived. Remember that when life hands @CAPS21 lemons take the opportunity to make some sweet lemonade and then throw it on yourself so @CAPS21 and your friends can get a @CAPS1 laugh every once in a while. Thank @CAPS21.",20.0,15.0,,35.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,2,,":**

21073,8,"                Twins For a @CAPS1  Laughter is a large part of who I am. I am a very happy, outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially the laughs that make your stomach feel like its going to fall out of your body and continue laughing on the floor. That's @CAPS23 I surround myself with people that are like me, that's my best friend @PERSON1 and I are like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together @CAPS24's like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughter. The best part of our friendship is that we are alike I think, and we use @CAPS24 to our advantage. One @CAPS1 @PERSON1 and I were taking a stroll downtown. We were just window shopping,when we past a clothing store that had on display a auburn tank top that had blue swirls coming up from the bottom and up one side, also a pair of dark blue jeans with a rip in the knee. @PERSON1 and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like ravenous dogs drooling over a piece of freshly cut meat, an idea hit me.When I turned to @PERSON1 and said "" @PERSON2? (her nickname) @CAPS2 if I was you and you were me when we @CAPS14 meet @CAPS3 later?"". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like @CAPS24 was @CAPS4. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our curves, that were identical, like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern. The only difference was she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we deiced that showing a little neck wouldn't be to bad, @CAPS7 we just threw our hair up in buns and called @CAPS24 good. As we left the store, we got asked if we were sisters, and we replied in a simultaneous ""@CAPS5, kinda"" @CAPS24 was reassurance that if we could trick them, then we could trick anyone.  We comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting @CAPS3. when we were close to the lawn of the library @PERSON1 turned to me and said ""hide behind this tree, tell I head back, and then sneak around back and freak him out!""@CAPS7 I hid behind the tree while she went up to say hello, he asked where I was and she said ""I do not know actually""while she dug in her bag, ""but I think I dropped something down there, I'll be right back, stay put."" ""@CAPS8"" he replied. All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and I hopped down off of an embankment and said ""@CAPS9 I am!"" he was gawking off at a car that was parked a little ways down the road, he jumped a little, and I said ""@CAPS10 did I scare you?"" in an little school girl voice, and he replied ""@CAPS5, of course not!

He was apprehensive at first but he did as I @NUM1 had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned, but he gave me a look of bafflement as he did. When they were face to face @PERSON1 shouted ""@CAPS9 @CAPS13 @CAPS14!"" and @CAPS3 nearly jumped to the moon. @PERSON1 and I were laughing @CAPS7 hard we nearly peed our brand new pants. @CAPS3 in confusion whipped his head between @PERSON1 and I, and said ""@CAPS16 this is interesting"" we continued laughing like buffoons, and @CAPS3 even giggled a little. He told us ""@CAPS18't you two ever do this again!"" and I said ""@CAPS19! We basically are sisters @CAPS7 @CAPS23 not play the part?"" he just glared at me in discontent and @PERSON1 rolled her eyes and said ""@CAPS2? Did the man get scared?"". We both cracked up again and @CAPS3 just smiled cause he knew we were playing around. @CAPS24 was just a blast after that, @PERSON1 and I continued to torment the town as twins. We ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools. We even got @CAPS3 to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach. When @CAPS24 was time to @CAPS14, we ventured to the parking lot where @PERSON1's mother was going to pick us up, she did a triple take when she saw us, she just laughed at us when we got in and asked ""@CAPS23 are you two wearing the same @NUM2 and I just looked at each other and busted out laughing, and we replied ""@CAPS24's a long story"". @CAPS24 was the perfect end to an amazing @CAPS1 being my best friend.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21074,8," Somewhere along the road a guy once said ""a laugh a day keeps the doctor away."" @CAPS1 the hell was he talking about? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until i found out first hand how important those words could be, and how right that unknown genius was. It was just a few years ago when the most traumatic event happened to me.Do you remember that first girl or guy you thought you loved? If you can, do u recall that feeling of heartbreak and utter distraught? Well, if u can then u might understand how I felt...and sometimes do feel. If not you @MONTH1 learn something of importance to which you might realize why you're single. Before that certain event,when @CAPS2 and I would end up fighting, we'd end up making jokes about it to get through. We'd sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying. In one of those sobbing weeping, just obnoxious sounding cries. The kind that pisses you off more than making you feel sympathetic. Back to the later and key point of all of this, when the horrible situation occurred @CAPS2 and i were together for years, two and a half to be specific. yeah, long time I know. The day it ended it happened to be in the middle of math class (can you believe that? the middle of freaking class!) @CAPS4 convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her. It'd be just us, no interruptions. We did this everyday so it wasn't anything to unusual to me. I was thinking ""yeah! i get to work alone with my amazing girlfriend!"" I was such a idiot. I do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down. @CAPS4 was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t-shirt. @CAPS4 had skin so white and unblemished a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it all off dirty blond hair, rose petal lips and believe me on this one unending curves. I was dressed similar. I was in my @PERSON1 t-shirt, black jeans and my signature burgundy beanie. I had natural tan glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes. When I sat down I'm not exactly sure @CAPS1 it was, but I felt like something bad was going to happen. Almost like a oncoming thunder storm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most dreadful words fell out of her mouth like water coming out of a faucet. ""We have to break up"" my heart seized in my chest her other words blurred into one becoming inaudible. I remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help, but laugh at myself silently inside my head. I didn't ever say anything back. I didn't trust my voice enough to be steady and unwavering. Even if my words didn't...my body did. I couldn't control the shaking of my body as if it was having one big muscle spasm. I quietly and quickly walked out of the room making sure to have my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways along with the tiles and eventually grass along with the pouring rain all blurred into one. I just kept on walking and walking, with no wear in mind. Until when i was finally to tired to stop. My cheeks were tear streaked to my jawline and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world to me in my life had ended. As i look back at @CAPS2 and I's relationship, laughter was how we survived and got through a lot. It was however not enough. No amount of trying to laugh it off would help, like those petty arguments we had. I will sometimes though look back on how I reacted and that by itself will make me laugh. I was no better than those people in those movies. Unlike them however, I did not weep and bawl obnoxiously.",20.0,17.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21075,8," Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about.",20.0,15.0,,35.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21076,8," Have you ever got a detention from laughing an inordinate amount in class? If you haven't, you're very lucky. I know that teachers absolutely hate students that don't pay attention in class, or students that will randomly start laughing when they're giving a lecture. I'm that student that will randomly bust up laughing (preferably at my own jokes) in class. In other words, I'm a teachers worst nightmare.  Ring....ring....ring, time for @CAPS1. It was a beautiful afternoon and I was feeling great! When I walked into the class, I automatically noticed that our teacher wasn't his blessedly self. But I ignored it and went on with what I normally do, which is get out my @CAPS2 and crank up the tunes. I like to listen to music because it relaxes me and helps me focus more. The downside to listening to music is that you can't exactly hear everything that great. When I listen to music I have those moments when I feel like I'm in a movie that everything seems like it's in slow motion but you can't hear anything. It's almost like I'm secluded in my own little world and no one can see me or hear me, until I start laughing that is. Finally class started and everyone was being abnormally loud, at this point I was starting to see the steam come out of our teachers ears. He looked like a cartoon character off of bugs bunny. The teacher was getting very indignant and impatient with the class. I didn't exactly pay much attention to him so I went back to listening to my music. After a while, our teacher was now starting to get frenzied with the class even more so he told everyone whoever talks again will get their name written up on the board and you will receive detention.  About five minutes later my friend @PERSON1 comes and walks by me and starts talking to me. When I listen to music, I have a tendency to talk loud because I feel like they can't even hear me. So I start yelling, and she starts to giggle because when I wasn't looking my teacher was just staring at me wondering why I was talking so loud. He turns around and writes my name on the board (that meant I was given a warning). I turn to look at the teacher, oh no here it comes, @NUM1 my laughter is out, I couldn't control myself. When I laugh uncontrollably, I laugh like there's no tomorrow. ""@CAPS3! You owe me thirty minutes of detention!"" said my teacher. One of the biggest problems that I have is I'm very easily amused, I laugh at mainly everything and anything. When my teacher yelled at me, his facial expression was just way too funny, so I began to laugh even harder.  When I start laughing, my friend @PERSON1 usually can't help herself but start laughing with me. She tells the teacher that she was the one that made me laugh so she thought she deserved detention too. So she got what she wanted, detention! One week later, @PERSON1 and I arrived in good old detention with all the other ""rebels"" (that's what I call myself now) it makes me feel tough. The thing that we have learned is that we should never be sitting next to each other. When we sit by each other, we can't stop laughing, but we decided to sit by each other anyways. What do you know, we almost got more detention while in detention, imagine that.  ""@CAPS4's to short to live with tension and regrets, so just laugh it off!"" That motto is what I try to live by everyday. I feel like laughing is a very important part in my @CAPS4, it really helps me forget what is bothering me. Even though I @MONTH1 get in trouble from laughing, I don't regret it one bit. Some people are very serious and they don't know how to let things go so they're always tense. Laughing releases tension and for me I feel like it brings me closer to my friends. I love laughing with my friends and the feeling of your abs hurting from laughing is awesome!Live your live, laugh as much as you can, and love those that mean the most to you.",19.0,20.0,40.0,40.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21077,8,"How Laughter @CAPS1 Laughter can be a huge help when going through difficult times. Like the time when my brother got ran over by a skid steer(tracked loader) at our farm. We didn't know how bad it was going to be @CAPS2 through our time of uncertainty our family was there to be with us and help us through and keep us from getting down. It was just another day on the farm and we were out running the machines. The day was going just fine until after dinner my mom had told me and my brother to go out and cut corn. ""@CAPS2 mom"" me and my brother said in unison. She wouldn't hear it and told us to hurry up and leave. So we went down to the shop and got the skid steer out. My brother, @PERSON1 still hadn't come down and so I started it and started driving towards the garden. I saw my brother coming from the corner of my eye. He was running as fast as he could and I yelled at him to stop and wait @CAPS2 he kept coming. He tried to jump on the front forks @CAPS2 missed and fell. I got out of the cab and saw him lying on the ground crying. My uncle was standing near by when it happened and he called the ambulance. We didn't know what was wrong with him @CAPS2 his leg looked a little funny so we looked closer and saw the bone sticking out of his leg. Finally when the ambulance came they looked him over and asked me some questions about what had happened. I told them all that i could and went back to the house. It was nerve racking to not know what was going to happen to his leg @CAPS2 we just hoped that it wouldn't be very serious. I spent the night at my grandparents house. I had a lot of trouble falling a sleep that night though. The next morning was @DATE1 so I had to go to school. I still didn't know a lot @CAPS2 i did know my brother's leg broke in a compound fracture. The whole school day my friends were helping me feel better by telling jokes and funny stuff and just keeping my mind off the accident. It was hard not knowing what was going on with him. Later that night we went to see him. We learned that he had just broken the big bone in his leg and that it had gone back together just fine. My mom stayed with him the whole time he was in the hospital so things around the house was a little bit different. Me, my dad, and sisters had to clean and take care of the house. It was a pain because I hate doing house work and having to do it all the time was vary boring. When my mom and brother finally got back after about a week things went somewhat back to normal.  My brother had to ware a thing on his leg that sucked the fluids out of the wound to help it heal faster. There was giant screws coming out of his leg that attached to a bar on the outside of his leg. He has healed up just fine though and has a giant scar where the bone came through his leg. It was very nice to have family and friends there to cheer us up and help us get through. And that is why laughter @CAPS1.

21078,8," We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter can show emotions, but can also go to the distance of strengthening a friendship, or relationship. To many people laughter is a very important part of any relationship.  First, Laughter is very important in a friendship. If you cant have a fun happy friendship then you wont have a good friendship. Building up to a friendship is always sometimes difficult. It can take up to a good laugh, to not laughing at all to determine your friendship. Having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings. Knowing that you have someone you can trust, talk to, be there for you, and the most important laugh with is a great feeling.  Also, laughter is important in every childhood memories. Thinking back to when i was little i was always laughing. Even though my mom and dad left me and my brothers i always had my grandparents, brothers, cousins, even aunt and uncles to keep my busy and always have a good time. I think laughter is an important thing being a child because its healthy, you can learn to keep others spirits high and keep others laughing and happy, . and its always good to have a strong, fun, happy relationship with your family.  Last, laughter is very important in a relationship. I think it will build character to your relationship and shows everyone that your happy with the person that your with. Laughter will also build a good and strong healthy relationship and will lead to good things. If you think about it laughter is probably the most important in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person your with it will lead to not getting a divorce and fighting and you will have a strong relationship.  So, therefore after pointing out that laughter is important no matter what age, what gender, friendship, childhood, or relationship you should see that my point is that laughter is important no matter the situation. It helps build a strong person and also builds character to yourself.",15.0,20.0,,35.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21079,8," Have you ever been in an an awkward situation and lightened the mood with laughter? I have, as have many. I find that laughter makes people more comfortable, which allows them to be their own person. Laughter @MONTH1 even help some to attract a positive, friendly crowd, who enjoy funny, happy people. Laughter @MONTH1 not work in this way for everyone, but here are some ways it has helped me. I was at a homeschoolers' group in @LOCATION1 years ago and didn't know anyone there. After walking around a while this girl talked to me. She was funny, and being able to laugh made me more comfortable and I had a fun time. I just had to fin d the right person. Another time where laughter might've helped was when I was invited to a birthday party of a friend I hadn't seen in over two years. Several others were there I hadn't seen in a long while. The whole visit was awkward and all I wanted to do was blend in. I acted like everyone else, but if I'd had laughed and been more comfortable I would've been my own person. When I first came to public school I was nervous to meet new people, and what kind of people there would be. After a week or so people got to see my personality, the funny, happy, laughable person inside, and that clicked with a lot of people. That's why I'm friends with the people I'm friends with now, because our alike personalities matched. Laughter brought me to a good place in life. Laughter can make a lot of people happy and comfortable in awkward situations. It can encourage people to show their own personality and attract people like themselves. I think the world would be a happier place if everyone could laugh.",19.0,15.0,,34.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":**

21081,8,"@CAPS1 up kids my mother said as she was scrambling to get her stuff packed and ready.I knew exactly what i did wrong, I didn't set my alarm on my phone for six am. I set it for six pm and now we are late. Thinking to my self I hurried to get my clothes packed for the week. six pairs of pants, six pairs of shirts, six pairs of underwear, and six pairs of socks. I put my bag next to the front door realizing now that it was next to my other bag I had already packed the day before. My sisters were worse, as girls they take for ever putting on there makeup and and straightening their hair.Finally everyone is packed, but it was now seven am and we were supposed to be to @LOCATION2 by now and were still sitting here at our house. As my sisters are now done and we are in the car we can finally get off to @LOCATION3. We as a family have been planning @CAPS2 for a month and now it's @DATE2! I was really exited to go. By @CAPS2 point I had butterfly's in my stomach.We lived in @LOCATION1, we were only half way through @LOCATION2 with eight out of ten hours left to get to my mom's cousins house. I feel asleep for the first two hours of the ride and I can no longer sleep. I was stuck in the back seat with nothing to do. so I started to sing the never ending song. @CAPS2 is the song that never ends, and it goes on and on my friends."" @CAPS3 my sister in the front seat yelled at me very harshly to shut up. I didn't stop and she yet again yelled at me to stop singing. For a third time I annoyed my sister and she responded with a punch on my arm. For some reason I started to laugh. It didn't hurt and I thought it was funny that she hit me for just singing a silly song.I had a really strange laugh so my little sister started to laugh because I was laughing, then my older sister quite harshly screamed at me and my younger sister to be quite. My older sister yet again punched me trying to get me to stop laughing. By now I was laughing so hard I could hardly breath and my face was turning into a shade of purple. It really was funny when my mom couldn't hold it back any longer and started cracking up and laughing with me and my younger sister. My mom wears dentures, and she was laughing so hard they almost fell out of her mouth while she was driving, we started laughing harder. My stomach felt like it was going to explode from all the laughter.My older sister now turning a dark shade of blue from yelling at us so hard to get us to shut up. She was throwing her arms into the air and screaming one last time to shut up and threw herself back into her seat with a very nasty look of disgust on her face.over the next minute we all stopped laughing and was quiet for the next hour @CAPS3 we stopped and ate. We enjoyed our lunch and got on the road because we still had a long trip on our hands.I very soon felt tired and fell asleep in the most awkward of positions you could ever find in a car. I had my head against the door, my arm over the front passenger seat, one of my legs was on the seat and the other in between the driver and passenger seats.I thought I was pretty lucky sleeping most of the way for we only now had about a half hour till we got to my mom's cousins house. We were in the middle west of @LOCATION3 and the mountains were so beautiful. They were full of color and life with gigantic trees swinging in the wind, squirrels moving about from tree to tree, planting nuts in the ground. It was the farthest I have ever been away from where I lived in @LOCATION1. I was glad it was with my family.My stay in @LOCATION3 was a blur. I can hardly remember most of what happened there. I played with a neighbor kid around the same age as me playing video games and eating unhealthy junk food. My mom was the happiest of us all to get out of @LOCATION1 for a weekend. She had not seen her cousin in about three years and was very happy to see her.It was now @DATE1 was time to get back to our normal lives, so we packed up our stuff and were headed back to our home. I was doing amazing at not talking and making my sister mad for the first minute or so. @CAPS3 I started to sing the never ending song again. I have never laughed so hard in my life.

21083,8," The members of my immediate family are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily startled. Broken dishes are a common occurrence in our house; as are spilled drinks, stubbed toes, and blood-chilling screams whenever the toaster pops up. Though all of us are used to these types of things, not everyone around us is, which can lead to interesting encounters. Many people find pleasure in jabbing me in the sides to hear me scream, and laugh when I trip over the slightest crack in the floor. Though it can get annoying sometimes, it @MONTH1 also give me a reason to get over my pride and laugh at myself, thus relieving any tensions I @MONTH1 have been feeling about the social setting. For example, a few years ago I was staying with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 troop at @LOCATION1. Any situation involving large groups of people can be intimidating, but it is increasingly terrifying when the group is made up of girls, ages four to eighteen, with only a few adults thrown in to make sure the girls do not bludgeon each other to death. Worse still was that where I was staying, which was a hybrid somewhere between a cabin and a tent, the majority of the girls were in middle school and, needless to say, we did not always get along. Despite the fact that we were not all the best of friends, though, there were times when we were able to get past the petty differences, such as who was cool and who was not, and enjoy the time we had to talk and joke around with people who were in similar places in life. On one such occasion, I was attempting to make my bed on one of the top bunks, and was in the process of stretching my sheet over the petrified mattress which @MONTH1 have possibly been around in @NUM1 @CAPS3.C. Being the intelligent person that I am, I decided to lean against the wall behind me for balance, forgetting, of course, that there was in fact no wall, but only a thin, cloth-like material which could not support my weight. The second I realized what I had done, I reached about frantically for something to hold on to and tried in vain to keep myself from plummeting backwards to the floor and my certain death. Milliseconds before I would smash into the hard wood floor, I managed to grab a hold of one of the bars on the side of the bed and hung on for dear life, swinging back and forth and back and forth. Finally, I let go and propelled myself, almost gracefully, onto the bed sitting underneath mine. It was a very long time before the laughter died down. In that short amount of time, cliques and biases and grudges were all forgotten as we became not just a bunch of random girls placed in a room together, but a group with our own strengths and weaknesses; passions and flaws. Though the adolescent years are incredibly difficult and there are many times when it feels like you are the loneliest person in the world, it is always comforting to know that there are other people who laugh and cry just like you and experience many of the same joys and embarrassments as you do. One of the most essential skills to learn is that you have to be able to laugh at yourself from time to time and let yourself be vulnerable in front of other people. We @MONTH1 not all be the same, but we all have the same basic desires for love, acceptance, and laughter.",20.0,21.0,,41.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21085,8,"While living in @LOCATION5 I met the two people, whom are now my best friends, @PERSON1 @CAPS14 @CAPS1 @PERSON6. I met them both in entirely different ways. @PERSON1 threw school, @CAPS14 @CAPS1 threw paintball.  I met @PERSON1 when she moved from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. her dad was in the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS14 had been transferred to the base that was close to where I lived. We had two classes @CAPS14 lunch together. At first her @CAPS14 I didn't really talk much. It wasn't until one of my friends, @PERSON3, brought her to sit with us during lunch. Our friend @PERSON4 was overly hyper that day @CAPS14 ended up falling backwards in his chair @CAPS14 scaring some girls who'd been walking by at the time. We laughed so hard our faces went cherry red. After lunch we had class together, so we walked together @CAPS14 talked about lunch. I then asked her to sit with me during @CAPS3. We could not stop talking to save our lives. Luckily it was a free sketch day, for had it not have been we might have been in some trouble. After about a week had gone by @PERSON1 @CAPS14 I found out we had so much in common, it seemed almost unreal. Never had I met a girl who could make me laugh so hard that I actually enjoyed hanging out with every day. She'd make faces @CAPS14 tell me stories about her past that would make me just bust out laughing. We talk almost every other day threw the internet, @CAPS14 even though she's over @NUM1 miles away, she can still make my stomach hurt from all the laughing. As for @CAPS1, he grew up in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5, then later on moved to @LOCATION4. We met while my dad, brother, @CAPS14 I went paint balling at a place called ""The @CAPS5"". It was a slow day. Not as many people were at the fields as normal, @CAPS6 some how there weren't enough tables. We offered to share ours with two guys whom I found out on were @CAPS7 friends, @CAPS8 @CAPS14 @CAPS9. As it got later in the day @CAPS1 @CAPS14 a few other friends, @PERSON5 @CAPS14 @PERSON2, arrived. The games got a bit more interesting, but still not one person had been able to shoot me out before the referee called time. I was starting to get irritated with the lack of experienced players, when finally I felt two sharp paint @CAPS14 heard a splat. I'd taken shots to the leg, mask, @CAPS14 trigger finger. When the game was over I spotted the guy who'd got me out. That person being @CAPS1. I ran over to him @CAPS14 said ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13"". He laughed @CAPS14 said ""that wasn't luck, I chose get you out"". I asked ""well then why haven't you got me out before? huh? You know that was so totally a @CAPS12 @CAPS13"". He returned with ""I was just going easy on you, I didn't wanna make you feel bad"". By then I had a smile on my face @CAPS14 a giggle in my voice ""sure, that's why"". We continued to joke about the game, @CAPS14 the people who were playing that day. When it was time for me to go he wrote his e-mail on a small torn piece of cardboard, @CAPS14 asked me to keep in touch. As soon as I got home I sent an e-mail saying ""I still think it was a @CAPS12 @CAPS13"". Ever since that day we've been best friends. Still in almost every conversation one of us @CAPS8 mention the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, @CAPS14 it makes us laugh every time. Though I don't get to see my best friends every day, We still make each other laugh long distance. It's just that now I get to spread the laughter to new people, @CAPS14 hopefully I'll get to make more wonderful friends like the two I've already discovered.",17.0,20.0,,37.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

For the first time I spent the night at his house, the day before we were outside all day running around his yard and jumping off their roof. @CAPS3 was all very fun and entertaining but no matter what we did @ORGANIZATION1 had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. ""this looks like that!"", or ""she sounds like this!"" @CAPS4 his tone of voice and his unique way of shouting @CAPS3, I could not stop laughing. @CAPS3 was unbearable, @CAPS3 made me laugh so hard and for so long that my stomach would begin to hurt and @ORGANIZATION1 himself would begin laughing from watching me slowly collapse from the uncontrollable laughter.@CAPS3 did not stop there, later that evening we stayed up almost the entire night watching @CAPS1 videos on @CAPS6 and playing @CAPS7 on the @NUM1. The laughter got even greater as we were both becoming extremely tired and our minds were racing all over our thoughts, we laughed until the point where I fell over laughing and holding my stomach. Every word that came out of my cousins imparable mouth made me burst out laughing as if I was hearing the funniest joke for the first time ever.The next morning I had an immense muscle pain in my chest, a sign of a fun and humorous night. even then, @ORGANIZATION1 still had a way to turn my stomach pain into a @CAPS1 subject. The next morning we had breakfast and @CAPS3 was just as fun as the night before. Listening to the nonstop comments and jokes on every thought and every subject and every thought possible. The day continued @CAPS4 the ever-lasting laughter between my cousin and I. Later as I left I though to my self how much more fun I'll have the next time I come to visit.

21087,8," One day is was almost @CAPS1 and my sister, my mom, and I were all in the kitchen making desserts and a bunch of food for @CAPS1 eve dinner. My mom had to leave and go to the store to get more ingredients. Once my mom left my sister and I were still busy working away in the kitchen. I was working on one thing and she was working on another. Finally she was done with making the cookies and decided to help me with the lemon blossoms ( little lemon glazed cakes). The directions called for a fourth of a cup of lemon juice. @CAPS4 i told my sister to get the lemon juice out of the lemons. At this point in time I am making the little cakes, my sister yells at me and asks "" do I just squeeze @CAPS3?"" and I thinking she cut @CAPS3 says yes. Well I was wrong my sister yells at me again and says "" @CAPS3 isn't working."" @CAPS4 i turn around to find her squeezing an un-cut lemon trying to get the lemon juice out of @CAPS3 I just looked at her told her she needed to cut @CAPS3 and started laughing. I don't think I have ever laughed that hard. As I am on the floor crying because I am laughing @CAPS4 hard my mom comes into the kitchen with a bag full of grocery's and the first words out of her mouth were "" @CAPS5 did @CAPS6 do."" @CAPS7 if you can believe @CAPS3 i started laughing even harder. Also my sister to this day is still called lemons. This is because my family and I thought @CAPS3 was @CAPS4 funny that all of our family and friends should know about this little experience my sister had with lemons. From this experience i have learned that laughing is important in @CAPS4 many ways, @CAPS3 can bring friends and family closer together, @CAPS3 can make any relationship stronger. This experience in the end made my sister and I a lot closer in many ways and now we always laugh together and I would rather laugh than fight with her. My sister and I since this incident have become @CAPS4 much closer to the point now that we can tell each other anything and everything. I think everyone should laugh because you might not know that laughing over the stupidest thing could make any relationship better and make the two people closer. @CAPS4 live life to the fullest and laugh as much as you can because you never know when a good laugh could help you become friends with someone or bring you and someone closer than ever.",17.0,17.0,,34.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21089,8," After a long day at the @ORGANIZATION1 mom said it was my turn to decide where we went to dinner that night. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because I love their seafood. We got @CAPS6 legs, popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp. After the food we got two slices of double chocolate lava cake. For some reason it sent us into a fit of laughter. We laughed so hard, we started to cry. We had just finished going clothes shopping at the @ORGANIZATION1 and mom said that I could pick where we went out to eat. My brother started whining about it but mom said it was fair because he got to choose last time. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 which is what my brother said he would have picked anyway. I picked that restaurant for two reasons, first because it was close to the @ORGANIZATION1, and second because I love seafood. Mom didn't have a lot of money so she said we should all share a few things instead for everybody getting their own. We bought two pounds @CAPS5 @CAPS6 legs, and order of popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp (mainly for herself). I'm kind of glad we all shared because it was cheaper and it was just the right amount of food so we didn't have to take home boxes. We never eat leftovers anyway. After our dinner my brother and I begged our mother to buy a dessert. after much thought and convincing she said alright and ordered two slices of the best cake I've ever tasted in my entire life!It was so rich my mom and I could barley finish our slice. My brother gulped his down with ease. After we were done the waiter came by and replaced our plates with the tab.  We all glanced at it and decided not to get dessert again(which never actually happened). Then mom got a bad case of the giggles. Shortly after my brother and i caught the giggles like a disease. Giggles turned into laughter and the laughter became hysterical. We couldn't seem to figure out what was so funny or how it happened. People were starting to stare at us but we still couldn't contain ourselves. Pretty soon our eyes started to water and then there were tears. Tears of joy I'd assume but I new one thing for sure, we had to get out of there. Mom managed to pay the tab just fine, but as soon as she got in the car and herd me and my brother laughing, she started busting up again! She was absolutely convinced it was the cake. she said there is no other reasonable explanation that we would laugh and laugh about nothing. Now I believe that statement because we've tried every other dessert and none of them had the same effect on us. We go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh. I guess its not just the seafood that I like. I rather enjoy the cake too. We call it the double chocolate laugh cake.",16.0,20.0,,36.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The writing is clear and focused.

21090,8,"The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 friends and I, always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time. @CAPS2 friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different. Both are active, humorous girls. You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that show's otherwise. @PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has a tint of olive green. Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. @CAPS2 other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her belly button. The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue.  One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full cushion couch, that comfort every part of @CAPS2 body. Two hours fly by and the girls got it. They both had each leg steps and every movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back-up dancers. After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording. Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button.  The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps. Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other. It was silent, except for the music playing. Each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter. @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, get up, crying from laughing and apologize to each other. All of this happened with me recording. After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video.  Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for @CAPS2 friends.

21091,8,"  Can you imagine life without laughter? Life without laughter is plain, dull, and boring. Laughter is an important part in life. There would be nothing to look forward to if laughing didn't exist. Laughter creates memories, relationships, and it fills in the awkward silence between two people.   Some people don't realize how important laughing is. Life without laughter is like life without water. I think that's how important laughter really is. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is true, but laughing is more then just an element. It's way more important than that. Well I guess we could all live without laughter, but who would want to?  No laughter means no fun times like: swimming, water parks, ice skating, dancing, etc. Those fun things can lead to laughing. Without anything fun to do no one would look forward to tomorrow. Everyday would be a waste, if there wasn't any laughter in the world.   Some people might just think that laughing is just an element. Why is that? Laughter is important enough to be more than that. For example water is an element because it has something to do with the earth. It stands for the ocean. Laughter doesn't fit in that category. Laughing has such a huge impact on our lives. Laughing makes everything tens time better. Laughing creates memories, memories creates relationship. That's why laughter is an important part in any relationship. It's amazing how the smallest thing can make such a big difference in our lives.",15.0,19.0,,34.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,3,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21092,8,"The @CAPS1 of Laughter.  Laughing is a huge part of most everyday life. It is a very common emotion that I see hundreds of times a day. Whether it be from something as simple as a funny face, a joke, a picture, and even little things people do or say can bring laughter to even the most serious of people. @CAPS4 friends and I laugh constantly. We can make something funny out of pretty much anything. I think being able to laugh, and joke around are very good traits to have as a person because it makes life so much more fun and optimistic.  I can't even count the number of times I have been in a complete laughing fit because of @CAPS4 friend @LOCATION1. She is by far one of the funniest people I have ever met in @CAPS4 entire life. Though she is extremely funny, she is not exactly the brightest crayon in the box. She asks questions after people already tell her the answer, she says exactly what I say after I say it without even noticing that I had already said it before her, and sometimes she even trips on the concrete while racing someone to her car after practice. The things she does @MONTH1 not be super intelligent sometimes, but they sure can give anyone a good laugh.  I remember not even a week ago I was in the car with @LOCATION1 on the way to volleyball practice, and she just belted out the wrong words to the song we were listening to. What made it even more funny was the fact that even though she knew the words were wrong she kept singing like she knew every word. At the end of the song we laughed so hard we cried. By the time we got to practice her and I had been laughing for about ten minuets straight. During practice our @CAPS3 had been explaining directions to one of the drills. She told us loud and clear to serve the ball to spots one and five @CAPS2. @LOCATION1 not fully understanding the directions, decided she should ask and make sure it was all clear to her. So she put her hand up and asked, ""@CAPS3, so do we @CAPS2 serve to spots one and five?"" @CAPS4 whole team broke out into hysterical laughter. @LOCATION1 who didn't understand stood there looking confused, but when she finally understood why we were all laughing she joined in. That happened about three more times throughout our two and a half hour practice. She even got put in front row which made us all laugh because she is very short and looked really funny next to the six foot one girls standing right next to her. By the time practice was over I think we had gotten a better workout from laughing then from playing volleyball. On our way out to the car, @LOCATION1 decided she wanted to race a girl on our team to her car. @CAPS5 agreed and they took off in a dead sprint. You could see the determination to win in @LOCATION1's face, and all of a sudden they were no where to be found. I ran up the stairs to see who had won, @CAPS2 to find @LOCATION1 face down on the ground with @CAPS5 sitting next to her laughing hysterically. I felt bad, but it was so funny I couldn't help but to laugh. We sat there laughing for a good fifteen minutes, and we laughed about it all the way home. That was the icing on the cake to one of the funniest days I have ever had. I will never forget that day and all the times we laughed together. I think @LOCATION1 and I being able to laugh so much together brings us closer as friends because even if we get irritated with each other, or something bad happens, we can always find a way to laugh about it in the end, and that is something every good friendship should have. Laughter can't always make everything better, but it can bring @CAPS1 so someones day, and you never know the positive effect a little laugh can have on even the grumpiest of people.

The best place to look is in the hallways, especially @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1, during lunch, @CAPS2 after @ORGANIZATION1. Most of the people I will tell you about are friends of mine. There are also a lot of people I don't even know the names of. There is even a teacher I'll mention something about. Well enough chit chat, lets get to it shall we? I will first start with the teacher. I forget her name but she likes to talk with a @CAPS1 accent. She is also very enthusiastic, @CAPS2 I do mean enthusiastic. She often says, ""@CAPS3 we go!"". It's very funny. I have never seen her without enthusiasm. Many of the students are really disturbed by it. It can be annoying at times but at least she's not all gloomy or other. In fact we might even need more like her at this @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 many others. There is also a student who is also very enthusiastic, not all the time but quite often is he. His name is @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is quite a jolly kid. He loves to sing. I do mean he loves to sing. Even if he doesn't know the words to the song he is singing, he will sing. People always joke about him around him. The jokes are usually mean jokes, but he puts up with them @CAPS2 laughs along. I really do have to give him that much credit. It would be hard for just about anyone to put up with such rude words, let alone laugh with them. But enough of that. He is very jolly @CAPS2 really makes you laugh, which is really great. Don't stop being funny @CAPS4. There is a funny pair of boys who can knock your shoes @CAPS3, perhaps even literally with what they do. These two boys, named @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1, are very humorous, as well as dangerously humorous. Ever heard of a @CAPS6? It is a brand of a toy that is very fun for little kids, as well as big kids. This toy is shaped like a bowl. You turn it inside out, aim the rim at the ground, @CAPS2 drop it. When it hits the ground, it pops up into the air. Well, @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 love playing with the @CAPS6, so much to the point that they found a new way to play with it. Instead of hitting the ground with it, they hit each other with it! They love to hurt each other. Eventually, though, the @CAPS6 got very worn out @CAPS2 tore. It needed to retire from its rough job, but @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 wouldn't let it. They just couldn't stop playing with it. @PERSON2, @CAPS9, @CAPS2 I haven't seen them playing with it lately. We think it might have broke. Ha ha! Never go wondering throught the hallways with @PERSON2, even if you have a destination. Trust me on this, you don't want to! @PERSON2 gets destracted very easily in the hallways. If she sees someone that she's wants to talk to, she doesn't tell you. She just twirls around @CAPS2 rushes over to them. For this, always have her take the lead if you do go with her; at least you'd know when she wonders @CAPS3 the trail. Never the less, @PERSON2 is still very humorous. She makes lots of random sounds. You get completely @CAPS3 guard @CAPS2 just can't help to laugh at how weird sounding those sounds are. @CAPS9 on the other hand, not only does sounds but also does hilarious facial expressions. She always tries to mimic the funny things her goats @CAPS2 pets do when she tells us about them. Together, @CAPS9 @CAPS2 I are very funny. In the @DATE1 finals started, we were drawing such goofy pictures of each other @CAPS2 random things. I drew her as a stick figure going to the moon, but the moon was very far away. We cracked up! She once redrew a little comic her brother thought of more than a year or two again. In the comic, it was a very ugly man who was telling his friends that they were going to a night club, but the ugly man turned out to be a woman. During finals, there was also a guy pulling is friend through the hallways by the arm. The friend said that it was very comfy. Then, they told a teacher about it! Ha ha ha! So you see, @LOCATION1 is much more than an ordinary @ORGANIZATION1. You could probably call it a clown @ORGANIZATION1 if you wanted to. Ha ha ha ha! You would never truly know just how many ha ha's I say a day until you visit, so come on over. We will let you join the fun!",20.0,20.0,42.0,42.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

21094,8," Everybody knows that long car rides can be both physically, and mentally exhausting. Picture a family of four : a mother, a father, and two daughters in @CAPS1. The father is behind the wheel, the mother is in the passenger seat, the older sister is on the left side of the back seat, and the younger sister on the right side. The sun is rising, and you're still on the road. The father is tired, after driving all night. The mother just woke up, yawning, and is wondering how much further until the destination. The sisters are looking out of their windows with extremely bored expressions. Even with cups of coffee, and loud music the atmosphere is still lifeless, extremely dull. What could possibly bring up this lifeless atmosphere? My guess, a form of entertainment. As a young child, I was always on the road. Moving from place to place, because of my father's work. At the time, we were living in a state known for it's snow. @ORGANIZATION1. Wonderful wildlife, breathtaking views, and beautiful landscapes, untouched by man. During the long winter months, the snow covered the ground, like a blanket on a bed. You could wake up in the morning with two new feet of snow. Although, despite living in a cold, isolated state, the summers were extremely hot. A total twist to someone unfamiliar with @ORGANIZATION1's weather. This was around a decade ago, so the enviroment might've changed, but nevertheless, it is still a breathtaking, beautiful state. After coming home from school on a cool @DATE1 day, my mother told me to start packing my room. I knew we were due to leave that @DATE1, but I was still hesitant on leaving my friends. Every time that we moved, I had to say a heart breaking goodbye to the friends I knew for the few years I lived there. I went to my room and started to pack for a long, long trip. My father came to me and told me we are moving by car. He asked my sister and I to go with him so he could pick up the uHaul. We went to check out the sizes, and the condition it was in. As usual, the trucks weren't in the best of condition for moving over a long distance, but it's better than nothing. My father drove it back home, with my sister and I, and my father started to put the packed boxes in the truck. My mother, my sister and I finished packing the rest of the boxes. The boxes with valuable, and mandatory items were stuffed in my mom's @CAPS1, along with our cats in their cages. After getting everything packed, and loaded, the hired uHaul employees drove the uHaul away to our new destination, @LOCATION2. Everyone had mixed emotions about leaving. My mother loved her neighbours, my father had some amazing coworkers, my sister and I made some spectaular friends, but we had to say our goodbyes to our friends. It's not the first time, and it's not the last time, but every time it still hurts. The times we spent together, will always being in our memories! Off we go! To our new temporary home. Driving from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. The only thing that I didn't like, was that we had to be in @LOCATION2 in less than a week. A week to drive that long way? Less stops, more driving, and no fun, or sight seeing... a total drag!! It was really chatty and energetic in the beginning, but everyone soon got sick of being on the road. My sister's body didn't handle it well in the beginning, and neither did mine. Half way to @LOCATION2, all conversations stopped. The atmosphere started to fade, and so did the excitement. There was absolutely nothing to do in such a small area. I wanted to try to make the rest of the drive fun, so I started to sing in my tone deaf way. Since I was so young, my voice cracked midway through the song we were listening to, which caused in uproar of laughter! My mother started to say that I was simply adorable, and my father started to mock me. My sister started to sing, too, and before you knew it, everyone was singing along! Spirits were high, and everyone was having fun singing, and laughing. We started being more active after that, too! The rest of the trip down south was full of energy, and both time and distance passed quickly. It's always fun to spend time with family, but it'll be even better if you spend the time in a fun, exciting way! Make things fun, keep a positive, enjoyable outlook on everything!",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21095,8," Laughter can not only be a benefit to ourselves but to others as well. We only seem to use it whenever you feel the need to become happy, but in reality it shouldn't be the only reason why. Laughter is not only being able to feel better but to let out what you need to let out. Being able to enjoy yourself is pride and you should feel better about yourself. Whenever you laugh, how do you feel? Do you feel like the world is lifted off of your shoulders and you feel better about yourself? I don't mean you have to laugh so loud and so much that you fall off your chair and roll around but a simple chuckle would do the trick. Watch your favorite movie or go have fun with friends, as long as you are laughing you will and should feel better about yourself. That brings us to what happens around @CAPS2 family.  When I was younger I would go on trips with @CAPS2 family up to @LOCATION2. At the time I lived in @LOCATION1. Every @DATE1 we would cram anywhere from five to nine people in a van and be on our way. Having hardly any space of your own you would think it wouldn't be any fun. All in all we would have some fights about where to stop on the way from food or when to turn but nothing too serious. Being younger then everybody I was wildly bored. So to fix the problem I would make @CAPS2 family tell jokes, make funny faces, do something. Right when somebody would let out a joke or made a face, I would crack up laughing. Pure bliss and pure innocent. It didn't mean that they were funny or that they were even trying but to let up the intense shoulders, I would laugh. When we would get to where we were staying on @CAPS2 great grandparents land, we would cram yet another time, in a small area for our sleeping. Everybody would get a cot and would have to endure the warm daylight and the harsh cold bitter @TIME1. The cold nights were the ones that got to all of us the most, because @CAPS2 great grandparents had land meant that the place we were to stay at wasn't filtering heat. Sleeping bag and the clothes on your back were the only thing that we were able to get. So when the sun slipped slowly from shinning its bright light among us, we'd bundle up. Knowing me I did not listen to what @CAPS2 family sad and I would drink tons of water before I rest @CAPS2 head against the cot.  If you have common sense, which when I was younger did not. You would know that if you drink a lot before you go to bed and having the cold surround your body, you would have to use the restroom at some point during the @TIME1. Because @CAPS2 aunt was only @NUM1 years older then me, should would be the one that would have to wake up to walk me outside, down the driveway, to the porter potty, wait for me, then go back to sleep while trying to shake off the shivers that controlled her like the puppet master. Knowing @TIME1, she was not happy with @TIME1 situations, I'm sure nobody would be. The last time she took me, she made sure it was the last time she would get up to take me to the restroom.  The @TIME1 came that she had to take me. We started walking down the driveway. The wind was not like other nights, ripping every which way and piercing through @CAPS2 skin. Another odd thing about @TIME1 was instead of the dull tired face @CAPS2 aunt usually would have, she was awake, more the awake, she seemed to have a slight grin on her face. Since it was pitch dark she had the flash light with her. She opened the door to let me in and shinned the light down in the cracks so I would be able to see more clearly. Once I was done, I felt the shaking of the porter potty and heard in the voice of a monster the ""@CAPS1 y was coming to get me, run, run run!"" @CAPS2 blood rushed all over, warmth is what I remember feeling. Pushing the door open, screaming, running for @CAPS2 ""safety"" is what went through @CAPS2 mind. As I realized @CAPS2 aunt wasn't with me, I looked back. Only to find her laughing uncontrollably at what just happened. The meaning behind @TIME1 would be that you can just turn a bad situation into a good one if you rearrange the problem. You can turn it into a laughing matter instead of a dreaded time. @CAPS2 aunt making me do something she would think was funny would be a better sense for her and relieve her from whatever she thought she felt. Its a cause and effect placement. Causing me to panic effected her to be at more of an ease.",19.0,16.0,,35.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,18,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

21096,8," Have you ever felt really good after you laughed a lot? Well studies have shown that after you laugh you not only feel better, but it's a great way to lose calories. One time when I felt bad my cousin came over and made me laugh. It was a very important part of our relationship, she to only made the day better but put more energy in it. When people don't laugh how can you have as much fun?  Studies have shown laughing does a lot for your health. It increases a certain blood flow in your brain which helps a person to be more energetic and happy. It has also shown that laughing leads to a longer life span. Also every time a person laughs it helps a person burn calories. If it's healthy for you why not laugh a lot? Just think, if nobody laughed how would this world be? It would be dull and full of unhappy people, just like this one time when my cousin came over to see me.  One day I was feeling down and depressed. Nothing was going my way and it was ending up a very bad day. Then all of a sudden my cousin came to @ORGANIZATION1 and surprised me. I was in @ORGANIZATION1 one day after school and looking at some things when she came in @ORGANIZATION1 and snuck up in back of me and scared me. We both started laughing so hard. She made a bad day turn into a fun one. We had a movie night and ate candy and pickles all night. We made songs up and sang them. We had the best time of our lives. All night long we had this party. I don't know what would happen to everybody if none of us ever laughed.  If we didn't laugh then our relationship certainly wouldn't be as strong. It would seem like we were sad or depressed all the time. If their was no laughing I wouldn't look forward to seeing her as much if we just sat around and didn't laugh. Laughing for me is a huge part of having fun in any relationship. It shows your comfortable with the person and are having fun also. If you have ever been down and wanted to give up, you know that's not fun at all. But whether you watch a funny movie or talk to your friend and it makes you laugh, you know what joy it puts in your life. So laughing must be an important part of you life or in any relationship you have.  Overall laughing for me is one of the most important things a person can do to make another person feel welcome and comfortable around you. Also a great way to have fun and lose calories at the same time. If you need some happiness in your life then watch a funny movie or hang out with people that make you laugh.",20.0,17.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":**

21097,8,"Social @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people think of laughter as a way of showing how you feel, almost like an emotion. I look at laughter in a different way. Laughter is a form of communication. Sure you @MONTH1 laugh when something is funny, but the truth is that you can control it. So @CAPS5 do people laugh? They laugh to convey a message; basically they are letting you know that what you said or did was amusing to them. Overtime, laughter can build relationships, or even start them, all because when someone laughs at you or with you, you are sharing a common ground. I know that laughter is an important thing in my life because, without it, I would have never met my best friend. When I began sixth grade, I was scared. I was scared that I would lose all of my old friends and become one of those kids who sits alone in the cafeteria every day wishing that he had someone to eat his greasy pizza with. Of course I was overreacting, but the thought was always lingering in my mind all through the first few days. Soon I even began to notice that my friends were actually find new people to hang out with, and I was beginning to feel as though I was becoming that outcast I had feared to be. Then I met him. He was a skater kid with dark hair down past his eyes and white, almost pale, skin. I was with one of my few friends, @CAPS3, when I saw him riding around near the front of the school. I didn't really think much of him besides the fact that he had some of the coolest shoes I had ever seen. I was actually surprised when @CAPS3 walked up and started to talk to him like he had known him forever. I walked with him to avoid the image of being any more of an outcast. As soon as we are standing in front of him, he says something like an insult that I would usually brush off as nothing, but this time for some reason made me really mad. I said things back and before I knew it, we were in verbal warfare. In the end I knew one thing: I hated that kid, and he hated me.  Towards the middle of the year, our school had a dance. It was the first dance I had ever been to and I had butterfly's in my stomach. I got a ride with one of my old friends, @DATE1. I liked @DATE1 because he was never judgmental or anything like that, he was just friendly. When we were in the car driving to the middle school, he told me that he had to pick some else up, which didn't really bother me at all until we got to the house. The house wasn't very impressive it could have been a cardboard box for all I cared. When i saw the the kid's left foot step out of the house I knew exactly who's shoe it was. As he got in to the car, I pretended as if I hadn't seen him. I failed. The whole car ride was nothing but awkward. When we got to the dance I walked on the right side of @DATE1 to avoid confrontation. @DATE1 scenced the tension and stopped walking. What he said next surprised me a little. ""@CAPS5 don't you guys just get along?"" We both stood there, eyes locked, when skater kid made another one of his ""nice comments"". I thought it was going to be the beginning of the year all over again, but I did something I didn't expect to do: I laughed. He laughed too. It was almost as if for the first time ever, we were friends. The whole night we hung out and danced like crazy. We had become friends.  During the rest of the year, we became better and better friends. We went over to eachother's houses and hung out at school. That was when I realized that we were best friends. Even now, in ninth grade we are still best friends. It's crazy how one small giggle can escalate into that, but that's what happened. I don't know how laughter can do that, or @CAPS5 I even laughed that night, but one thing is certain: laughter is important.

21098,8," Entering into the classroom, I began to shiver from anxiety. I was the new student in the fourth grade, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS1 school kept my head swimming with questions, which I put aside as I stepped into the room with a large white ""@NUM1"" on the exterior wall. I swear, I could feel my bones literally shaking because of my nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me as I came in. I noticed that they were all surrounding this @CAPS4-go-lucky brunette. No one really even took note that I was there until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked back at that brunette who was previously surrounded by the group of my to-be peers. She smiled at me as I stood there, with my feet uncontrollably glued to the ground, looking blankly at her for a few seconds. When someone told me this girl was the other new student in their class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I soon became green with envy over her because of all the attention she got. I was unintentionally a fairly jealous child, and when I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend and I got somewhat ignored, I stomach slowly twisted in knots more and more each day as I began to form feelings of suspicion and dislike towards this girl. Even her name sounded suspicious to me. @PERSON1. I had never in my life heard of anyone named @PERSON1 before. Luckily, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom as her. And even as a month passed, I still felt uncomfortable being near her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday soon began to creep up after the first month at @LOCATION1. I was beginning to find out which people I wanted to be friends with, and which people to avoid. Unfortunately, even the people I had gradually grown weary of, had to be invited to my birthday party because it was a class party and I didn't want anyone to be left out and since the class only had thirty people in it, I could only deduce that word about the party would spread around and people would begin to talk. I knew that I hadn't built up enough of a reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality was actually like. As, I was putting an invitation in everyone's beige, square cubby, I hesitated when I came across ""#@NUM2"". This was her number. The number of that girl with the bizarre name that I had an undeserved, grudge-like suspicion of. I cursed myself violently after I put that birthday party invitation into her cubby. When the day for the party finally rolled around, I had everything set up just how I imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS2 @CAPS3 cake picked out for myself. The guests began to arrive knocking at the glass door, temporarily staining it little grimy knuckle prints. @PERSON1 came alone. As I opened the door, she timidly and immediately shoved a gift at me and shyly muttered under her breath ""@CAPS4 birthday @CAPS5"". I welcomed her traditionally, as I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party continued to go in several directions until my mom gathered everyone around, so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON1 stepped up next to me. With a confused expression on my face, my mom leaned down to whisper that @PERSON1 had the same birthday as me and she would blow out the candles with me. I couldn't believe it. The person who I had selfishly pretended to not exist, was the person who I had to share my cake with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left because the party ended and I silently pouted for having to share my birthday with another person. After the party, I walked into the house, only to find @PERSON1 sitting on my steps. Her mom apparently couldn't pick her up for another hour. I came over to her and casually started making small talk with her. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a huge glob of frosting in his hand. He yelled @CAPS4 birthday to me and threw it at my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his room as I continued to stand there with my mouth gaping. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON1 giggling. And without warning I started laughing too. And neither one of us could stop. It was at that moment when I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing, and by the time her mom came, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we were unsuccessful, I had grown to understand that this girl was someone I wanted to get close to. @PERSON1, through that first laugh, became my best friend and continues to be my best and closest friend today.",23.0,20.0,,43.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,":** The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

21099,8," My best friend @PERSON2 and I have a tradition that we made up. Every time she comes over to my house we always slide down the stairs in a sleeping bag. We came up with @TIME1 @CAPS4 she was spending the @TIME1 at my house. While sitting on the staircase with nothing to do it suddenly hit me. I turned to @PERSON2 and said""@CAPS1 could two little girls possibly do to have fun in the middle of the @TIME1, @CAPS4 all they have to work with is a long staircase that has been sitting right under their noses the whole time?"" and to @TIME1 she says ""I'm listening."" @CAPS2 we were both getting excited because we finally found something fun to do.I said ""I'll show you. We just need to get all the pillows we can find."" The two of us scampered around the house looking in every room and brought all the pillows we could find back to the staircase.""@CAPS3 @CAPS1 do we need all these pillows for?"" @PERSON2 asked and was surprised @CAPS4 i said ""for padding."" @CAPS4 the pillows were set up at the foot of the stairs, I told her of my brilliant plan. She loved it! We couldn't wait to get started. ""@CAPS5 purple sleeping bag will be perfect for @TIME1"" said @PERSON2.  I ran down the hallway to my room, snatched my sleeping bag, and sprinted back towards the staircase. My purple sleeping bag is super slick and was just the thing we needed to glide down the stairs.  @CAPS2, @DATE1, we are fourteen and fifteen @DATE1 old, we still have fun doing @TIME1. Over the @DATE1 we have improved it, making it nerve racking and loads more fun. @PERSON2 and I have agreed on some safety precautions, which we thought were necessary. @CAPS4 we are just using the sleeping bag we don't need them, but as we have added on to that we have agreed to wear a helmet and sometimes add a few pillows. The helmet kind of scares my mom because it's even needed. One @TIME1, while my parents were out, @PERSON2 and I had been eating way too much sugar and were extremely hyper. The two of us were sliding down the stairs but it was starting to get too easy,and wasn't as much fun as it was @CAPS4 we were about @DATE1 @DATE1 old. We wanted to make it even bigger and better than ever before! We started brainstorming. My brothers room was upstairs and we somehow wanted to incorporate his mattress into our fun. @PERSON2 and I dragged the mattress out onto the staircase. We both sat down on the mattress, pushed off, and went shooting down the stairs. We could barely keep a hold of the mattress. The farther we went down the staircase, the farther we slid off of the mattress. We were laughing @CAPS3 hard @CAPS4 we got to the bottom, we almost slammed into the wall! It was @CAPS3 much fun. After that first ride we decided we had better put an extra pillow up on the wall somehow. One thing we hadn't thought about before we went crashing down the stairs, was how heavy the mattress was. It was very hard to get back up the stairs, but we didn't mind because we were having @CAPS3 much fun.  @PERSON2 and I were getting tired @CAPS3 we decided to take a break. The two of us hauled the mattress up the stairs , it one last time before plopping down on the couch in the opposite room. Not too long ago my mom had bought an inflatable exercise bean. Shaped just like a real bean and had handles on both sides. @PERSON2 started messing around with it, and @CAPS4 she said ""@CAPS6 try it?""We both rushed back to the stairs, ready to have some more of the reckless fun that we love. Our imaginations were bouncing off the walls. @TIME1 time the two of us felt it was time to mix everything together for the ultimate ride. We kept the mattress on the top of the stairs and measured out just where we needed my sleeping bag to be. Our idea was to be sitting on the exercise bean, on top of the mattress, slide down off the mattress, land on the sleeping bag waiting on the stairs to give us a turbo boost, and finally be sent flying into the pillows at the bottom of the staircase. I found some duct tape @CAPS3 the @PERSON2 could tape the sleeping bag to the floor.  @PERSON2 let me go first. I was nervous because we'd never done @TIME1 before. After a minute a finally pushed off. It was a bigger drop from the mattress to the stairs than I thought it would be. @CAPS4 I landed on the sleeping bag it was like being inside of the @PERSON1 video game, and hitting the turbo boost. It was scary but @CAPS4 I got to the bottom the two of us were laughing uncontrollably. We had @CAPS3 much fun.   ",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,3,,":**

21101,8,"                                                   THE @CAPS1  A couple of weekends ago me and my cusin were at my grandmas house. She lives up in the woods and has a bunch of quads and motorcycles. All me and my cusin did was ride,have airsoft gun wars, and build giant forts. We planned on only staying one night but ended up staying three.   So the first night we were there we built a fort out in the woods. The fort seemed really good at the time, but the next morning we had other ideas. So the next morning we were getting ready to go outside and work on the fort. He got done before me so he went down there first. By the time I got half way down there I heard him scream and come running out of the fort. He was yelling @CAPS2 .....MICCCCEEEEE! So i figued we must have a little @CAPS2 problem and laughed to myself. So I walked in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little @CAPS2 running around in there. That was the end of forts on the ground for us.  The next day we decided to have airsoft wars(guns that shoot little plastic bb's). We were having alot of fun shooting eachother mainly because it hurt. Like I said we were having alot of fun until I decided to try and hid up in a little tree. He found me and shot me I fell out of the tree and broke my gun. That was the end of the wars plus I almost broke my leg. I guess that was payback for laughing about the mouse thing.  After the wars ending we decided to go ride quads for a while. There are alot of trails around her house to ride on. He road a dirtbike and I rode a quad, I road a quad so I could make new trails. We made some really good trails up there. It was really muddy up there and very wet. While we were way out in the woods on a long ride I ran out of gas. So I had to walk all the way back to the house for gas then walk all the was back up there.  The last day we were up there we got up early. We wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort. This time we were going to make a tree fort so we didnt have to worry about critters. We spent from the time we got up till the time we went home on this awsome tree for. My granndpa has alot of wood that he dosn't use because he really to old to build anything so we never ran out of wood.

21105,8," Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter I believe can snatch me out of the awful crater which I hide away in. It creates a bubble of joy in the pit of @CAPS1 stomach, and it finally bursts joy throughout me. Laughter feels like a @DATE1 day hearing the bugs hum with the warm breeze, and knowng I am able to float up into the cotton candy clouds, then not realizing I'm laughing at everything I do. Laughter flips @CAPS1 gloomy days upside down, and makes me realize every reason I have to be happy. Sixth grade is a big mile stone in everyone's @CAPS2. Getting lockers, having more freedom, being able to be around older kids, and so much more. I always had a dream of laughing with @CAPS1 old best friend and giving boys our numbers, except it all changed when she moved away. No one talked to me or hung out with me at school. @CAPS1 old best friend never left @CAPS1 side no matter what, so it was uncomfortable walking thruogh the crammed hallways of a huge school with just air breezing by me.  School became unpleasent to go to everyday for eight hours. Most sixth graders don't like school because of the homework and would rather social with other classmates, but not me. I felt alone when other sixth graders (mainly girls), made jokes about @CAPS1 appearence or how I always got good grades in school. They would steal the projects that I made and worked really hard on. They also took books, papers, and supplies like pencils and pens. I learned new formulas and facts, but never did I learn how to socialize with other peers. Three quarters went by of @CAPS1 sixth grade year and I felt alone like suddenly the rest of the world shriveled up and died, or moved far far away. At night, @CAPS1 eyes would spew gallons of salt water tears down @CAPS1 face splashing @CAPS1 pillows. @PERSON1 was @CAPS1 other best friend and never teased me or talk behind @CAPS1 back, but she stuck to the people who did. It overwhelmed me walking near the group of girls who would put other people down, but hid it with their cartain acts around specific people. They would tell other students rumors about innocent people and how gross and weird they were. I didn't want them telling people rude comments about me, so I ignored them the best I could by doing activities on @CAPS1 own. A girl from the other elementary school noticed @CAPS1 loneliness at school and decided to talk to me. I was shy and felt @CAPS1 stomach starting to do flips which was never a good sign. All I could do before I looked like a scared kitten was smile and nod. She told me that next lunch I should come hang out with her and her friends, but those girls were the girls who teased me. The next lunch I went with her feeling sweaty-hand nervous the entire time. Once I started talking to them about myself they just smiled and said I was adorable and a really awesome person, which made me smile from cheek to cheek. It felt good to smile for the first time in a long time. A couple of days later, the girls told other sixth graders I was a goody two-shoes that is so dreadfully boring. @CAPS1 smile faded quickly once I heard those rumors that spread through @CAPS1 class like a disease. @PERSON1 left the group of girls one day at lunch to talk to me about what had happened. I told her how I felt about what those girls did to me and how it felt like the world always would agree with whatever they said. She confessed to me that she truly didn't know why she was hanging out with them in the first place. I was relieved to hear her say those words and for her to not agree with what that group was saying about me.  The girls who talked bad about me behind @CAPS1 back were left to do whatever they desired, while @PERSON1 filled the breezy air by @CAPS1 side with laughter. Together we laughed at everything that amused us. Sometimes we would even laugh at each other during boring assemblies or at a ridiculous person attempting an act that everyone knows they cannot do. When she had a bump in the road in @CAPS2 I supported her and did what a true friend would and just laughed at how dumb the other person was being just to make her laugh at the situation. In other words laughter pulled me out of @CAPS1 awful pit I hid away in and made me find @CAPS1 true friends in @CAPS2. Laughing has made me forget bad times and people, and has made me realize when they bring me down I have a million reasons to laugh until I have to gasp for a sip of air. Laughter has been a huge part of any relationship for me because I can have an enjoyable time.  ",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21106,8,"Water @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 we think that laughter is just an emotion, but in all actuality it's practically a way of life. We use laughter to cheer people up, or get out of trouble. People do stupid things just to make others laugh. I personally think laughter is a reason to live, and that every one needs more of it in their daily lives. I have always been the type to make every one laugh and feel better, and I would always put myself in pain just to cheer someone else up. When I was a child my friend would always be picked on at school, for no reason really. And I wasn't the type to take action, or try and get back at someone. But that all changed when my friend came home covered with food crying before school was even let out. She told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names. So the next day I went to school with her in the morning and I took @CAPS1 filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks and soured milk. When she pointed the girls out to me I grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them and it hit her in the chest. She started screaming that her clothes were designer, like someone would actually care. I looked at my friends face, she was awe shock, but I could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew I was not yet finished. I then threw one with egg yolks in it and got in a girls hair, her scream was earsplitting. The smoothie filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe (or trying to use each other as a shield) but it wouldn't work with my throws. They started to freak out and run to the others, which was a bad idea because they were all hudled together trying to figure out who it was. By the time they figured it out it was too late, I was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. It landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown. It covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about.  I could see everyone of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me, they started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. Some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while. I looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears. She ran over and hugged me so tightly I thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me. It's been ten years since then and I still talk to my friend, she even occasionally calls me if she's having trouble with someone at school. As for the girls? I haven't heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools. I guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives, and helps people become closer then ever before. My friend still says that it was the best day of her life. Some of the other kids who witnessed the event go to high school with her now, and all ask how I am and want to see me do something like it again. Unfortunately I had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves. I imagine that some of them have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what I did.",22.0,18.0,,40.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The writing is clear and focused.

21107,8," Laughter is an essential component to any relationship, as it can erase any previous uneasy feelings and has a tendency to bring two people together. This phenomenon stays true whether the individuals involved are in the same room, talking over the telephone, or even communicating over the internet. My best friend and I share a special bond in which laughing has played a large role in keeping us together.  Laughter can keep people together even in times of hardship. My best friend, @LOCATION1, is @CAPS1, and we have shared many laughs over the @DATE1 years we have been friends. We first met while playing an online computer game and immediately enjoyed each others comments and comical statements. We would immediately burst into laughter when one of us would say something that could be considered even the slightest bit funny. He and I shared many laughs over the next two and a half years. Recently his family had financial troubles and was not able to pay the internet and phone bills for several months. Work during this time seemed to be more of a burden than usual, as I had few people I could truly relax and have a laugh. Only the occasional laugh with my friends who live locally could cause me to forget the disappointment I had from missing one of my greatest friends. @DATE1 weeks ago there seemed to be some hope that my best friend and I would be again able to communicate as before. While staying up @TIME1 one @TIME1 doing homework, I noticed that I had received a message from the long-lost @LOCATION1. I immediately chuckled inside, thinking of the good times we had shared just a month earlier. To my disappointment, the message which I received was not to tell me that he had internet at his house once again, but to thank me for the @CAPS2 gift and to tell me he was at another friends house for the @TIME1. He also mentioned that he would enjoy playing a game or two with me during this time. While this provided some comfort, it did not fully satisfy my hunger for laughter because his computer which he had taken with him was missing the drivers which allowed the use of a microphone. That afternoon, though somewhat disappointing, reminded me of the many great times we had shared together. One @DATE1 ago, my hopes were finally confirmed when @LOCATION1 messaged me to tell me that he had internet again. Though we had missed being together during the @DATE1 break, we were thrilled to once again be able to communicate. I am glad the @TIME1 he chose to get internet was a @DATE2, because we played and laughed till @TIME1. The laughter which we shared that @TIME1 washed the disappointment far from both our minds. My days are once again complete, as they are now an almost perfect balance of work and laughter. Laughter truly does bring people together, far more than I had previously realized. Though my best friend and I are thousands of miles apart, when we talk and laugh together, it seems as though he is in the same room with me. I hope that some day soon we @MONTH1 be able to actually be in the same room, sharing laughs and enjoying life. This example is just one of the many where laughter has greatly improved the outcome of a particular situation, making the individuals involved even closer together than they had been before.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

21109,8,"  Laughter is a important part of my life.The best way to pass the time is laughing with friends and family. Think back on all the fun times you've had, if you do you'll find that most of them you are laughing. That's because laughter and fun go hand in hand. Everyone likes to have fun, therefor everyone likes to laugh. Laughing is good for you in many ways, it keeps you happy, helps maintain healthy relationships with others, and it relieves stress.  Also a lot of people laugh when there nervous, I'm one of these people. Especially when you're put in a awkward situation. Like when you have to do a speech in front of the class. I remember my first speech in high school, it's one of the scariest things I've done. It was @CAPS1 year and I slouched down in my chair and tried to get as low as possible so the teacher couldn't see me. I wouldn't make any eye contact with her either. I put my back pack in front of me in order to block her view. Every time she'd look around the room to pick another person to go I'd hold my breath and hope it wasn't me. Every time it wasn't me I would breath out in relief.  Finally it was getting down to a few people and I knew my doom would soon await me. I decided to take a chance and peek over my back pack to see who the teacher was looking at for her next victim. What I saw when I looked at her was her eyes meet mine. I tried to hind behind my back pack again but it was to late. She had already started to call my name out.  What should I do? I thought to myself. Should I tell her I'm not ready? Should I try to get out of it? I wiped my sweaty palms on my blue jeans.Then I stood up and started to walk toward the front of the room. I could feel a nervous knot building up in my stomach. With note card in hand, I began to speak. My words were quiet and shaky. My speech was about uniforms in school and if I agreed with them or not. As I went on I could feel myself start to trip over my words. Then I started to laugh, which I always do when I'm nervous. I could hear other people in the room start to snicker. I smiled and looked down at my note card and continued my speech. After wards I felt a big relief to get it over with. It wasn't perfect but laughing at myself when I messed up helped me get through it without falling apart from my nervous.  Although not everyone reacts this way, laughing can help relieve tension in some situations.But always be careful not to laugh in situations were it's not appropriate. It's not good for you to have constant stress. Finding things to laugh about can be a good way to relieve stress. Laughing might not be the right behavior to get a A on your speech but it did help me keep it together to make it through. Laughter is important to everyone. It's a good way to have fun with others and it keeps you happy. Laughing is a good way to relieve stress. Your relationships will grow stronger if you find things in common to laugh about. If you learn to laugh you're sure to have a fun and happy life, I know I do. ",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21110,8," Laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. We're all born with the ability to laugh. Laughter and being able to laugh has been with us since the beginning so we don't really think about how important laughing can be. It gives us a sense of relief, a feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like background or language. I think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them together. When you meet with someone you haven't seen in a long time or you have to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laughter can break the ice and bring you closer. I want to tell of a time when I visited my family in @LOCATION2 who I hadn't seen since I was two years old.   My brother and I were the only ones visiting from our family. So we didn't get to have our mom there to make us feel comfortable, or introduce people. I was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 because although I can understand and speak in @CAPS1, I'm not fluent. Being able to bond with the part of my family I never knew was very important to me and I was afraid that language would prevent that. I was also concerned for my brother because he can't speak @CAPS1 very well at all. While on the plane I contemplated how I should introduce myself, topics to talk about, and prepare answers for certain questions. I didn't want the language barrier to cause an awkward atmosphere.   Finally it was time to arrive in @LOCATION2. We landed in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 where a lot of my relatives live. My brother and I collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts. We saw them waiting for us and @CAPS3 waved enthusiastically. Then naturally we responded with the same enthusiastic feeling. As we met them for the first time we exchanged hugs and phrases like ""I'm happy to meet you."" @CAPS3 were very kind to us and welcoming, but it still didn't feel like I was meeting my family. Things were very different and new for us. It was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag.   The first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in @LOCATION1. It was pretty awkward. Communicating with elder relatives who can't speak @CAPS4 was a lot harder then I had thought. The first night passed as I slept in the uncomfortable humidity. The next morning our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. I was excited to meet more of my family so soon, but until then we had to pass the time exploring our new surroundings. My brother and I checked out the house and walked up and down the streets. Immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. We had a lot of fun embracing the fact that we were in a different country we have been familiar with, but never really known.   At last it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives. We drove into the downtown area of @ORGANIZATION1 and met up in a restaurant that overlooked the ocean, as @ORGANIZATION1 is right on the coast. I related to my cousins more because @CAPS3 were younger, in @CAPS3're mid twenty, and generally I can get along easier with young people. We gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in an area sectioned off for more privacy. As we were ordering our food and admiring the scenery from the window, I felt more at ease. Our food came and we started to eat. While we were eating, my cousin started cracking jokes which made everyone laugh. My brother and I were laughing so hard we teared up. During the whole dinner there was laughter and smiles. At that time I really began to feel like @CAPS3 were my family. I was really thankful for my cousin who started the laughter, because with out all the laughing I don't think we would have bonded so quickly.That was the time I felt that laughter is very important and brought me closer with the people I love.",23.0,22.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

21111,8," Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON2 sr. theres always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you dont experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON3 decided to make it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, of course she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised to eachother that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care for eachother. We had arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning, we were all a little tired, but for the most part we were all hungry for sure, that is why coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 so that we could buy some snacks. He, of course, ran straight to the @CAPS2.Pepper That old man always had to have one of those with him no matter what. Being a cross country coach and all, he wasn't a very good influence over his athletes. Anyway, if you are a @LOCATION3 fan you either know, or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @CAPS2.Pepper! oh man, god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @PERSON2 all jittery and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea, we were going to take his @CAPS2. Pepper, and drink it! ok maybe not drink it, but we were for sure going to take the pop from the old man. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We arrived at the hotel and coach told us to upack our stuffso that we could tour the place a bit. So while coach was getting our room keys, we decided that we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @PERSON1 and I took all of his @CAPS2.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing ever happened. We got our keys and he told us that he would stay down and unpack the rest of the things, we didnt want him to do that because he would then realize that we had took his pop, so we immedietly ran to the rooms and threw everything on the floor so that we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we would go straight to exoeriencing another one of those @LOCATION3 tours. It wasn't 'till the night time that we arrived back to the hotel and @PERSON2 hadn't said a single word about his @CAPS2.Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever! it was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought that was kind of lame because none of us girls we tired, not even @PERSON3, and she raced in the morning. She was the rebel one out of all of us by the way. Tme passed and we were all still awake, we were absolutely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided that we would unpack @PERSON2's pop. We starred them down as if they were some prized possesion or something. We thought about drinking them, but that would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave, therefore, we just decided to hit the sheets and get some shut eye because the morning was going to be big for us girls and coach. It was the morning that the second biggest race of @PERSON3's life was going to take place, and ... we were still in bed! of course @PERSON2 got up before everyone. We were awakened by a loud knock, we figured it would be @PERSON2 because who else would it be. We opened the door and big old bald man was standing there and said "" i'm only going to say this once"". I need my @CAPS2.Pepper. It was so funny we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because old bald man was turning beet red, apparently he didn't find it funny. We kind of sorta in a way found that out when he pulled the @PERSON3 not racing card, we were terrified for our lives!, especially @PERSON3, since she was the one that was going to be racing. We played the dumb people for about five minutes until he actually was being serious, then we decided to play the nice guys. Yes, we gave him back his @CAPS2.Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day, ""messing with @PERSON2 is like messing with a pig, you're both going to get messy, but the pig likes it""",18.0,18.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

It started out like it always did nobody really wanted to go first, but @CAPS7 sombody finly maned up and just went. @CAPS7 it got started. After that everbody was @CAPS4 and having a good time.

We had seen all of his faces and herd all of his noises so it wasnt going to work. @CAPS7 after he realised that we wernt going to laugh he started telling us a story. He started the story out by saying ""@CAPS6 this guy right; he didnt have anything besides his chair and his box. He loved his chair and his box."" The story wasnt very funny yet but he went with it. ""@CAPS7 the guy went to bed because he was tired and all, and @CAPS8 he woke up his stuff was gone. His chair and his box the only two things that he had in this world were gone. So he went looking for his things. He was searching all day and night but he couldnt find anything not his chair, his box, or even a clue of where they could have gone. So he disides to go to bed and maybe they would be back in the morning like maybe it was all a dream; but @CAPS8 he woke up he had turned into a wild boar."" @CAPS8 he said that @PERSON2 started running around acting like a pig. That got us @CAPS4 but he didnt want to stop there he just kept telling his story. In the story it turnd out that everytime the ""guy"" went to bed something strange would change and it just got more and more funny. My family loves to laugh and have others laugh with us.

I asked him trying that puppy dog face my sister always makes to get what she wants.Only if @CAPS2 stop making that weird face at me, do @CAPS2 want to drive? He asked me as we walked out the door to go pick up @PERSON1.Yes please, I said as he flipped me the keys.Pulling into @PERSON1's drive way i shut off the truck and stuffing the keys into my left front pocket i walked into @PERSON1's house. Walking into it i knocked on the wall and two heads turned to look up at me. One my best friend @PERSON3 a sandy short hair boy with a white face and the other was the birthday boy @PERSON1 who much like @PERSON3 had the same hair color but had pink rose cheeks.

21114,8," Have you ever been laughing at something that someone said, and then began laughing harder at, not the joke, but at a person whose laugh was almost more humorous than the joke itself? Then were you put into a good mood after the funny laughing occurred, when just before that you could have been in the world's worst mood? Laughter is the cure for almost anything from being in a bad mood to crying because you're sad. It can also help make the mood in the room brighter or simply it makes any awkward moment disappear. One bright @DATE1 day, @PERSON1 called me and asked if I wanted to long board down to @PERSON2's and get some lunch with her. Of course I wanted to because I'm always up for my typical @PERSON2's order of a chocolate malt milkshake and some croutons and ranch. I jogged to her house down the block and we long boarded down to @PERSON2's in downtown @CAPS1. On the way to @PERSON2's I shared with @PERSON1 how I had not had a good day so far and how I needed to be cheered up. She was feeling the same way. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's we were both excited to get seated so we could catch up with each others lives and eat. When we walked inside we noticed how crowded it seemed to be that day as we waited for a table. After getting seated we noticed an older couple sitting in the booth behind us, some kids from our school in the booth front of us, and a man and women across the aisle. @PERSON1 ordered a strawberry milkshake and a burger with fries, and I ordered my usual. After the lady took our order and left, @PERSON1 and I started telling each other the reasons for our bad moods. She was in a bad mood because her friend @PERSON3 was not treating her right. I was in a bad mood because my friend @CAPS2 was mad at me for something that never happened.  We were both quite upset and frankly we were in no laughing mood. When all of a sudden we heard what sounded like a mixture of a goose's honking and a donkey's braying. We turned around to find it was a lady's laughter. I looked at @LOCATION1 and she looked at me and we started busting up laughing. This went on for about @NUM1 minutes straight. We both could not believe a sound like that could come out of any human being's mouth and it was probably the loudest laugh I've ever heard. We also loved the fact that all of this is happening at a public place with all these people around, and the lady was just setting herself up for being made fun of. @PERSON1 and I continued to laugh at the lady for how she was laughing and it somehow started to relieve our bad moods. @PERSON1 started smiling a little more and as for me, I couldn't stop smiling and laughing.   Laughter has an unusual way of putting people in a good mood or relieving them of their bad moods. Regardless if the laugh is a normal little chuckle or an unnatural sound coming out of someone's mouth, laughter brings people together and it's great way to turn a awkward moment into a memorable moment. Someone once said, ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and that person knew what they were talking about.",20.0,19.0,40.0,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21115,8," There are many reasons why laughter is an important part of any relationship. In my opinion you can no be serious about everything. Laughing is a way of lettting yourself go and relieve stress. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. Laughter can help in many more ways then that.  Being serious about everything is not always a good thing. You need to have fun in your life to keep you happy. Being around people that make you laugh is always a good way to put yourself into a good mood. Laughing is a good way to take the pressure off and not be ebarressed. Being able to have a realtionship with people where you can laugh at things when they are funny is always needed. For me i know that being around people who cant laugh things off i always feel like i need to watch what i say. Laughing is one of the best way to just relax. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. If i do not feel like i can joke around and laugh with the people that i am with i usually do not feel like i can be myself. Altough if you are not comfortable with the people that you are with to start with then it might be harder for you to joke around with them. Eventually if you let yourself go and laugh you will feel closer to them. Being happy and laughing with people makes a really strong connection between people. Making things into a joke is a way alot of people keep their selfs from getting embarssed. Usually if you do something that other people think is funny and you dont, then if people laugh you might feel uncomfotable. But if you start to laugh with them it takes the pressure off you and they are not longer laughing at you but now with you.  In conclusion there are many things that laughing can do for you. It makes it so you dont have to be serious about everything, it takes the pressure off and relieves stress. Laughing is one of the best things that people can do together to make a connection. No matter what laughing can always put someone in a better mood.",17.0,15.0,,32.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay provides a clear main idea and supporting details.

21116,8," What is one of the most important parts of a relationship? Laughter would be one of the most important part of a relationship in my mind. Such as my relationship with @PERSON1, and @ORGANIZATION1. We are always laughing almost every moment we are together someones is always making a joke. But when we are all together cheering is the funniest for example when our varsity cheer squad went to @LOCATION2. We got locked out of our bus then we got kick out of a @ORGANIZATION2. Last but not lest we had the funniest @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, that night we will never be forgotten. When we first arrived at @LOCATION2 our couch left the keys on the bus after we locked it all up. One of the girls noticed when she went out to get her ipod. We all tried to think of some ways out of this. We first tried to put @PERSON1 through the window. But that unfortunately did not work so well because we could not get any of the windows open. Our couch had to call someone to bring us another set of keys.  After the game our cheer squad went to @ORGANIZATION2. Because before the game she promised we could go to get some cookie dough if we were good and didn't complain about having to sit on the stands and cheer. When pulled up to @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 and I ran out of the bus screaming as loud as we could. One of the people who worked at @ORGANIZATION2 said that we could not run in the building. We followed the rules and started doing cartwheels and round offs down the halls instead. We got stopped again and they didn't mean do cartwheels or round offs down the halls either. as we were walking around to find the music box we stumbled onto a baby stroller so we took turns pushing each other in it. Turns out that's not allowed in @ORGANIZATION2 either. We got sent back to our coach. Unfortunate for us we stumbled on to another interesting thing it was a short little dresses on a clothing rack. @PERSON1 and I put them over our cheer uniforms. As @PERSON1 was about to take a picture a girl who worked there came up behind us. @PERSON1 the good friend she is ran off with out telling us. @PERSON1 decides to take the picture instead, after the lady saw what we were doing we got kicked out.  The last crazy event of the night was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. For thous of you who don't know what that is it is simply when a bus stops at a stop light and everyone besides the driver of course gets out and runs around the bus like crazy people. We were just about to leave @LOCATION1 when the light turns red. I was standing by the door waiting for a light to turn red. i had to beg our couch to let us out as soon as she opened the door I ran out as fast as I could. Sadly the the road was all muddy which caused me to fall straight onto my butt. Two other people were behind me and they helped me up and then we ran around the bus. But the light turned green as soon as I rounded the corner. The people behind us were passing and we were getting honked at and not in the good way either. Honestly no body cared we were having so much fun to even think about the other people. As @CAPS7 another girl from the squad rounded the corner she fell straight onto her face. Then when everyone was back on the bus the light turned red again. we waited on the bus for it to turn green. @CAPS7 and I were covered in mud. Everyone one was taking the mud off of @CAPS7 and I then put it on them self's. But since everybody was rubbing the mud it just got really dry and uncomfortable.  In conclusion laughter is an important part of a relationship. With out it our squad wouldn't have half the funny memories we do. That night was just one of the most funniest all of the things that happened that night were just so humorous. Including getting locked out of the bus, getting kicked out of @ORGANIZATION2, and the best of all the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. That night will never be forgotten by me or any of the other people that were there.",17.0,20.0,,37.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,18,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea and purpose.

21118,8," From birth to young adulthood, kids are raised by their guardians or parents. It is the parent's responsibility to convey to their children good morals, life skills, and to teach them how to cope and thrive in society. @CAPS24 parenting children requires being firm and strictly reinforcing rules. The result of this however, is the child leaves their parents prepared to live their adult lives outside the home.It is safe to say that although I am a still a teenager, I have learned quite a lot about raising kids. My knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. Being ""in on"" these small, yet significant bits of history is quite enjoyable for me. I'd have to say that although many of the facts about the ""good old days"" are great, it is the almost tangible memories which my family connects with laughter that are the most significant to me. My @CAPS1 grew up in the @DATE1's living in a small yet average sized house with her @CAPS1, @CAPS3, and four brothers and sisters. The main subject which is the focus of the stories my @CAPS1 retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table. It was her @CAPS5's (my @CAPS6's) goal, for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. It was expected of the @PERSON3 children to practice this by being calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the table for dinner. For an average, fun, causal, and not so dignified @CAPS7 family, that was a lot to ask. Throughout their childhood my @CAPS1 and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table. The only common occurrence that was particularly displeasing to my @CAPS6 was when someone spilled their milk. This fateful event happened almost every night. When milk was spilled it was either the cause of a child engaging in funny business, or it was a result of reaching to far to retrieve the butter dish. Whatever the reason, it was somehow hysterically funny when this occurred. The only catch was, that laughing at the table was frowned upon for it seemed to break the formal mood the family strove for during the evening meal. Laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table. Spilling milk did not continue to happen as often as the children grew up, but that is not to say that is discontinued it's presence at the dinner table completely. One night it was not my @CAPS1 nor any of her siblings that spilled their milk. Instead, it was my @CAPS6. When the initial incident occurred, the whole family was in a state of shock. In effort to clean up the mess everyone donated their napkin, while their @CAPS3 maintained a controlled but disgruntled demeanor. When all was cleaned up, the family went on with their meal and on my @CAPS6's face was a subtle yet unmistakable grin. Years later my @CAPS1 (@PERSON4), @PERSON1, @CAPS15 @CAPS16, @PERSON2, and @PERSON2 @CAPS17 grew up, got married, and some even began families of their own. Most of my @CAPS1's family lives in @LOCATION2 so they enjoyed coming up to visit their @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 (my @CAPS21 and @CAPS6) at the holidays or whenever they were able. During these times when the entire family is able to gather here in @LOCATION1, there is hardly ever a somber or serious moment at the dinner table. As my @CAPS3 would say, ""@CAPS24 we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs.""  I attribute to the fun we have together to this bond of love that connects us all, and I feel it would not be as prominent without the element of laughter. I feel that my @CAPS6 (who is now in heaven with @CAPS21), accomplished the goal of preparing his children for life. Now that they are all grown up, they can let loose, enjoy each others company, and feel free to bust out in laughter even if there is a risk of someone spilling their milk.",22.0,26.0,48.0,48.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,4,,":**

The first thing he dose is make you laugh. Laughing really changes things doesn't it? makes you feel you know comfortable.    Now lets take it back. You show up with guy he says, ""hello"" you sit down and he talks about the most boring subjects, doesn't smile talks kinda of quiet, makes you bring up all the subjects to talk about.Witch couple do you think is more likely to go forward? The first example right? laughing lights up everything smiling makes people happy and it feels comforting.   laughter and smiles i know falls under the same category i mean @CAPS1 you smile your happy. @CAPS1 you laugh you have to smile and usually @CAPS1 your laughing your happy about something or someone. i love @CAPS1 people make me laugh and smile it makes you feel like everything's going to be ok, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 it's not. people don't realize part of communication is smiling and laughter, they kinda ignore and come as kinda, well ya know boring witch makes a person no fun at all. Everyone has to have some joy in there life, and if not there are people out there that can help.  Do you notice gloomy people? People that are sad all the time kind of afraid of life? Maye been through a lot of hard times. Gosh I cant even imagine what some people are going through what some people are going through these days but anyway, smile lightens there heart. Makes them feel just maybe not much but better than they were feeling. just by passing on a face showing that you don't know them but maybe you can feel that there not doing well, or are hurting.   I work at a restaurant in my town here in @LOCATION1 as a waitress. I love my job and i enjoy making people smile and laugh, it makes them feel comfortable. This lady walked in my work and it was a late after noon. She we looking around at all the other customers, but it wasn't the people that were sitting with here sisters or brothers even kids. It was the couples she was looking at she looked very unhappy and it seemed to me that she probably was in a divorcee or break up she just looked very sad. knowing myself all i wanted to do was help her even put a smile on her face because i care. I went over to her table and sat down by here, remember i don't even know this lady. I looked at her and said "" you know everything is going to be alright"" and smiled at her. Within seconds her face lit up it was like the whole restaurant had lit up. She put a smile on her face. You know its the little things in life that make everything ok.

21120,8," When I think of laughter, I think back to the wonder years. Although the memories are foggy, i can still recall the times where I believed friendship had no end and that laughter was the common cure to every battle. Thinking back to the @DATE2 I was twelve, I remember @CAPS7 adventures pushing me upward towards the sky. Free spirited and lacking reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I was @CAPS2 alone though. Through adventures and explorations, I brought @CAPS7 trustworthy opponent. Her name was @PERSON1 and she was @CAPS7 best friend.  @PERSON1 lived out in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land came in acres. Through forests and streams, you could find our hideaway from the world; We called @CAPS3 our wonderland. Now, the small stream with a bridge is nothing but a forgotten place. On a typical @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE3, I drove up to @PERSON2 to @PERSON1's house. Walking in her front door, I automatically smelled fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey. The sweet smell sent shivers up @CAPS7 spine. @PERSON1 came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug. She wore her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress. Her brown, shimmering skin glittered against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes sent me a happy glare. I envied her with @CAPS7 heart and soul. Next to her, i was just the simple, blond girl with a blotchy skin tone. In one moment, she fled to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue ski. ""@CAPS1 wow, finally @DATE2 has come along,"" she whispered and then exploded,"" @CAPS2 another day spent with grumpy, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or annoying teachers. @CAPS6.. its the first day of many!"" We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both new every word of @CAPS3 was true. Sighing, I looked at her breathtaking, dress one last time and ran out to the field in her backyard. @PERSON1 grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she were little red riding hood.  I frolicked through the meadow like I was a radiant fox chasing after its pray. When I stopped for breath, i encountered the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass in rhythmic motions around me. Racing towards our secret place, I looked back only once to to find @PERSON1. As I turned towards @CAPS7 destination again, a branch met @CAPS7 vision and knocked me down painfully. Blood trickled down @CAPS7 chin and left crimson droplets of blood in the green grass. I breathed in, choking on the salty fluid and then realized she was standing there. Like a worried hare, @PERSON1 sprang to @CAPS7 side and helped me to the house. We made our way into the upstairs bathroom.   Standing at her bathroom sink, I wept small tears. In the mirror I could see a belligerent looking girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misted eyes. The pain was @CAPS2 @CAPS4 made me cry; @CAPS3 was @CAPS7 appearance that had me down. People would asked for days ""@CAPS4 is on your face"" and ""@CAPS5! How did that @NUM1 came to @CAPS7 side and squeaked, ""@CAPS6, how are you?""@CAPS7 face turned to a bright shade of red in a way that I might explode. I turned to @PERSON1 and in one fluid breath I burst out, ""@CAPS8! Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I had a boring, simple look going. Now, I will look even worse with this terrible blemish! I hate how gorgeous you are @PERSON1. You are exotic, distinguished and everything about you seems extremely, perfect!""@CAPS7 friend just stood there and took in every word. A confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin. Suddenly, @PERSON1 burst out into laughter. Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave that very second, but she grew silent and look hold of @CAPS7 arm. Shaking her off, I continued down the stairs. ""@CAPS10,"" she called out to me, "" I'm @CAPS2 agreeing with you in anyway. @CAPS6, you @MONTH1 have a small cut across your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I feel like a simple, field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair becomes perfect ringlets and the way your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I have always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!"" I took this in for a second and then erupted into laughter. Racing up the stairs, I came to her with a big, bear hug and laughed some more. Everything I had ever thought about her beauty and mine, wasn't at all relevant. Having thought this, the pain of @CAPS7 cut became apparent to me. Lee, her dad, fixed me up with his sewing skills and each stitch, I laughed along with @PERSON1 to get through the pain. Seven stitches and a nasty scar, remind me everyday that laughter gets you through the worst while @CAPS3 builds an everlasting, friendship.

21122,8," The wind rose and fell, whipping against the side of the house with full force. My mom said she had never seen such a fierce storm before in her life. It shook the house making it creak in odd places, like the floor boards. My @CAPS2 @PERSON1 sat at the kitchen table contemplating, worrying. They had rental houses acres off that were surrounded by trees, the ground was so soft ,so saturated by the rain and flooding that had taken over the valley. There were already hundreds of trees that had come uprooted there were bound to be more. The little homesteads that rested off of @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 including my papa's were well built weathered farm houses,most were surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres of land. You would be surprised to find someone out there with less then @NUM1 acres of land. It's wheat fields mostly, but you can easily find fields of corn, alfalfa, you'll find rows and rows of blueberries so big only @NUM2 can fit on the palm or your hand. It is literally paradise on earth, a small piece of heaven that was thrown down to earth by either accident or purposely. The sun is so bright and the sky is the clearest, most crisp blue. When weather rolls in giant fluffy clouds make the sky look like it's dappled with giant pieces of cotton. All this stretches over land so flat you wonder if it could possibly be real. I have spent so many wonderful , laughter filled summers there. Running bare foot through the fields, playing in the large expansion of lush, green grass. Feeding the goats, chickens, and pigs with my siblings. On @DATE1 my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful turn so ugly in such a short period of time. My mom says if she had known what was going to happen that day she never would have let them get in that car. My papa, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 @PERSON2 pulled out of the driveway. Since it was a small car my @CAPS2 volunteered to ride in the back. The storm had been showing it's vicious temper for over two hours, and it showed no signs of letting up. They had set out to see what damage had been done on their acres of land, to see what needed fixing once this storm moved on over the mountains. There is no explanation, no one understood why my @CAPS3 walked away with not even a scratch on his body. No one knows how the tree fell or why it only landed on the back end of the car, but it did. Gods hand had swept down and caused destruction. My @CAPS2 was killed instantly, my papa was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital, during those weeks the news of the accident spread like wildfire as news does in a small town. Everyone loved my @CAPS2, she was social butterfly that fluttered from person to person , laughing, talking , sharing tears, and joy. She knew everybody, and everybody knew her. The heavens cried and howled that day, rain drops fell so heavily it felt as if the whole world was crying, crying just for you just to share your grief. It's painful, to lose someone so dear to your heart. My papa cried, he sobbed until he had no strength left to feel any emotion at all. he loved her so much, he needed her . Lightning struck the giant oak that stood tall and proud in my papa's backyard that day. It was the same tree that held my grandparents initials. The lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol, sign of how my papa and @CAPS2 had been struck apart quickly and forcefully. But, days before my papa returned home from the hospital, my dad climbed that giant oak and chained the severed part back together. With that my dad had made a symbol of his own, saying you will always be together just not physically, but you will never be truly apart. The day my papa returned home he saw the giant oak, and for the first time in weeks a glimmer of understanding shone in his eyes. A small amount of hope had settled over everything once again. Her funeral was a nice affair, elegant, simple, beautiful, just like her. The whole town came, they reminisced for hours, telling stories about my @CAPS2 and her crazy yet lovable nature. Then from across the room it came. Small at first then growing ever louder. Laughter. A smile, yes there were tears with that laughter, but it was laughter all the same I've never seen the saying "" laughter is the best medicine"" put to justice better. My @CAPS2 was one person who saw laughter, love, faith and hope as necessities in life. She brought joy to so many people, and now they were returning the favor.",25.0,21.0,,46.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The writing is clear and focused.

21123,8," When we were little it was watching @CAPS1. In junior high, it was seeing a kid squirt milk out through his nose. But now as we approach our high school years, we stifle giggles, suppress outbursts, and laugh until we cry, for our own reasons; and we can't hold back the inevitable urge to laugh. Some say laughing is the best medicine, unfortunately for my sister an I, this was not the case; laughing just got us in more trouble. No matter how many times we were lectured, someone always found their way back into the other one's room purely because we were nosy. I remember back a few summers ago, I'd seen @PERSON1, my sister, putting a bag of chocolate under her mattress. There was a possibility it was gone, but I had no doubt in my mind that it was still there. But as the mattress was lifted up and as I was beginning to reach for it, the bed was shoved back down, very nearly smashing my fingers. there stood @PERSON1 with a vindictive look in her eyes and two hands placed on her hips. What could I say? What could I do? A shill scream escaped my lips and I bolted for door before she could unleash her wrath upon me. Up the stairs, around the couch, through the kitchen I ran; but not fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she caught my ponytail and yanked, hard. I was in for a nine year old, hair pulling, all-@CAPS2 beating. But lucky me, no more harm could be done because my @CAPS4 had heard my scream and had come to investigate. Fighting was taboo in our house, but that never stopped us. @CAPS4's punishments were minuscule, we could hug and make up, or stand in the corner. The anger in @LOCATION1's eyes was already gone, and a certain, significant smile played across her lips. @CAPS4 was still trying to play the strict parent, but to us, the passed four minutes were just a joke now.  ""@CAPS3,""she had said, one word, one meaning, that's all it took. We exploded in a roar of giggles and laughter. Although there was no way @CAPS4 could have known this, we meant no disrespect, but be couldn't keep silent. Boisterous laughs rang through the hallway, so loud, @CAPS4's words were inaudible. Grabbing our hands and pulling us towards the living room we were half dragged because we were shaking to hard. Ten feet apart we stood, eyes focused on the ninety degree angle in front of our noses. But one look at each other and sent another tremor of giggles through our little bodies. We could have been inebriated if you didn't now any better, but really we were just two rambunctious kids playing around. We all have our reasons to laugh. Maybe your reason is as simple as reading an e-mail that made laugh so hard you cried. Maybe it is because my amateur writing style is a joke to you, or maybe you too have just witnessed a child's nose spew chocolate milk. We all have things in our life that make us want to roll on the floor, or slap our knees; but from my experience it's excruciatingly hard to hold back, so let it out.",20.0,23.0,,43.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21126,8,"When my friend @PERSON2 and I went to go hang out with our friends from @LOCATION1. We knew how would get there but we didn't know how we were going to get back, but knowing us we didn't care we just wanted to have fun. we had lot's of fun hanging out but then it started getting dark we needed a ride back home. Later on I decited to call my dad to see if he would come and get us. Knowing my dad he thought it was really funny that my friend and I were stuck in @LOCATION1, so he started laughing. After he was still laughing I asked so can you come get us cause its getting ready dark and he said no, cause it's not his fault that I was stuck there. So @PERSON2 said ""why don't I call my dad to see if he would"" and so she did but just like my dad he also started laughing and said no. Later on @PERSON2 and I ran out of people who to call. So we said to each other why don't we worry about his later it's really not that dark and we can all still hang out for a while longer. After i thought that throw I knew we should start worry about because later on it well get even more darker then it already is and then we diffidently wont have a ride home. So I told @PERSON2 that we should keep on trying people while we hang out with our friends more, but she didn't care so much. I made a call to my sister @PERSON1 to see if she would do me the favor of picking us up from @LOCATION1. I called and call her but she wouldn't pick up her phone. An hour past and we still couldn't think of someone, but then I thought to my self maybe my other sister @CAPS1 she always does favors for me, I called her and I asked her if she could and she said yes ill be there in @NUM1 minuets to pick you guys up. So I went to go tell @PERSON2 the great news that I got us a ride home and we don't have to worry about it anymore. When I went back to the park she wasn't there any more I thought she went to the bathroom, so I went to checked the bathroom for her but she was not there also. I thought to my self where could she of gone. I started to get really worried about were she went so I walked around and looked for her. So I looked at my clock and saw that my sister was going to be here in ten minuet, before I realized she was at the store getting food and she didn't tell me. I got really mad at her for not telling me where she went, but I thought to myself it didn't matter so why was I going to make a big deal about it and then I heard someone beep and it was my sister @CAPS1 I got really happy to see her cause all I thought of is going home and sleeping all night and all day. We got in the car and my sister asked why didn't I call my dad for a ride? I told her I did but he didn't want to pick me up because if I could get here then why couldn't get back home. She started laughing at me and thought it was the most funniest thing my dad has ever done. After we dropped of my friend @PERSON2, we went out to eat to burger king and got two salads to go. When I got home my dad asked who brought me and I told him my sister went and got me and took me out to eat. After being stuck in @LOCATION1 so long and not having a way to get I just went to my room and went to bed because it was a very long day for me and my pore little feet. The next morning I didn't wake up until @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My dad thought i need to wake up already so he went it my room and woke me up and told me i need to eat and get fresh air. I woke up and took a shower and eat some food and took a very short walk because my feet were still hurting from yesterday. when I went on my walk I was thinking about how I shouldn't of just gone to @LOCATION1 with out making sure I had a ride back home, but I was very thankful for my sister going out of her way to pick me up and not get mad or even yelled at me. when I got back home I called my sister and told her that I was really thankful for her going to go get me and my friend and even taking me out to eat.",12.0,15.0,,27.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

21127,8,"It was a normal sunny day in the country hill's of @ORGANIZATION1. The sun was out and shineing on the creek that me, my twin brother and my best friend were swimming in. The creek was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim, or they were too young it was just us three that swam in the creek that @DATE1. We loved it. It helped cool us down during the heat of the day. We would play games like @PERSON1, and tag in the water. There was even a rope swing off the little brigde that one of the older kids made. The swimming hole was the place to be that @DATE1.  Eventually we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail we would use to walk back to my house. The trail was the fastest way to get home. From the trail you could see farm animals grazing in the sun filled fields. The day we walked this trail was a little different then normall. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farm hands was walking the trail listening for a bell. He said one of his goats had gotten out. He warned us that the goat was alittle mean and if we saw it to keep our distance. So we took the warning and walked on. Once we reached the gravel road that lead to my house, @PERSON2 said she heard the bell. My brother and I didnt believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked on for about @NUM1 seconds. All of the sudden @PERSON2 screamed run! My brother and i turned around and saw the white goat with big horns chasing us! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped over my feet and fell. I got up as fast i could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was up because I was running really fast and i wasn't getting tired. We reached the hotwire fence that surround my house. We all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to deside weather we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course he made it and soo did @ORGANIZATION2. I was the last one. I started to panic in my head. I backed up alittle and ran and jumped over the fence. I thought i was gonna make it but then my foot caught the fence and i flung over the fence and face planted it. It was super embbarrasing. My friend and brother were both laughing histarically at me. I could tell my face was beat red and i was mad that i fell. Again. Although i still found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns. That made me jump and run. I dived over a row boat were my brother and friend was and I said oh my lanta that was the funniest most scareiest thing i had experianced all @DATE1. We walked up to the house laughing and talking about eachothers faces as we where running and how funny it was that i face planted it. They made fun of the face i made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though i was embarrased that i tripped over the fence, I still found my self laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I would have to say that was the best day all @DATE1. We got up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard that she was crieing. We all asked her what was soo funny and she said she saw the whole thing from the window. We all started laughing to point we all cried. We all told the story the story to our parents when they all came over for dinner and they laughed and laughed. All of our cheeks hurt by the end of @TIME1. Laughing is great. It mends the soul.

21129,8,"       Laughter In A Relationship The most important thing in a relationship is laughter. Laughter is something we all need and it keeps us going with the world and the duties we do all day because we get frustrated a lot of times. So one thing that helps us is laughter. If someone is upset the person might watched a comedy movie or read a comic about funny or humorous characters. But many people like talking to someone when they are upset and need a uplift from them. When I was once upset regarding my school work and about not having a job. I went out for a walk after an argument with my work mother. About my grades being dropped. My mom got quite angry and my dad was also very upset with me because they knew I was much more capable than I showed in my grades. My parents knew I wanted to do a job to buy things what I wanted. They didn't think it appropriate to linger around about having a job so much and not care about my grades.When I was walking along the lake side I heard someone playing a guitar and he played it so beautifully that I wanted to meet that person instantly. I tried to find him but I couldn't and at last I just set down and wondered who that person might be. So suddenly a boy came to me with a guitar and asked me what time is it. I told him the time and asked him where he learn t to play guitar such beautifully. So he told me that he is interested in playing guitar for a long time and he wants to join a band.We both shared our feeling and we couldn't even understand that the things we never told anyone else we were telling each other  @CAPS1 after that meeting we came close friends and we met everyday. He knew I was quite tensed so he used to play guitar for me and we sang songs together. He also told me jokes and I knew he was doing all this just for me and I sometimes just kept quite and didn't respond to his jokes. He got more tensed that I was not laughing or smiling. But I didn't realize that by doing this I was really making him hurt.But he never lost hope in me and he kept on telling me funny stories and we talked over the phone whole night just so that he could make my tensions a bit less and make me laugh. So one day he took me out for lunch at @ORGANIZATION1's because he knew it was my favorite place and I loved going their. He took me to a comedy movie on superheroes but neither of them were making me laugh. All the time I was just in his arms. But after the movies he took me to the most beautiful place and it was near a beach and the whole place was decorated by colorful lights and we were sitting down on a swing and talking. Now he knew how he could make me happy and he told me jokes and we read comic books and surprisingly I started loving his jokes and the comics we read. Whenever I would meet him he would do something special for me and made me laugh. He once got dressed down as clown and tried to juggle balls but he couldn't do it so well and i laughed at him so badly. I know it was being rude to laugh at him but I loved spending time with him.  One day he came to my home and we were talking and he held my hands and proposed me. I was really happy to hear that and he brought me the most beautiful ring ever. He proposed me and took me out for a drive and gave me some advice in a very respectfully manner, not in a intention that he is putting me down. But I had never seen a person like him and he he told me that laughing and smiling is good for life. N o matter what happens tomorrow why should we care about it today when we have such a beautiful life waiting for us. We must live the way we want and not force our selves to change just to get serious in life. He held my hand and took me his arms and said @CAPS2 matter how much we love each other but laughter is important in a relationship I looked at him and asked him why'd? So he replied we'd must be happy and to be healthy and to be with each other. After we had some time there he dropped me home and told me live life because who knows if we will be alive tomorrow. From that moment I realized that he was right and I looked at life from a different perspective from that day and decided to live life in a better way so that I laugh and enjoy.",19.0,17.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21130,8," I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS1 coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were @NUM1 kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was @PERSON1. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored @PERSON1. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @PERSON1 and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, @PERSON1 and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this is the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our ""good byes"". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before. I thought why not? @PERSON1 liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.  Back on the road my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking. and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road.Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by @PERSON1's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto ""where it counts"" we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put and animal near your ""sensitive"" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is let it go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them. Not only because I became a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter.",25.0,20.0,,45.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

21131,8," Laughter is huge part of life. Or so that is what I believe and grew up with. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day."" @CAPS1 quote has greatly influenced my life. As well as the people in my life.  My mother is quite the entertainer. People have told her that she should become a comedian. Apparently our family stories are very amusing. Mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another. He's adventurous, spontaneous, and is not afraid of anything. Sometimes his decisions are not the smartest. A majority of the stories my mom talks about are from when my brother was little. She loves to talk about one in particular.   When my brother was younger he liked to take part in adrenaline based activities. Like extreme rollerblading, biking, and skateboarding. He would try to do every trick in the book and then some. @CAPS1 story, however, does not include him getting hurt or someone else getting hurt. Which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend @CAPS2.  When I was about eight or nine, putting my brother at age eleven or twelve, we were at one of my soccer games. My brother had to use the bathroom and when he came back, my mom was not pleased. He went to use the port-o-potty and he had just gotten two new shirts; a white t-shirt to go under a new button-up. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off his new white t-shirt but kept on the button-up. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt. He dropped it into the rancid, disgusting excrement. If @CAPS4 ask him, it was all an accident and my mom was not happy about it.  My mom is the person in the family who thoroughly enjoys laughter. I think about her words of wisdom all the time, ""@CAPS3 when it seems like nothing can get better, think of the positives in your life and laugh. Because really, that's all @CAPS4 can do. If @CAPS4 embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people @CAPS4 need to laugh it off. If @CAPS4 can laugh about it, it won't matter if anyone else does."" @CAPS4 need to get through life somehow. Might as well make it the best, and laughter is truly the best. It makes my mood better, and makes me feel welcome and at home.    There are many stories about what my brother did, or how blond I am. But ultimately, all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day.""

21133,8,"                       My @CAPS1  @CAPS2 was a warm, @DATE1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. The stars were out and there wasn't a cloud to be seen. As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person, however, could make me laugh for hours straight. That person was my @CAPS1.  My @CAPS1, @PERSON1, came over to hang out with the rest of the family and friends that were at my house. He was talking, laughing, and having a really good time. Of course, I was only about five or six years old at the time; but to me, aside from my dad, my @CAPS1 was the coolest person in the world. That @TIME1, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to all of the adults. All of a sudden, my @CAPS1 came up to me, gave me a big hug and started to talk to me. I was so happy. Since I loved to joke around and laugh, I was thrilled to have all the attention. I used to call them laugh attacks. Anytime my @CAPS1 talked to me, I started laughing and I would laugh so hard that I couldn't stop. That @TIME1, I had one of them. My @CAPS1 and I were joking around and making fun of each other. Then, out of nowhere, I realized that I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. @CAPS2 went on for about an hour straight. That was long after my @CAPS1 left and went back to the adults. My friend, @LOCATION2, sat next to me and tried to get me to stop laughing. She was laughing too, but not as much as me.  Finally, after a long hour or so, I got myself to calm down. The rest of the @TIME1 was great but every so often, I started to laugh again. There was absolutely no way that I was going to stop giggling until I went to bed. After a long @TIME1 of having a good time, everyone left and went home. When my @CAPS1 came to say goodbye to me, I was upset that he was leaving, but I knew that I would see him again. The next day, I was right about being able to stop laughing. I still smiled and hung out with my family, but I wasn't laughing uncontrollably.    My @CAPS1 was and still is a huge part of my life. He is always the person that can make me laugh and forget about all of my worries. Even though I don't live near him anymore, I can still talk to him on the phone and laugh and joke around with him. When I go visit him down in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 seems like we just pick things up where they left off. We don't even think about the fact that we haven't seen each other in a really long time.   When my dad passed away, my @CAPS1 was always there for me. He is the one male figure that I still have in my life. After everything that I've gone through, I could always count on him to brighten the mood and make me laugh, or at least smile. People really do need a person like my @CAPS1 in their lives. @CAPS2 really does help to know that you have someone that loves you and can brighten your day. All you have to do is talk to him. My relationship with my @CAPS1 is very close, and the one thing that kept @CAPS2 that way is all of the laughs that we have shared through the years. Laughter is a huge part of anyone's life. I have grown up around laughter and the thought of always being happy. Throughout my life, I have had to deal with pain, loss, and sadness. However, after everything that I have come through, I can always come out laughing. When I was eleven years old, my dad passed away. At an even younger age, my parents got divorced. No matter how much those things hurt me, I never stopped laughing and moving on with my life.",20.0,15.0,,35.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,5,20,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

21134,8,"                             laughter @CAPS1 funny, normally when i fall of line, for some reason @CAPS1 humorous to me. I'm laughing in my head the hole way down down a rapid.I've taken plenty of beat downs whale I have been kayaking, @CAPS2 i think that my day running the upper stretch of the white salmon might have been my worst beat down yet. I like to call that day the @CAPS5 beat down. @CAPS4 was a very nice day and I felt like @CAPS4 would just be a normal day on the upper white salmon, @CAPS2 oh I was wrong. The bad news started as soon as @PERSON3, @PERSON2 and I parked the car. @PERSON3 had brought the wrong size spray skirt for his creek boat. I had no doubt that we could conquer this problem. the spray skirt ended up barely fitting, @CAPS4 took the strength of all three of us to get @CAPS4 on. After a long hike through an empty creek bed we found our selves at the put in. This is a fairly simple put in, you start off with finding a faltish spot on a @NUM1 foot rock slide. after you find your spot, you simply slide down the rock and of a seven foot drop into water. Unfortunately @CAPS4 wasn't that simple for me, I slid down the rock and of the drop perfectly fine @CAPS2 little did I know I didn't put my spray skirt on all the way so when I dropped into the water about a gallon or so rushed into my boat. I didn't think much about @CAPS4 because @CAPS4 was just a gallon. I actually thought @CAPS4 was kinda funny and that put a good feeling in my gut because that day I was paddling a big boat for my size so I thought @CAPS4 would help my weight distribution a little bit. There for I didn't empty out my boat and we just started paddling down stream.  The first few rapids were no big deal I poked through all the holes there were and I felt like I was doing realitavly good because @CAPS4 had been a while scene I had paddled this stretch. We were about half way through our run when I was starting to realize the magnitude of how gnarly this river was, I was rolling in every rapid I possibly could and laughing my face of every time, @CAPS2 I couldn't quit, there was no way out of this canyon, we had at least @DATE1 foot walls on either side of us, the only way out was down stream! We were nearing the end of our trip and we had @CAPS2 only one more big drop still left to conquer. @CAPS5 falls, a @NUM2 foot drop (depends on who you ask) of pure white water. this drop isn't like any ordanry waterfall in fact this drop isn't really anything like a waterfall, sure you definitely will feel the free fall @CAPS2 the water hydrolics are nothing like a waterfall. What happens on this drop is the canyon gets narrow and when all that water goes over a ledg @CAPS4 creates a hole at the bottom. @CAPS4 is also legged out at the bottom so there's tons of water boiling back up stream, so ounce your stuck in that hole @CAPS1 like trying to paddle up hill and there's basically no way to paddle out of this hole. you just have to hope for the best, hold your breath and stay calm. We were neering @CAPS5 falls and there's only @NUM3 eddies you can catch before the falls so you can scout @CAPS4. Funny enough when I was trying to make the second @PERSON1 my boat got bumped out by @PERSON3's boat and that little bump ended up flipping me upside down and spinning me backwards, at this point there wasn't much I could do about the next few minutes of my life. So I plunged over the falls, I was mixed up in a huge whitewater mess for about a minute and a half, only having brief moments where I could possibly catch a breath of air. I toughed through @CAPS4 and didn't pull my spray skirt because i didn't want to drink from the shoe(don't ask) and because of if I ended up ejecting from my boat there's no way to know what would happen to me in this monster. I powered through @CAPS4, what was only a short minute seemed like a lifetime to me. I ended up getting flushed out down stream and rolling up perfectly unharmed. when I rolled up, I had the biggest smile on my face and my heart was racing. I don't think I would have made @CAPS4 if I didn't have a good attitude coming into this day and having the need to laugh in my head when I messed up. All in all laughing saved my life!

21135,8," I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, @CAPS1 forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially @PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!",17.0,23.0,40.0,40.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21136,8," A moment that laughter made everything better was when I was with my cousin @CAPS1, in @LOCATION1. He is going off to the @CAPS2 pretty soon, so spending time together was the main goal. @CAPS1 and I have a a close bond, we talk as much as we can through the phone. This trip meant a lot to both @CAPS1 and I, we don't know how long it's going to be until we see each other again. Every laughter, and smile was something that we will always remember.  My parents and I went to @LOCATION1 for @CAPS4. In @LOCATION1 I met up with my cousins, since my parents seemed to be busy all the time. Of course when there is a group of teenagers, well it's going to be loud. I remember- on our @DATE1 in @LOCATION1- my cousins and I got lost in the town we stayed. Now let me say in that town there is no way someone can get lost, it's so small. So when we got lost, we found it so funny and unbelievable that we got lost. Fortunately it was during the @DATE1, it wasn't too scary. My cousins and I say it wasn't our fault, we blame the taxi driver for not listening to our directions. Because it was such a funny mess, we didn't stop laughing until we got to our destination. In the car all three of us were argued where to go and what turn to take, while the taxi driver just listened and laughed at us. It was so embarrasing, niether of us wanted to see that taxi driver again. @CAPS1 is older and way more taller than me, he was the tallest person in town. Now @CAPS1 is always talking about how he is not afraid of anything and that he is so brave. Until one night all of that was forgotten while @CAPS1 spent the @TIME1. I shared a room with my two other cousins and @CAPS1 stayed in the room next to ours with my brother. It was about @TIME1, when we all went to bed. Out of nowhere we hear a weird noise outside our room. The next thing I hear is @CAPS1 yelling in the other room, wanting to come sleep with us. I was scared also, so my cousins and I decided to let him come in. I turned on the light while @CAPS1 and my brother were coming inside the room. My brother @PERSON3 came in with all the blankets and pillows, while @CAPS1 came in with the airbed. It was such a funny sight so we all started laughing. @CAPS1 said "" I @MONTH1 be big and tall but I get scared easily"", that made us laugh even more. The noise turned out to be two cats fighting in the street. I remember this moment so clearly in my head since it concluded our entire vacation with each other as family. While my parents and grandparents were out in the front lawn with all the guest. My cousins, @PERSON3 and I were in my room- like always the funny moments happened in my room- we were just bored and didn't know what to do. Slowly I was beginning to fall asleep on top of a suitcase. All of a sudden my cousin @PERSON1 comes up with this crazy idea of how I can fit in a suitcase. I thought she was kidding, but when I looked up to see everyone's face, I knew they were serious. So here I am opening a suitcase, taking everything out meanwhile @CAPS1 goes and gets his camera. The next thing I know I'm getting inside the suitcase. I'm no acrobat, nor am I really flexible, so when I notice that I am having no trouble getting inside the suitcase, I freak out. My brother is practically peeing his pants from laughing so hard, my cousins are just baffled at what they were witnessing. When it came to zipping up the suitcase, I told them that was to far, but they convinced me to zip up the zipper so they could roll me around. @CAPS1, @PERSON1 my brother and my third cousin @PERSON2 all took turns rolling me around. They kept saying on how we should go out in the front lawn and surprise my parents. I came out of the suitcase- I felt so dizzy- after my brother dropped the suitcase on the cement floor. We laughed and made jokes on how tiny I am as well as how much fun it was after I felt a little better. Since then @CAPS1 calls me ""@CAPS13"". Saying goodbye to everyone was hard, but saying goodbye to my cousin @CAPS1 was even harder. Knowing that I won't see him in a long time is unbearable. @CAPS1 and I have a strong bond, and I see him like a brother. In our entire trip, neither of us could speak of him going, instead we chose to just have fun and ignore the pain. Laughing made that pain go away. It made our trip worth going.

21137,8," My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest freinds. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn't allowed and I was certain @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immidiately but instead she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I'd never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the was they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challange authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first expirience with peer pressure and I didn't know quite what to do. But the girls' attutudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn't in the group. That was @PERSON3. @PERSON2' parents had made her invite @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 knew it. They would sit close together so she didn't quite have room, they would look with disintrest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapeted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about one that she'd just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes to me. Sudenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusuasm. @PERSON1 condinuted her story while watching @PERSON3 and me. @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn't have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn't make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME1 when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I'd never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmellows. @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4. @PERSON3 suggested to wish that everyone in america would speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness if more powerful than crulty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer.",19.0,20.0,,39.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21138,8,"                            Closer @CAPS1 @CAPS2  In life, I think that laughter is a very important element. Without it, everything just wouldn't seem as fun. Laughter can be a great thing, or it can be a little hurtful at times. Luckily my story is of great laughter. So, i will be telling a story of one of my adventures of laughter.  It all started one day when me and my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was out and about town, and dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great day because it was a @DATE1. Which meant school only went until eleven o' clock. With mom out and about town, we figured she wouldn't be home until much later. That gave us plenty of time to get everything accomplished.  First thing we usually do when mom's gone is go get our music, and turn it up @CAPS3 loud. Since it was just the two of us home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE1 was a surprise to us though. For it was strange enough to seem as a ""natural high"" day. We felt very positive with high energy. We were practically ready for everything.  With the music so loud while we were cleaning the kitchen, we could barely understand each other talking. Then @CAPS5 awhile when the music stopped, it was just silent rushed cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION1 and I tend to think a lot alike. It is so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of no where, and complete silence, we started to sing. I don't think we realized we were singing the same exact song, at the same exact time.  Once we realized that we were doing the same exact thing, it sort of creeped us out! We thought to ourselves... ""@CAPS4, how can two people ever be so much alike?!"" @CAPS5 that happened, we went on finishing our work. '@CAPS6 this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS2, much like sisters. I'm going to miss her so much when she leaves!",18.0,15.0,,33.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21142,8," Laughter between two people is one of the ways you know if you are really good friends. Laughter between each other is what cheers you up if your having a really bad day. It is the reason you know you have a great bond in your relationship. Laughter is the bond between my two best friends and I. It is why we have been friends for so long. One of my best friends is named @PERSON1 and the other is @PERSON3. I have been friends with them for @NUM1 years now. We are all very close and we do every thing together. We hang out together, we play soccer together, we live close together, and we laugh together. @PERSON1 loves to go camping with her family in the @DATE1. The past @NUM2 years she has taken @PERSON3 and I along. @CAPS2 last trip I had been texting a lot on the trip @CAPS3 i was the only one who had service at the camp site. @PERSON1's mom had yelled at me for texting so much, which had mad me kinda angry. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had agreed with @PERSON1's mom and yelled at me to. I yelled back @CAPS3 I didn't like how @CAPS1 were all ganging up on me. I said ""I know, I'm getting off the phone. Just shut up!"" @CAPS1 were both really surprised that I said that and became intimidated. We all stopped talking and things were really awkward for a little while. Then our friend @PERSON2 who was also on the trip with us had fallen flat on his face while he was trying to do a cartwheel. @PERSON3, @PERSON1 and I all tried not to laugh @CAPS3 we were mad at each other, but we couldn't help it, it was just too funny. So we burst out laughing together and realized that we shouldn't be mad at each other. We knew there was no way that a little fight like that was going to stop us from being friends. We all hugged each other and said ""I'm sorry."" @CAPS2 is why laughter is such a great thing, @CAPS3 there's nothing better than knowing you have friends that are there for you and can always make you laugh even when your mad at them. It can make your bond between each other stronger and can really repair any damage that has broken a relationship.

21143,8," Laughter is the key to every friendship I have. If a person is really nice, but I cannot seem to make them laugh, or vice versa, it is hard to find common ground between us. When I see my friendships and reflect on them, it reminds me of all of the great memories over the years and months that were filled with joyous laughter. The simple things that make me happy in life bring about laughter. Whenever differences become clear in friendships, it only takes a memory brought up that made us laugh, to trigger that friendship back into place.  Whenever I'm with my best friend, @PERSON1, things that normally would not be funny whatsoever, are. Another element that's put in place is the fact that @PERSON1 and I don't hang out as often as we used to, when we went to the same school @DATE1 @DATE1. So, the absence of eachother makes us treasure our times together even more than usual. Three nights ago, I went to dinner with @PERSON1 and her mom at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had numerous amounts of laughing sessions throughout dinner. Everyone who is ever around us, either think we are very annoying because we cannot stop laughing, or understand what it's like to have a best friend that makes your @DATE2 brighter, and think we're funny. There has never been a true fight between @PERSON1 and I because of how close we've become over the @DATE1 and realized how much we are like twins. So conflicts are never really brought up. However, one of my other very close friends, @PERSON2, that goes to my previous school with @PERSON1, has been having problems with @PERSON1. The most important thing to me is that they get along, because they are two of the most important people in my life. I would do anything to make them become friends like they used to be, even though I probably don't have the power to do so. I can get close into both of their hearts and stay on a level of laughter, secrets and wonderful memories. But when they are not getting along with eachother, it's not so easy to bring them together. I had been with @PERSON2 @TIME1, so I knew what she was feeling as well as @PERSON1, who I was with currently. I tried to shortly bring up the subject and at first, she rejected it. I knew that @PERSON2 meant a lot to her, and also that they had only gotten in a small arguement over something silly. The issue was that both of them can be very stubborn, and in any type of arguement, neither will say they are sorry first. It's because they both don't believe they have done anything wrong. In this case, it was a small miscommunication. I ended up going into more detail with @PERSON1 about how @PERSON2 was feeling, because I could completely relate. She later started seeing the other side of things, once I got her laughing. The key to my friendships, is laughter. Especially while we are young. There is no way I could have gotten @PERSON1 to listen to my view on @PERSON2's feelings unless they were what she wanted to hear. So, I told her what she wanted to hear. Things that made her laugh and giggle. Things that brought back memories of the good times her, @PERSON2 and I had had. She thought about it, and even though she wasn't completely ready to full out run up to @PERSON2 and hug her over and over, and make peace, she was ready to consider communicating with @PERSON2 again. That was enough for me to feel good.   The rest of the @TIME2, we put aside the drama and laid back and enjoyed the @TIME2. We played our favorite songs and were cracking up the entire @TIME2 about the tiniest things, or mistakes we made in our speech when we talked to eachother. I know that as I get older, I will look back on my two best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, and realize how they made my high school years so amazing. They brought a better person out of me, someone who can enjoy life to the fullest by being in the right crowd and having innocent fun. They taught me that you can be great friends with more than one person, and even if those two don't get along, you can find a balance and not end up excluding anyone. In the end, the important thing is that you were a good friend to everyone and weren't selfish in the mix. Laughter has brought me to that place. I find that when I'm laughing about sincerely great things, and not making fun of someone or something, I become a lot less selfish and a better friend to people, because my intent is beautiful. I wouldn't get that perspective without true friends that @CAPS3 has given me. By the @DATE2, @PERSON2 calls me and tells me that @PERSON1 called her and asked her to talk. Things will change very soon. ",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,5,,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting. It holds the reader’s attention.

21144,8," Close people to you enjoy the moment you have shared with them and remembering it back brings laughter for what had occurred in that moment. Laughter brings people you have known from a long time together because you have had a feeling for that person and for the moment. Laughing at the memories that were spent with that person and enjoying it can make you closer to that person and it can be important to that relationship. In fact, it has happened to me before; laughter came to me when i saw a special video from my past. It was when one of my favorite cousins was two years old and i was three years old at a family party. My cousin was very chubby and with straight hair, but that day she was very sick from fever. I was very different because i had curly hair and was short. We both had a dress on, but the dresses had different styles. Then everyone at the party was having fun and we were, too. The video got to the part when my cousin and i were bouncing up and down grabbing our dress and making a show for everyone at the party. In that time we were suppose to be dancing. It seemed we were having to much fun that day. Afterward, my youngest brother came close to where we were dancing to see us dance, but he was caring with him a cup of soda. Then one of the grown ups gets up from its chair and bumps into him and he drops his cup of soda which splashed my cousin and me. All of our dress were wet, dirty ,and sticky from the soda. We both stopped dancing and sat down on the ground and started to cry. My aunt and my mom changed us to something else, but later when we saw my brother we were so mad that we didn't answer him when he asked us something or wanted to talk to us for that fact. Later on, we were having fun again and talked to him back again. Finally, the video stopped. It's important that laughter gets people closer to someone because together they're having a great moment while laughing. My cousin and i watching the video remembering our memories made us laugh from what happened to both of us. We have shared the same feelings and the innocent we were at that age. We noticed how much we had changed right now from all the funny times we had enjoyed together. We did realize that it was not my brothers fault for splashing us with soda. Laughing from all the moments we shared helped my cousin and me to be more united. Obviously, in different time in life you react in a different way, but laughing in that moment or later on gets people together. Sometimes in time feelings are different, but laughing is important because you're sharing the moment of happiness with someone. I remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and have some laughter for the happy moments.

21145,8,"I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart. But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and,how they feel about you,@CAPS1 that person makes you laugh you know that they really love you and care about you. @CAPS1 you make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person.Laughter is from the heart and soul. @CAPS1 that person Tell's you something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two. Feelings,@CAPS2, @CAPS3 is a lot between two people. @CAPS3 is from the soul and down deep with in your body. as my mom would say @CAPS3 helps clear the mind and body , but what i really think is that @CAPS1 some one makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. you laugh about all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories, and more. But the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh. @CAPS1 it say it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and, have fun. But my thought about @CAPS3 is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and,then @CAPS4 it is funny then you start @CAPS3 about it. Here is what my mom use to says to everyone is that ""@CAPS4 you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body"". There are times in peoples lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that, i think @CAPS3 is just a feeling that people have. You @MONTH1 tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all. You could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start @CAPS3 because one of them decided that is was to quite and we all needed a laugh. There are sometime you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and, a while. I mean don't everyone need a laugh, I tell my self almost everyday that @CAPS4 I don't laugh then I did not clear my mind or soul. But is it really about me no it is not. @CAPS1 you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really aren't. What you are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean. I have been told funny things over the past few years but im a teenager what do you think i will remember them all. I am just like everyone else I will forget them over the years real easy. I not all that smart but after I think about it for a few min I finally under stand the joke. I know I am a @CAPS5 but I have those days where I am saying what to people what are you talking about, then they look at me and, they just say wow! you really are @CAPS5 and I also have @CAPS5 jokes about me and I really do not mind @CAPS1 people tell @CAPS5 jokes to me. Cause I am not affected at all I got use to it. @CAPS1 I heard my first @CAPS5 joke I had to stop and, think about it for a few mins then after about an hour I realized that they where trying to tell me that it was me.

21146,8,"    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""@CAPS6 and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON1! What is this??"" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flower in your hair"".    From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story.

21147,8," Laughter is a huge part of life, in fact it is all i wanted to see my grandfather @PERSON1, do before his final days. I remember when i was about five years old i loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as i had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, texture, and the over all image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time i was at @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but i can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM1 years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot i wish i got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing, or even camping. Yet there is a lot i did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. When ever i had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how i did, and for some odd reason i got @NUM2 place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, i named him when i was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa @ORGANIZATION1 and I would always go on walks together. My grandpas favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandmas slippers in the bedroom. When i lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, everyday after school i would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until i was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework and cook dinner and then afterwords grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS2 show on. When i was young i would go over to there house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4"". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent i didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I cant take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and i stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I as younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and at his house one time i didn't know what a ""mullet"" was but i knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, i was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE1 job i had on the eastern part of the state, i was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS6"" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had saw him in a long time, which made me happy too. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything had gone, you will notice the best of times are only a laugh away.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21148,8,"                                   Laughter. Laughter is a key thing to have in a relationship. I once knew someone that had a great relationship becuse of laughter. They didnt think that they would still be together if they ddnt have any laughter in their relationship. Laughter is the shortest distance between each other because if you dont see this person, but you can sill laugh with this personand have a great relationship with that other person.  Laughter between these two people laughed all the time and they got closer then ever, even though they didnt see eachother all the time, everyday I knew that there relationship wouldnt be alive anymore if they didnt have there laughter, it means that you are happy with that person.  Laughing with somone that you care about also means that you can trust that person and you are being yourself around that person and you dont have to act how you would normally with someone else that you dont trust! I had a boyfriend that i could laugh with all day everyday and thats what kept our relationship together. We laughed instead of talking because that says how we feel towards each other, and we could just tell that we were happy with each other just by laughing. Sittin on the couch staring at each other in the eyes, then we just started to laugh because we thought of something that we had said that made us bust up and just to laugh like crazy even with out saying any words.  Even though we had our fights we would still laugh at eachother and things that made us laugh that one other said. I would be really upset and sad and he would would just know what to say to make me laugh, then i am happy because i know trhat he ares about me and cares if im happy or sad I am. A real relationship is very hard to find with a guy that can make you laugh when your really upset or mad by just smiling or saying somethings that is goofy. Even though he was mad at me he would still try to make me laugh or smile because thats what i relationship is about. If you cant smile or be happy with that person that you ""love"" then you shouldnt be with that person because you know that you wont be happy and you will always be depressed or just plan old mad at that person. Laughter is a key thing and its something that can bring your relationship closer in many ways. If you laugh with that person and you can be yourself that means that if you break up after if it didnt work then that is probably a good sign that you guys will be great friends after. I believe that laughter is something that makes two people closer and then it also is the shortest distance between two people, if you dont wanna talk like me and my boyfriend do we just sit or stand there and laugh because we knew that we could just laugh at eachother and im sure people that we were weird or something, but we didnt even care so we would just laugh and laugh all day everyday all night long. I think that if you arent even in a relationship and you guys or gals are just great friends like me and my friend @CAPS1 are then you can just laugh at everything that you think is funny and just have a great time, you dont have to be in a relationship with someone to laugh with someone. Laughing is great fort the soal.",16.0,19.0,,35.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21149,8," Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong.",16.0,20.0,,36.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21151,8,"Laughter can create this type of bond that's hard to sever. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the same things. Its an amazing thing when people laugh. It doesn't always make sense or seem that funny at the time but it will make anyone I think feel better no matter what the circumstance. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the somethings. Or how laughter can fix a fight that you and a love one have had. Well here it goes, my story of a very true and very close to home story that help me open my mind and have one of the best and true friends I well ever have in my life. To tell this story i have to go back in time to when i way around nine or so. When I was a young girl my sister, @CAPS1, or as I always called her @PERSON2, and me hated each other. We never got along, maybe that's because of sharing a room with a older sister, but i can remember her never wanting to play with me or hang out with me. My oldest sister @PERSON1 had just gone to collage so my sister @PERSON2 and me got the chance to get to know each other a whole lot more. Sure we still had fights and still didn't get along with each other very well, but we were well on are way to becoming the best friends we are today. Well one day when my parents went out shopping me and my sister @PERSON2 stayed home to clean the house. Well in my family when cleaning music is blasting no matter what kind it is. As always my big sister had to ""order"" me around, or at least that's what it felt like then, and like always i was a stubborn little sister who never liked taking orders from the big sister. Well @PERSON2 told me i had to clean the bathrooms, and I hate to clean bathrooms, I mean who does right? So I tell her that wouldn't do clean them...well that doesn't go over so well with the big sister who is charge while mom and dad are away. So we start to fight, and oh what a fight that was. I mean loud as loud can be. The music couldn't even be heard over the yelling and screaming. Like most fighting in my house goes, my sister and I go so feed up with each other that we stormed out of that room and into our own bedrooms. While the music was still blasting and even could be heard from all the way upstairs. So as I ,and I can only guess my sister was doing the same, was plotting my revenge on my oh so ""wise"" sister then music changed to a upbeat classic song that is one of the most popular songs in my house hold. This song was ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"", because I loved this song so much I opened my door to my bedroom. I guess my sister is like me because she did the same. Well I had started singing and dancing in my room to the music, and guess my sister had heard me because she had come out of her room and into mine. I of course didn't notice her so I had keep doing my singing and dancing. Well as soon as she started to laugh at me I stop and glared at her. @CAPS1 just stands there laughing, I had said something on the lines as well you couldn't do better then that. So she tried and it was my turn to laugh. We ended up making fun of each others dances and laughed all the way down stairs were we hug and said how sorry and stupid we where for fighting. Then after all that had just happened we look around us at the work to still be done. We then looked at each other and laughed and ran to do our work before mom and dad got home. We finish just in time to, as soon as my mom and dad came home we where just doing the last bit of cleaning. @TIME1 after my mom and my dad had gone to bed my sister and I had a @TIME1 of watching movies and laughing our heads off.  That's it, my story of how sisters, or more like best friends can fix and start anything with just laughing and having fun together. Now my sister lives in @LOCATION1 so i don't see her a lot, but when ever i can i web chat her or call her. We spend hours laughing, it doesn't even matter what we are laughing about. That's what laughter does, it creates this bond, a deep connection. My sister and I @MONTH1 have had our fights in the past...and the future but we have laughter that always helps us stay together no matter what happens in life.",15.0,20.0,,35.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21153,8," ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I think that laughter is really important in any part, in any kind of relationship. When people laugh, @CAPS2 get to understand each other better, @CAPS6 usually people think that you are a cool person when you say something funny, @CAPS6 laugh with them when @CAPS2 say funny stuff. It's funner with people who are laughing with you or make you laugh. There were many times throughout my life when many problems were solved by just telling a joke, saying something funny or even remembering fun memories from the past. I have many @CAPS4 that I love, but of course like in any other friendship, we've had little fights between us.  I remember one time when my @CAPS4 @CAPS6 I went to hang out at the mall. Two of my @CAPS4 came into a huge conflict because of something really weird, which later became an argument. Of course we always had little conflicts, but @CAPS7 time I guess the two girls were serious @CAPS6 mad at each other! My other friend @PERSON1 @CAPS6 I were looking at them @CAPS6 didn't know what to do. @CAPS6 my friend @PERSON1 was kind of scared that @CAPS2 might hurt each other. I told them,"" @CAPS1 you guys! Don't be like that!"" @CAPS2 looked at me @CAPS6 stopped. So we started to walk. @CAPS6 I remembered something funny @CAPS6 crazy that those two girls @CAPS6 us did, at a camp the week before @CAPS7 happened, @CAPS6 after that camp I remember how @CAPS2 were saying how we are going to be ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 For @CAPS5"" for our whole life's @CAPS6 that @CAPS2 wouldn't forget how much fun we had. I started to laugh remembering what we did that camp, @CAPS6 @CAPS2 looked at me like I'm weird or something. So I reminded them about all that fun stuff we did, @CAPS6 @CAPS2 looked at each other @CAPS6 started to laugh really hard! Because their conflict had something little to do with that camp, what @CAPS2've had forgotten!  After that @CAPS2 started to talk to each other @CAPS6 forgot about that conflict that @CAPS2 had. Sometimes I remind them about the conflict, but @CAPS2 just laugh @CAPS6 say ""We were so dumb, to make that conflict!"" @CAPS6 we all laugh at them.""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS7 is why I think that laughter is really imported in any friendship. @CAPS6 I think that @CAPS7 problem was solved by just saying some funny memories so @CAPS2 can laugh! @CAPS6 reminding someone a thing that @CAPS2 had forgotten.",17.0,16.0,,33.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

21154,8,"Laughter is a key importance in life, family, and relationships. Gets people through tough times and times when you just need a friend. Laughing is a big part in my life, joking around and having fun, when something happens I try to cover it up with laughter. People @MONTH1 say that laughing is to much in situations, but it gets a lot a people trough tough times. @CAPS1 there was no laughter in the world in would be dull and I feel that people would be without really experience laughing and making jokes.    Making other people laugh gives me good feeling even @CAPS1 it is a lame joke. I think that because it gives me a good feeling about my self, one good thing I know how to do. My family has always been the joking type, messing around and just laughing about everything. There has been a lot of good memories with my family and I, jokes and what not. We enjoy every little laughing matter because its something we each treasure and its a bond that we do not want to loose.One moment in my life where laughter was really great for was in awkward situations with people. My sports team, getting down on ourselves very fast during games and we start to blame other people which is the most common thing that people do when they start to stress in situation like this. Causing so many errors my team mates and I are just not paying to one another and not acting like a team. Just after losing so many games you really start to lose hope for yourself and your team. Our coach always try's to comfort us by saying we did good or we could have tried harder. Some people take this seriously or people do not care and act nothing ever happened and those people start to shut @CAPS2 out and only care for their good friend on the team. One morning before we even started things were tense between people. The captain noticed that two of the team members where talking about her and she confronted them saying ""@CAPS1 your going to talk about me behind my back just say it to me."" @CAPS2 was in complete shock no one knew what to say, so i stated ""well this is just awkward."" The whole team just started to laugh because it loosened @CAPS2, even though it didn't totally solve things it just made the situation a little better.Another moment in my life where laughter was a key part was during road trips. Being suck in the car with my family going somewhere and on the way back from were ever we came back it is a lot of bonding time. You start to talk crazy not making an sense, not being like yourself. Then it bring out the fun of messing around then saying something or do something were it become really funny and its a moment that you don't want lost. An example that happened to me on this experience was going to @LOCATION1 and making up a lot of inside jokes of things we saw or heard. moments like these I always want to treasure because these people in your life right now will not always be their. To create memories do the basic thing and laugh with family. Laugh with your friends.I believe that in some of these situations it could help loosen some of the tension between people, and sometimes make things a little less weird between people. Just being yourself and dont change that. Having so many of these types of moments and much more are special to me, no matter good or bad. they help me remember things easier. Just having the little moments like these are special and it reminds me of how much I really did care about this one person or realize that a moment wasn't a total lost, because it had the thoughts of people laughing and its something that comforts me.

21155,8,"                                              The @CAPS1 Of @DATE2 The warm @DATE2 sun, pools to cool down children, parents joining with friends and family to have picnics and potlucks, and late night slumber parties. Then there's my @DATE2 @CAPS1.The sunshine came in bright throughout the window illuminating the whole room, I awoke to see the bright light of the sun. I ran into my brother @PERSON2's room, to make sure he was up and ready to start the day with me. He clearly was; the early riser himself. We left his room and started to smell the sweet aroma of chocolate chip cookies, we booked it down the hall into the kitchen to talk to mom about what we were going to do that day. When we got there mom turned around to show us her gigantic belly, which was holding my soon to be baby brother, we asked her what we were doing that day. Disappointed at her answer she had nothing planned. My brother and I were bummed but we quickly got dressed and went to the backyard where we were pitching together, the ball hit softly on my nice leather glove while on my brothers it made a slap. My mom came outside and yelled to @PERSON2 to go over to the sliding glass door, for a second I thought I was in trouble for pitching too hard to @PERSON2 but luckily that wasn't the case. My mom then called me over as well to let me know my cousin was coming over. My first thought was great @ORGANIZATION2's coming over! Then I started to think, my cousin @ORGANIZATION2 is weird... she is always making up lies, telling non funny jokes, playing with @PERSON1 @CAPS2 cards, and playing weird stupid video games. I quickly ask my mom when she is coming so I can ready myself, for whatever I am going to have to put up with my mom tells me fifteen minutes. I quickly run past her into my room where my phone is, and call my neighbors @DATE1 and @ORGANIZATION1 to see if I could hang out. Their mom answers and says I can come over there as soon as the girls chores are done, excited I tell my mom I will be at the neighbors house for a little while and @PERSON2 would have to hang with @ORGANIZATION2 while I'm gone. Shes tells me that its alright as long as I leave before @ORGANIZATION2 gets here. I await the phone call telling me that I can go over to their house. Noon is rolling around and they still haven't called, @ORGANIZATION2 will be here soon and I am tired of waiting. I decide to go out front where I can roller-blade around the block, I tell @PERSON2 that I am going outside and he tags alone with me. @PERSON2 and I put on our roller blades and head out of the garage, my mom comes out right as we are about to leave and tells us @ORGANIZATION1 called and we can go over there now, we rush in and quickly try to step up the stairs in the garage to the house. Slipping as we try to shove each other out of the way with the roller blades on, I finally get inside and start unhooking the latches. Get them off and head for the door when all of the sudden I hear a knock just as I reach for the door, it's @ORGANIZATION2. I hurry out the the door saying hello to my cousin as I quickly escape to the neighbors house. I get to @ORGANIZATION1's house and we decide to go outside to play, and run with her new puppy. We play for a little while then decide we should go inside and get a snack we do, then the doorbell rings. @ORGANIZATION1 runs to the door with the puppy at her heels and lets the people in, I turn around from the table to see who it is and see @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON2 standing inside the door. They came over to play too, I let @DATE1 know we should watch a movie. She went over to the movie cabinet and pulled out the brand new @CAPS3 movie!  We all sit down and start to watch the movie each with a bowl of popcorn. We watched almost all of it when the doorbell rang, the puppy bolted to the door and @DATE1 got up to answer it this time my mom stepped inside and told @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 and I that it was time to leave. The puppy was ecstatic to see my mother so she peed all over the linoleum floor. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't notice the dog pee on the floor, so she ran for the door to get her shoes on and she went flying backwards into the dog pee everyone was laughing even @ORGANIZATION2. We said our thank you's and headed back to my house to eat dinner and get @ORGANIZATION2 ready to leave. The most enjoyable moments are with the people you love, they can make you laugh and cry. : @CAPS4.",16.0,20.0,,36.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21156,8," It was a cloudy @DATE1, but nothing to be sad about when among friends. This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together, and they were heading home. I was among this group as a young @CAPS6 who had known this group for three years. Three years before, I was shy, but something changed that. The group was called @ORGANIZATION2. This @ORGANIZATION2 was for teenagers and even some collage students. There were very few of us though. It was our last year as @ORGANIZATION2, then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting at. Together, we made that weekend be are best and last @ORGANIZATION1. The boys were very comfortable around the girls, so much in fact, that they were going to make a deal with us. The deal was that during the car ride, if we rubbed their backs, then they would rub our feet. At @CAPS2 the girls thought this to be a crazy idea, but as time went on, that foot rub seemed really good. Three pairs were made, with a boy and a @CAPS6 in each. The boys sat in the second to last row in the car, and the girls sat in the back. I rubbed @PERSON3's back, but it's okay. Out of all the girls there besides his sister, I know @PERSON3 the best, so I was perfect for the job. This moment was a very giggly time for the girls, and a very relaxed time for the boys. While the boys were falling asleep, the girls were laughing hysterically. Since we had our feet right beside the boys for them to rub, then the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them. This just caused more laughter, and more alert boys.  After we had enough with the foot and back rubs, then we needed to find something new to laugh about to make the time pass faster. It was the @DATE1 before @DATE1, so our @ORGANIZATION2 leader gave us each a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on those candy hearts could entertain us for about an hour and a half. We would pick one randomly out of the bag and hand it to someone. I ended up giving both @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 candy hearts that said, ""@CAPS1"". They were very confused, but again it caused more laughter. @PERSON3 accidentally gave one to @PERSON1 that said, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". Andrew got hearts multiple times that said, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"".  Once that was beginning to become boring, then we found a new way to make the candy hearts entertaining. We would read the heart @CAPS2, then give it to someone saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to @PERSON4 saying it was from @PERSON2 that said, ""@CAPS7 @NUM1 @CAPS4"". Whenever we had one that said, ""@CAPS9"", then we would give it to @PERSON1 saying it was from @LOCATION1. Earlier she had said to him, ""I thought you were @CAPS10 for a moment there"", but numerous people thought she said, ""I thought you were @CAPS9 for a moment there."" @CAPS11, we try to make it up to @PERSON1 for @PERSON2 by giving him ""@CAPS9"" candy hearts.  We ended that @DATE1 with hugs, goodbyes, and laughter of retold inside jokes. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and a few that should have been weren't. The trip ended well, and everyone felt just a little bit closer. We could hug this person @CAPS11, or we could get this person's phone number. Something in us changed that we could be a little closer.  In my experience, I would say that laughter is only one element, because to get laughter you need to love who your laughing with. If I didn't love the people I was in the car with then I would have not laughed with them. They say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I don't believe this is true. I think it's love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown. The statement that laughter is the shortest distance is assuming that laughter is the cause, but in truth, it is the effect. Love is the cause of laughter. If laughter was the cause of love, then this world would be doomed to never know either. Without love, there can be no laughter.

21157,8,"                               Sound @CAPS1  @CAPS2 someone hears something funny, said person begins to laugh. @CAPS2 the funny thing being heard was someone else laughing, the whole room begins to engage in laughter. This has happened to myself many times, but the one time I remember most, was @CAPS2 I began making strange noises. I normally make sound @CAPS1 and such @CAPS2 I'm bored and want to start a conversation, but I had never laughed and made sounds like that before. That moment changed the way I laugh today. The date was @DATE1, it was my birthday, so I decided to have my party at @ORGANIZATION1. I invited my two best friends, @PERSON4 and @PERSON3, to tag along. We love to laugh and just have fun. So, inviting them was a no-brainer.  Immediately, we decided that our favorite water slide in the park was the grand and slightly over sized @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3. It was a large funnel with flashing red and @CAPS15 lights inside. We went on it over, and over, and over again. The adrenaline was pumping through our veins as the ride would end and we'd leaped from the inter tube and rush to the stairs where the waiting line was held. We talked, chatted, sang, yelled, and most likely annoyed every other person in line. Then, @CAPS2 we finally got to the top of the stairs, we became in awe of the lifeguard. But, not because he was gorgeous. He looked as if he was a wee little leprechaun! We stifled a small laugh and got on the ride. @PERSON4 asked him to turn the inter tube around so that she could go down the ride backwards. He then began to talk, and we couldn't help but smirk. He began flirting with us by saying in his manly voice, ""@CAPS4 want me to ride down with @CAPS4 ladies?"" @CAPS2 he said that, @PERSON3 was the first to break. Then me. Then @PERSON4. We couldn't hold it in anymore. He then awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we weren't even paying attention to the ride. Then it hit me.  ""That dude looks like @PERSON1 @PERSON1!!"" I screamed to @PERSON3. @CAPS2 the ride ended, we thought for a second. Then undoubtedly went again. Truth be told, he @CAPS8 look like @PERSON1. We began laughing again throughout the ride, up until I made a strangely abnormal sound. I made a noise that sounded as if a pig had just had it's tail yanked. It was almost a shriek, but more of a squeal. @CAPS6 just happened? @CAPS8 I seriously just...just...@CAPS9?! Note: A best friend will always be there for @CAPS4, especially @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @CAPS8 something embarrassing. It's their job to poke fun at one's strangeness.   So of course, @PERSON4 was the first to say, ""@CAPS6 the heck was that?""  @CAPS7 followed by @PERSON3's expression of, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4 just @CAPS9?"" That's @CAPS2 we began to laugh and then I started making even more unusual noises. I started squealing, snorting, and hiccuping. We were still laughing at my crazy squel @CAPS2 we got off the inter tube.  Later after we had our fill of the @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3, @PERSON4 decided we should go in the wave pool. Of course, @PERSON3 and I agreed. The speaker system in the area started blaring the song ""@CAPS11"" by @PERSON2. @PERSON3 is my go-to-gal @CAPS2 it comes to breaking out in song. She began singing, then we all joined in. But @CAPS2 it got to the chorus, ""I throw my hands up in the air sometimes..."" we all said, ""I throw my banana in the air sometimes...""  ""@CAPS12 my @CAPS13, we should totally make a song of our own."" @PERSON4 said.  We began thinking of different lyrics we could say in our song. At first, we knew exactly @CAPS6 to say to fill in the chorus, then we decided that the song needed more lyrics. That was harder to think up. But, then we decided that we should make the song about food and the way we eat it. We had so much fun. Eventually, we came up with the entire song and people were staring at us as we screamed it to the world. Then, the terible noise arrived again. @PERSON4 began to laugh, then @PERSON3 and I joined in harmony, then a rude interruption by my @CAPS9. @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 continued to laugh at my sound @CAPS1. I joined in with them, laughing at myself.  That night we went to bed, humming the tune of our new song, ""@CAPS14 @CAPS15"" out loud. Now, whenever we hang out, we begin to sing our song, and sometimes, even dance! People still look at us strange, but then we just start laughing, and I start making sound @CAPS1.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21158,8,"                                  How @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only took one @DATE3 to change the whole purose of my @CAPS1. Two things that made my @CAPS1 more than I ever thought @CAPS3 could be; @CAPS4 and one girl. I realized over just one @DATE3 that there is more to @CAPS1 than what we see or hear. Emotions that you can't describe. Something that you have to live out for yourself. Looking back on three months of @CAPS1 changing events, I laugh at how fast my @CAPS1 turned and started heading the right way. Also how one girl can bring me to church and how @CAPS4 can keep a relationship moving strongly. We're part of a movement that will last forever. Her and I moving on the perfect path to eternity with eachother. Have you ever had a person in your @CAPS1 that made you so overwelmingly happy that @CAPS3 caused you to change your @CAPS1 plan forever? I have found some things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth. The first time I ever saw this girl. @CAPS3 was like a instant shock through my body. @CAPS3 felt like I needed her, like something was whispering in my ear,""go get her."" One day talking to my friend about this girl I couldn't get out of my head. I told him how I was going to talk to her @DATE4 and there was nothing that was going to stop me.  @CAPS6 said,""I have a class with her.""  @CAPS6 thought about her and I together; like in a relationship. In a intense thought @CAPS6 looked up at me and said,""actually I think you guys would be perfect together."" @CAPS7 that @CAPS6 said that I said, ""sweet."" I talked to her that day. She was better than I expected. I needed back up though. I had a different friend come with me to talk to her and her friends. I saw her in the hall. So we started to walk over. We got to them and my friend just kept walking. Thinking in my head, ""what a great friend."" @CAPS3 was me alone with seven other girls. Trying to look the best I could look. What @CAPS7 me is I actually pulled @CAPS3 off. She actually thought i was attractive. Was @CAPS3 love at first sight? I don't know you tell me. Getting close to @DATE3. I got my license. Looking forward to what my @DATE3 was going to look like. All was looking really good. Until i found a job at a ice cream factory. Waking up at four in the @TIME1 wasn't the best way to start out my @DATE3. I still wanted to impress her and be with her all @DATE3. I met a guy named @PERSON1. @CAPS6 asked if I wanted to study the bible with him. I knew that @PERSON2 went to the same church. So i wanted to do @CAPS3.  About two months @DATE2 they went to a church thing over in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 was baptized there. Then @DATE2; after they got back. I was baptized. We both had @CAPS4 with us. Love was building up between us. What better to do than date? We started dating on @DATE1. Wonderful moments that I will never forget. That look she gave me like fire burning in her eye's with love. Going to the beach, driving around, fair rides, picking her up and never letting go.  Still with love burning inside of us. I went to her house. Lost track of time and noticed I was going to be late getting home. @CAPS3 was a rainy night. Saying good bye to her parents and giving her a big hug. I ran out the door, got in my truck, and took off. Couldn't see well. A corner popped out of no where. Started slidding across the road. A tree was moving toward me. I hit the tree. In mid flight. Time slowed way down. I thought is this @CAPS3. One picture popped into my head. @CAPS3 was her face. I landed with a big screaming sound. I got out as fast as possible. I came out with cuts and bruises but that was @CAPS3.  I thank @CAPS4 that I survied my crash. I am so lucky I didn't die. main oint is. I think I was put on this earth to be with her and thats what I'm sticking to. @CAPS3's times like these that make you realize how amazing @CAPS1 is. Laughing at @CAPS3 now. How laughter can change your @CAPS1 around. I finally said I love you girl. We are together to this day.",15.0,20.0,,35.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

21159,8," My cousin @PERSON1 and her boyfriend, @PERSON2, had been dating for three years and they had planned a special date for their anniversary. They made reservations at the @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1 and then take a walk on the beach after-wards. For @PERSON1 this was a small step up from an ordinary date but for @PERSON2 this was the biggest day of his life. This late @DATE2 evening was the day he would ask @PERSON1 to be his wife! @PERSON2 pulled up to @PERSON1's house at precisely five-o'clock pm. In his hands he held a bouquet of roses which were handed to the most beautiful girl on the @ORGANIZATION1. She was dressed in a white and pink dress with matching pink heels and her hair was all done up fancy. @PERSON2 was speechless as he handed her the bouquet. After the roses were placed in some water, he escorted her down the steps to his car, @CAPS1 number one. @PERSON2 couldn't start his car. In utter embarrassment @PERSON2 asked @PERSON1 to drive her car to dinner. She giggled and assured him that she didn't mind. When they arrived at @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 they were sad to find that their reservation had been double booked and the other couple had arrived only moments before them. In despair, they set off in search of something else. Everything else that @DATE1 @TIME1 seemed to be full so @PERSON1 decided on @CAPS2's, her favorite restaurant. After a good forty-five minutes of waiting to be seated they were lucky enough to get a window seat. @PERSON2 ordered a burger and fries because he is not a seafood fan. In contrary, @PERSON1 loves seafood so she had a bowl of @CAPS2's world famous clam chowder. When dinner was finished @PERSON2 excused himself to use the restroom before they left but as he was getting up, he knocked over his @ORGANIZATION3 and it spilled all over @PERSON1's new dress, creating a brown, sticky mess. @PERSON1 cleaned up the best she could but there was almost no use. So far so bad, but the worst was still yet to come. When they came to pay the bill @PERSON2 began panicking. He realized that he had left his wallet in his car! @PERSON2's face turned bright red as he watched his girlfriend pay the bill. Good thing we didn't go to the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2! he thought. @PERSON1 was ready to go home but @PERSON2 was determined to propose to her so he begged her to walk on the beach and watch the sun set. She agreed. With @CAPS6 step, @PERSON2's heart began to beat faster, his throat dry, his hands sweat, and his body shake. They sat on the warm sand and talked for ten minutes. Finally @PERSON1 was really ready to go so this was his last chance. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the lone ring. As he got on one knee, the ring fell into the sand. It was getting dark so after a minute or two of frantic searching, he gave up and began to cry. @PERSON1 was so confused and thought he was crying because she wanted to leave but as soon as @PERSON2 calmed himself he told his story and how this was supposed to be the perfect proposal for the perfect girl but it turned out the be the worst @TIME1 of his life. @PERSON1 just laughed which made @PERSON2 think she was mocking him but he continued anyway. ""@PERSON1, will you be my wife?"" @CAPS4 tears of joy she said, ""@CAPS5! As long as @CAPS6 day can be an adventure like tonight."" @CAPS6 time they mention this story they bust out laughing even though it wasn't funny at the time. Ever since then they have had many hilarious and embarrassing stories that they can laugh at now.",21.0,25.0,,46.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay tells a true story in which laughter was an element.

21160,8,"It was another warm muggy @DATE1 @TIME1, when @LOCATION1 my best friend and i decided to go to our friend @PERSON1's house. As soon as we we walked the three mile walk to get to @PERSON1's house @LOCATION1 realizes that he forgot his phone charger at my house. We didn't want to walk all the way back to my house and we had no ride either because none of us have our license yet and and @PERSON1's parents aren't home. So @PERSON1 and i start brainstorm on how to get back to my house to retrieve @LOCATION1's cell phone charger, when suddenly...We heard a loud bang come from the backyard from the old rugged y shed in the back dark corner of the yard; @LOCATION1 and I go to check it out to see what the noise was. we open the shed and one of @PERSON1's dirt bikes had fallen over. @PERSON1 and I pull the dirt bike out of the old spider-web infested shed. @PERSON1 and i both got a light-bulb above our heads and suddenly looked up at each other with the same idea. not being so smart we figure @LOCATION1 can just ride the dirt bike the three mils back to my house on main roads and he will be fine. @PERSON1 tells @PERSON1 about are idea and @PERSON1 says its a bad idea because he mom is not home and he doesn't want us getting in trouble for a phone charger. @PERSON1 repeatedly tells us to put the dirt bikes back, but next thing you know @LOCATION1 has the bike out front testing it out around the neighbor hood. I tell @LOCATION1 ""since there is only one dirt bike you take it and ill follow on the @CAPS1 bike!"" next thing you know me and @PERSON1 are side by side riding a dirt bike and a @CAPS1 bike down the busiest road in town and its pitch black outside. ""@PERSON1 you go and ill meet you there!"" i yell. @PERSON1 takes off down the road at about @NUM1 mph and im about @NUM1 yards behind him. suddenly I see a white figure start to creep out from a driveway, i cant quite make out what it is... When suddenly i see flashing red and blue lights! i try to warn @LOCATION1 and shout ""@PERSON1 @NUM3!!!"" yet he is to far away to hear me but since its pitch black outside the lights light up the whole street, @LOCATION1 tries to loose him by going down a side road but its no match for a charger cop car. It's out of my hands now so I bike back to jeremys house and get him and we run the the scene of the crime to see whats happening. we keep are distance and act like we don't know him. the cop has @PERSON1 in cuffs standing behind the cop car and the cop goes back to his car to write @PERSON1 a ticket and I see @LOCATION1 shadows under the street light throw something into the bush's.. Since it wasn't his dirt bike and he couldn't ride it him the cop calls a tow truck and has him take the bike and the cop gives @LOCATION1 a ride home with @MONEY1 in tickets.. As soon as they leave the scene I go check to see what @LOCATION1 threw in the bush's and it was a can of chew because he is a minor.. so i grab it. the next day @LOCATION1 is home and his parents are at work so I bring him his chew, and he starts to tel us what his mom punished him with when suddenly we heard the garage door start to open; his mom was home from work so i hand him his chew and I run out the backyard and over the fence. he tells me to not tell to many people because he doesn't want everyone knowing but its already the talk of the town...",16.0,18.0,,34.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21161,8," It was a day like any other. I was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder. I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club, but I knew that if I didn't play @CAPS7 best I would lose. I entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there, @CAPS2 was. @CAPS2 had on a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if @CAPS2 had not brushed it in years, his skin was very pale I wondered how @CAPS2 could go out in sun with out some way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @CAPS1 was the clock. the clock had an hour on each side. I walked up to him, @CAPS2 didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS12 guna beat me fast. I know I'm guna lose."" @CAPS2 just sat there, staring at me like I had insulted him. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 scoffed, ""your the kid they think can beat me."" ""I guess. I never really thought about it."" I was unsure as to why that would mater, but I was playing him, @CAPS1 I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon. ""@CAPS4 please take @CAPS12 seat @CAPS1 we can begin the matches!"" the coach called out, ""@CAPS5, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH1 start the white @CAPS4 clocks. No talking."" ""@CAPS1."" I said, ""your name is what."" ""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I hit the clock. Expecting him to be like lightning and move, I moved @CAPS7 piece. Bad move. @CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not @CAPS7 turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons, @CAPS2 didn't even look like @CAPS2 cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS2 set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five. I was already down on time and the game hadn't even really began.  @CAPS8 picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. That was wired @CAPS2 moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved one lousy piece. @CAPS1 I picked up @CAPS7 king's pawn and moved up two squares hopping @CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt @CAPS7 in @CAPS13 game. I hit @CAPS7 clock.  We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @CAPS1 I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked on how the other @CAPS4 were doing. Only one game was done it was @PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know as odd as that was I had to get back to @CAPS7 game.   @CAPS2 still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @CAPS2 was having a problem breathing. @CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird, @CAPS2 just did fools @CAPS10. I didn't think for a minute, I piked up @CAPS7 queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10."" in a loud voice.  @CAPS2 started to laugh, at first I was confused for I beat him.Then @CAPS2 said,""I do @CAPS13 with every one I play for the first time, @CAPS13 opening.""@CAPS2 started to laugh again, @CAPS13 time I joined him we both were laughing because I beat him. Then @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS12 are the first one to see that they could win in the first two."" That surprised me I thought that @CAPS2 won all the time when really @CAPS2 had been giving people games and the didn't know it. We started to laugh again, the coach came over and saw that I won @CAPS2 said good job and walked away. @CAPS8 said, ""@CAPS13 is the start of a new beginning I can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me."" @CAPS2 walked up to the coach and must have told him that @CAPS2 wanted me on board one for now I'm on board one and @CAPS7 new friend, @CAPS8 is there with me on board two.

21163,8," ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many people say that laughter is the key to life. If you can't laugh, then you are not a fun person to be around. Many other people believe that laughter is a very important part of relationships that they are having. In my opinion, I think that laughter is very important also. It lightens the mood in awkward situations, and laughter also just makes you and other people happy. And I personally, would rather be around a happy person, than one that isn't. A few days ago, my mom, sister and I decided to go to the bowling alley in @LOCATION1. We were all three invited to go, along with about @NUM1 other women from the @ORGANIZATION1 we attend. We attend the @ORGANIZATION1. We had all made reservations at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 at @NUM2 @CAPS3.  We arrived first and sat there and waited for about @NUM3 minutes. Then finally we seen some of our friends walking in. We ran over there to greet them and to show them where we were sitting. Our friends started getting their bowling shoes from the counter and then they ventured over towards us. Once all our friends got there, we began to bowl. We had a total of three @CAPS2 for everyone. My mom, sister and I were all three at one lane, and with us was two other friends. The first game we bowled a normal game. As usual, everyone was getting strikes except for me. I was getting pretty discouraged. So our second game around and we all decided to change the rules up a little bit. This round we could not bowl like we normally do. Each time it is our turn we have come up with a new way and new position of sending the ball down the lane. After awhile everyone was running out of things to try so people started laying and sitting on bowling balls and then sending a different ball down the lane. That was really hard.  Towards the end of the second game, everyone was tired. Their arms hurt and so did their fingers. My last frame I got up and picked the ball I wanted to use. I waited for the people in the @CAPS2 next to me to get done with their turn and then I went up to bowl. I got ready, and brought my arm back before I flung the ball down the lane. Just as I did that, my fingers let go of the ball and I dropped it. The whole side of the bowling alley I was on just busted up laughing. I was so embarrassed. My face was beet red. It was horrible. Then on my next turn I brought ball back, and then brought it forward and I literally threw it into the other lane. I fell to the floor laughing my head off. It was so funny. That night by far, was the best night I have had in quite a long while.

21164,8,"The @CAPS1 We @CAPS2 in @CAPS3  Laughter is a usual @CAPS1 used in many different ways, to release tension, to appreciate a funny joke, or maybe just to express a giggly mood. I find that laughter is the key to having a close relationship with people. It could be because each persons laugh is personal and every time someone laughs they aren't thinking about how they look or what they should say next to fill the awkward silence, their guard is completely down for just an instant. Growing up with my father has proven this fact to me by having our relationship based off of laughing our problems, or difficulties with one another, away. Although I @CAPS2 a good relationship with my @CAPS4 the relationship with my @CAPS7 has always been a silent and guarded one because we @CAPS2 been unsuccessful in bringing humor to the relationship. Which proves to me the point that laughter and humor are two very important things in creating a bond between two people.  Ever since I was a young girl my father and I @CAPS2 always been very close and I @CAPS2 begun to realize that whenever I speak of him to an adult or anyone really, they will know him. Everyone always seems to know my @CAPS4. It might be because of his humor, or maybe because older women find him attractive, or maybe because he's nice, either way he's been popular his whole life. Also, ever since I've known my @CAPS4 he has never been much of a serious type of guy, he will make some sort of humorous comment or joke no matter the circumstance. It doesn't matter if I'm sad, or enraged under the spell of my adolescence and hormones, my mood will completely change and because of this it has shown me the power of laughter. The relationship between my @CAPS7 and I, however, has always been a rocky one, for several reasons I'm sure but one of them I believe is we were never capable of laughing together, or enjoying ourselves. See, she comes from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 and in @LOCATION3 things are done a bit differently. Laughing or fooling around for instance is considered being disrespectful or immature, everyone is to act properly and children are to respect their elders. So when my @CAPS4 married her, I introduced her to sarcasm and jokes. I never got the reaction I was looking for, and since there was never that connection through laughs and humor I felt guarded around her. I @CAPS2 never been able to feel like I can express myself around her. I constantly feel judged and awkward and this has allowed me to see the effects of absence of laughter.  A human beings laughter is emotional and personal, like crying, it immediately allows you to feel happy, sort of like a drug. Once you get someone to laugh you are allowing them to open up to you in a small way, and not only are they opening up to you, but by the good reaction you received you begin to create a connection with them. If there is no laughter in a relationship with two people it tends to get awkward and neither person can feel comfortable opening up to each other. Since I am my @CAPS9 daughter, I tend to apply jokes in the same way he does. When there's tension, when someone's upset and I want to immediately solve the problem, I make them laugh.  Someone once said that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", how I interpret this quote is that laughter is the one @CAPS1 everyone enjoys doing, it can either build or keep relationships going. It's the one @CAPS1 we will always @CAPS2 in @CAPS3. So c'mon guys laugh a little.",20.0,25.0,,45.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21166,8,"   The day was not a fun one. We all just heard really bad news. None of us were even close to smiling. None of us. Even the people that you always see smiling, they had the most serious look on they're face. it was just a bad day. But then one of our friends, @PERSON1, had a great idea of going online to find something to cheer us up. It truly was a amazing idea. We spent hours on the computer just sitting there looking up ridiculous videos that we knew about. Trying to make each other laugh. That's when our day started to be a bit better. But it went back down a bit when a few people left to go home. Only three of us were still at @LOCATION1's house. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I were all sitting there watching @LOCATION2 when a show we all loved came on. Psych. It was a new episode too! what a great day it turned out to be. The show is full of really puny and dumb humor but it fit all three of us. @PERSON1 the most. We were all laughing and having a good time. @PERSON1 was laughing after the show was over. So we asked what was so funny. He just kept laughing. For five minuets he was laughing. when he finally stopped we asked again. What was so darn funny. then he told us. "" I was laughing at my own laugh. I sound really weird. "" that's when we all started laughing. how could he be laughing at his own laugh. we soon realized how hard it was to stop. it turned out to be a okay day after all of what happened. Now, when ever we are having a bad day. we just bring up that day where we laughed at our selves for ten minuets. And the day is all better.",15.0,16.0,,31.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay tells a clear story about how laughter helped to improve a bad day.

21167,8," Recently over the @DATE2 of @DATE1 I was fortunate enough to meet my uncle whom I have never consciously met. This to me was a major part of learning about my family because I met up with not only my uncle , but my legitimate comedian aunt who I have known since I could remember ,and my father at a local @CAPS1 restaurant called @ORGANIZATION2. These three were all siblings, and this allowed me to peer into what siblings will joke about , talk about , and bring forth a feeling of nostalgia for each other. I myself have a stepsister, but the degree of nonsense being presented before me was of a much greater magnitude than I could ever fathom. Everyone was constantly in a state of laughter from the stories of the shenanigans that my father and his brother and @CAPS2 managed to get into. At one point I started having a very hard time breathing.The stories and all-together bad jokes being distributed made me understand that in my family there have been a long line of relatives who inherited some gene that forces us to tell bad jokes. Not even inappropriate but plain stupid jokes. I realized that my children will be telling bad jokes. We dined there for a couple of hours before my dad had to leave for his home up in @LOCATION3, and I needed to be taken home to my family here in @LOCATION4. But tomorrow was planned for a day of exploration of @ORGANIZATION3 and plenty of stupid jokes to be exchanged. I woke up the next day got dressed and prepared myself for laughter I was aware I would be keeling over because of. When I met with uncle and my aunt as well as my uncle's girlfriend we set off towards the fish hatchery on what I believe was the @LOCATION1. All the jokes started slow because everyone was tired and still waking for the rest of the day's trip. We arrived at the hatchery and we began by feeding some fish they have out in a pond.We watched the fish as they swam around in their concrete canals for at least twenty minutes. We then progressed through the hatchery and soon returned to the car and made our trip to @ORGANIZATION1. Once we had parked outside the @ORGANIZATION1 we could hear the beautiful sound of rushing, so beautiful I really needed to pee. We walked along the paths and eventually climbed up a an outlined path to get a get closer view of the @ORGANIZATION1 and we were enthralled. I was being tortured by the thought of using the restroom. I was able to hold it, but it shortened our visit to the @ORGANIZATION1 which was an inconvenience to everyone else but they obliged. I will remember the @ORGANIZATION1 for it's pure natural beauty. After visiting the @ORGANIZATION1 we were going to the very tourist friendly town of @CAPS2's @ORGANIZATION3. We drove by and I nearly lost my mind when I saw the alpacas. Before we did anything at @CAPS2's I first found a restroom and we were later all in agreement that we should get something to eat. A @CAPS4 themed restaurant was an obvious choice and we decided to satisfy our hunger at this fine establishment. They seated us and our host was a very nice young woman. we scanned the menu for something that sounded appetizing. I had found this restaurant was a winner of tastiest burger awards. Falling into temptation I had to order one of these burgers. I do not regret doing this because it was one of the best burgers I have ever had the delight of eating. After satisfying the hunger plaguing us , our group began to browse the gift-shops and the silly novelties that they carried. From bookstores to art galleries to a shop that sold nuts and spices until we came upon an @CAPS5-cream shop. After walking around for the day, @CAPS5-cream was the best thing in our mind to have at the time. I had a very peculiar flavor with berries in it. But I've yet to try a significantly better flavor. When we got our @CAPS5-cream my uncle began to share stories of @LOCATION5 which is where he was visiting from. Quite honestly I wish I could have gone back with him to @LOCATION5, it sounded like a grand city with plenty of places to explore. Sadly I could not, but it is now my goal to eventually visit him where he is living in @LOCATION5. We finished our @CAPS5-cream and then made our way toward the car and drove to @PERSON1 to eat at a very good @CAPS9 restaurant @NUM1o @CAPS10's. We dined there and our stomach was full of exquisite food, almost an entire day of very tasty and savory delights. That was my uncle's @DATE1 day in @LOCATION2. I now wish he would visit more often because of the good time we had on our little expedition across @LOCATION2 with the plethora of bad jokes and stories along with it.",20.0,20.0,40.0,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,,,": The writing is clear and focused.

21168,8,"   I was late like usual for the bus; barley having any time to sit before it moved. I saw my friends sitting in seats directly behind one in other @CAPS2 I stopped and said to them,      ""@CAPS1 guys make it @CAPS2 hard to choose."" I smiled sarcastically.   @PERSON1 who was sitting behind @CAPS3 motioned for me to sit with her. I gave @PERSON1 a quick smile and told her that @CAPS3 and I would turn around and talk with her. @PERSON1 smiled as @CAPS21 leaned her head against my seat. @CAPS3 and I gave @PERSON1 about five minutes of quiet, then we started talking with her. About the time we arrived at the middle school, we all were having a swell time. Until then @CAPS3 and I were fine! But as soon as the bus left the middle school, we were in an uproar of laughter! Everything @CAPS21 said made me laugh and everything I said made her laugh too! After we left the middle school though, this little sixth grader came to sit in front of us and boy was he annoying! He kept turning around, giving @CAPS3 and I weird stares and asking us how many joints we had smoked. Of course that made @CAPS3 and I crack up even more! I was blabbing about how I had stuff in my biology book. But I was talking about notes! The boy obviously thought I was talking about joints. Well for one, I will not smoke, try it, or let it ever come near me. @CAPS2 I thought it was absolutely hilarious that he thought I meant joints. @CAPS3 who was sitting to the left of me, had her head on the seat crying because @CAPS21 was laughing @CAPS2 hard. Seeing this, I laughed even harder @CAPS2 that the sounds coming out of both of us, were the silent and deadly laughter. The boy still turned around with stares and added eyebrows. As soon as we passed the fruit packing company, he started taking in @CAPS8 to us. Now I'm trying to learn @CAPS8, @CAPS2 I didn't have the faintest idea of what he was saying to us. Neither did @CAPS3. Of course he didn't know what he was talking about either. He was leaning over in the isle to talk to these native @CAPS8 speakers who were also watching us with huge smiles on their faces. Being the comedian that I am, I decided to start talking about how he could know more @CAPS8, then me when he was only in sixth grade!He of course quieted right down, but the @CAPS8 speakers were howling with laughter. I mean I was shedding tears the time @CAPS3 got off the bus. After @CAPS21 got off, I decided to check in on ol' @PERSON1. @CAPS21 looked like @CAPS21 was trying to sleep, @CAPS2 I gently nudged her and @CAPS21 looked up at me. I had personally forgotten about @PERSON1 in the back until @CAPS3 got off at her stop.      ""@CAPS16 @CAPS1 @CAPS17.k? Do @CAPS1 need a doctor?"" @PERSON1 asked with a confused grin on her face.I tried to talk, but was laughing in between all of my words,@CAPS2 it came out as pea soup!  ""@CAPS17.k, now @CAPS1 really scare me!"" @PERSON1 retorted with a serious face. ""@CAPS18 come on @PERSON1! I'm suppose to scare @CAPS1! The freshman scare sophomores, sophomores - juniors,and juniors scare the seniors?"" I explained, laughing in between it all. Still my @CAPS19 sounded like pea soup.  ""@CAPS20, but @CAPS1 still scare my personally. Don't do that!"" @CAPS21 belted out laughing. I had put my face over the seat, then lowered my head @CAPS2 that all @CAPS21 could see were my eyes. I then did my @CAPS22 @CAPS23 eyebrow thing in which I move my eyebrows from one side of my forehead to the other, in a wave motion. I thought that I was making her laugh! Which I was, but the outburst made even more people look at us. I mean the attention was fine. But the boy still would interrupt @PERSON1 and I. He was just blurt out,"" @CAPS24 bueno? @CAPS24 bueno?""  @PERSON1 and I again would just look at him. He of course was soaking all the attention in. He then I think, insulted my mother, which @PERSON1 pointed out.But I didn't care at that point because I was in such a happy mood, that I wasn't going to let someone who I didn't even know, ruin it. Both @PERSON1 and I looked up to see her stop coming up. It was really something to think back to all we have done together on the bus. The famous disappearing bus driver ride was a hilarious day and @CAPS2 was the proof reading my @CAPS19 paper bus ride. Good times. I told her this as @CAPS21 was getting off the bus. @CAPS21 laughed and @CAPS2 did I.     Finally, when the bus reached my stop, I crossed over the road and headed home. For fun I decided to look back at the bus. I did and saw the boy starring at me. I lost it then.",20.0,15.0,40.0,40.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,,,":**

21170,8," I met my best friend @PERSON2 when we were in kindergarten. At the time we were both shy, and we looked to one another for comfort. Little did we know the acquaintances we made with each other would soon blossom into a wonderful friendship full of good memories, and plenty of laughter. Last @DATE1, my family took a trip to my grandparents' house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3. My grandparents usually only used the house once a year in the @DATE2, so while they were home in @LOCATION4 my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house. Both of my siblings are in their twenties and are busy with college, so my parents invited @PERSON2 to attend. We were so excited, for this was our first time to @LOCATION3 together. @PERSON2 and I had many activities planned and I couldn't wait to show her around @ORGANIZATION1 (@LOCATION1 @PERSON1). The only downside of the trip was that we would be driving, we would be in the car for about @NUM1 hours. I had known this since we used to go to @ORGANIZATION1 a lot when I was little so I brought along a notebook that we could draw in and write in. By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION1 that notebook had been filled from cover to cover with drawings and funny sayings that @PERSON2 and I had quoted each other for. @PERSON2 and I have an odd kind of humor, we think everything is funny when were together. It can be the most ridiculous thing and we will burst out laughing and no one will know why.  Finally, a good @NUM1 hours later we arrived in @LOCATION2, it was late though and we had to unpack, therefore I wouldn't be showing @PERSON2 around until the next day. That didn't mean our night wasn't exciting, in the backyard of the house there is a pool house, and in order to keep someone at the home when no one is there my grandparents rent out the pool house. My parents had known that a man named @CAPS1 lived in the pool house. None of us had met him, only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house when he attended college in @ORGANIZATION1. That night my mom asked me to go get my dad from the back yard because dinner was ready, it was dark outside so I made @PERSON2 come with me. When we got outside we saw my dad had introduced himself to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 looked exactly how I imagined him, he had on red shorts, no shoes and a peach colored t-shirt. He had sandy blond hair and was pretty scruffy, he looked like a big beach bum. @CAPS1 quickly made his way over to me and @PERSON2 and introduced himself. He was pretty nice and very goofy. Throughout our whole conversation @PERSON2 and I couldn't keep straight faces.@CAPS1 said that he had to go so he wanted to teach us a handshake that he made up. He stuck his hand out and curled his index, ring, and middle finger so that they were in towards his palm and the only remaining fingers sticking out were his pinky and thumb. He gestured us to do the same thing. We all did as he told us and stuck our hands in the center of where we were standing and he tapped his pinky and thumb against our pinkies and thumbs, he said good evening and ran back to the pool house. It was very odd, but so funny that my dad, @PERSON2 and I still do this on occasion.  The next day, I took @PERSON2 downtown, and showed her around. When we were on our way back we stopped inside a craft store, that I, nor @PERSON2 had ever been in. When we walked in it looked like any other average craft store, but as we explored a little more we noticed there was a huge section of armor and helmets that @CAPS3 soldiers wore. Us being big dorks decided that we had to put them on, so we put on the helmets and armor and stood by the windows in the front shop and waved at people. The ladies working in the craft shop were laughing at us and it had us laughing at ourselves too. We fell down from laughing so hard, at this point the people who were working were not laughing anymore they were mad that we had fallen while wearing the armor. They came over and told us to take it off and that we needed to leave. We did what they told us to do. By the end of the trip we had made so many memories, and we couldn't wait to return the following year. In my opinion laughter is very important in relationships, it is healthy and it means that sometimes you don't need words to express how you feel. This @DATE1 @PERSON2 and I will be returning to @LOCATION1 @PERSON1 and are looking forward to many new memories and laughs that we will share.

21171,8," In the @DATE1 on the month of @DATE2, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS1, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any @CAPS1, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name @PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise. I do believe that we all have this person, this personality within us, empowering us to drive forth and never look back.End.",20.0,15.0,,35.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay tells a clear story about the author's experience with laughter.

21174,8,"                   Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People A thing we have done since birth is laugh. Laughter is something incredible in the world of human existence, it is something that relieves awkward situations, brings people together, and makes life a little bit easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares in common. Some people find laughter in different things than others but still we can all laugh together. Many times in my life has laughter helped me through tough situations, brought me close to someone, and just made life more enjoyable.   I remember once I was trying out for a volleyball team. It was the first day of tryouts and I was really nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them. There was one thing I knew about them though. It was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful. Tryouts began and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there, but I ignored them and just kept working hard. Tryouts went okay for the rest of the week but still something just didn't feel right. I still felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of tryouts and the girls had warmed up a little, but I still felt a little uncomfortable. After the last practice it was time to announce the teams. I was really nervous cause what if I didn't make it? Or what if I did, but everyone hated me on the team? He announced the names and I was beginning to give up hope when he said my name. I was so excited, but the girls seemed to be annoyed by my name getting called. When I got home I told my parents and they were excited for me. I then told them how I didn't really know anybody and kind of felt like an outsider. They asked me if I had tried talking to anyone, and I said no not really they didn't try talking to me so I thought why should I? My mom then told me that I could only get to know them if put myself out there. I thought about it and realized I really hadn't. I ignored them as much as they ignored me. I also wasn't myself, because I really am a cool person and I am fun to be around, I just for some reason I crawled into a shell this time. I decided the next day at practice I would put myself out there. The next practice I showed up and was partnered up with a girl named @PERSON1. It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball back an forth. Then I started talking to her and making jokes she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time. The rest of the practice went great. The awkward moments faded away into laughter. We all worked hard and joked around with each other, laughed, and I really felt like we were bonding. They laughter had brought us together. All this time it felt like we were so far away and different and really it wasn't like that at all. Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we had in common and that we were all the same. I believe that day that laughter brought our team together.  I will never forget that day. It was the day I learned how important laughter was in a relationship, getting to know someone, and how well it brings people together. That season of volleyball I made many new friends. I also learned a valuable lesson that and awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter. Today I still talk to those girls on the team and still today we all laugh together, just because you known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and laughter has to fade away, because I believe it should get stronger. Whenever I am meeting new people I always try to break the ice and lighten up the mood with something funny, because I think that a big point in our lives is to be happy, have fun, and all laugh togther. That is exactly what I plan to do.",20.0,22.0,,42.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21175,8," Day after day, people laugh. For many different reasons, only those who are laughing @MONTH1 know.There have been times in everyone's lives, where they just need to laugh. Maybe because we are upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even to just get a conversation started. I was @NUM1 years old, I was finally hired for a job. I am now an employee for @ORGANIZATION1. Being the youngest guy @CAPS1 the crew, I had to make an impression. I didn't know @CAPS11 to do. My first few days were awkward and silent.I was so nervous, i kept thinking to myself "" @CAPS11 am I doing, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, don't knowwhat i am doing."" @CAPS1 one of the hottest days of the year, we had finished our work for the day and everyone @CAPS1 the crewwas going to the river. I wasn't planning @CAPS1 going, until @CAPS2, one of the guys that i will also be going to school with came up to me and said "" hey @CAPS3 @CAPS21 need a ride to the river?"" and @CAPS6 laughed. "" @CAPS4 could @CAPS21 give me a ride to my house to grab a pair of shorts?"" I replied.  "" @CAPS5 I'll lend @CAPS21 a pair."" @CAPS6 said. "" I don't think @CAPS21'll have a pair that will fit my fat ass."" I replied. "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS17 i do lets go."" @CAPS6 said @CAPS2, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @CAPS11 I thought was coffee in it. I asked him. "" @CAPS10 do @CAPS21 need coffee in the morning?"" I said "" @CAPS11 are @CAPS21 talking about?"" @CAPS6 replied "" The bottle."" I said "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS21 dumb ass, that's not coffee that chew spit."" @CAPS6 repliedI just left it at that. We got to his house, walked in through the garage, and there was the cutest dog i had ever seen,her name was @ORGANIZATION3. She followed us though the house, and @CAPS6 gave me the tour. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @CAPS1 our way. We all met back up at work, and went from there. This being my first time going to the river with them, I saw so much of the property that i had never seen before. We went past our hay barn and down a gravel road. to this gate, which led to the river. I had never seen the gate, I'm riding in the bed of @CAPS2's truck, bouncing around. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river,everyone starts changing. My bosses daughter is there and our crew leader's girlfriend. And I glance over at them once there dressedand my crew leader, @PERSON1, looks at me and says ""@CAPS16"". and so I turn around and @CAPS6's tossing the cooler at me. I try and @CAPS16 the cooler but it throws me to my butt. Everyone starts laughing even I do, @CAPS6 comes over and helps me up and says, "" that's for looking at my cousin and girlfriend."""" @CAPS17 I looked, hell i aint got no chance of hooking up with them anyway"" I replied. Everyone laughed, and that's how we started out day at the river. In a great mood. We sit around and listen to music talking and having fun.Then @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, start floating down the river. So we all go, all of us trying to @CAPS16 up. We finally do all of us are sore from the rocks @CAPS1 our rears. There is this log I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top, and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. some how @CAPS19 perfectly in the river. All of us start jumping off and having a good old time.   It starts to get dark, and we get to the bank, start walking back. everyone going a different way because we all know the best way back.we all finally make it back. And go up to @CAPS6 house, once we reach the house, they decide we're going out to eat. Once we get to @ORGANIZATION2 all order, @PERSON1 says to me "" @CAPS20 o, @CAPS21 know we were all kinda worried about @CAPS21, @CAPS21 never spoke."" "" I had nothing to say"" I replied."" @CAPS21 know, your gonna get yourself in trouble checking out a guys family and girl"". @CAPS6 said."" I know, but i cant help it"". I replied. I looked over at his cousin and winked."" @CAPS21 have some balls, but I'm glad @CAPS21 @CAPS1 the crew"". @CAPS6 said. That's when I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @CAPS2's, and we just sat up watching @CAPS24 and joking back and forth.Now after looking back, I see that a good sense of humor can go a long ways. creates a good relationship.

21176,8," Laughter is how me and my friends connect most of the time, and that's how i became friends with a lot of them. You know when your in a new class and you don't know anybody in there so its kinda awkward because you feel like your a loner. I try to make the best of a situation and try to make new friends but I'm not always the best at it, so when i get a chance i make them laugh. First we take baby steps and the more we laugh together it seems like the closer we are to each other. By the end of the semester you don't really like the class but you don't want it to be over because you made such a good friend. The next semester you find out you have a class with that person but they don't like the class so they move out. Then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets kinda awkward. The way we started off our friendship was really by accident but i didn't know many people in the class and the people that i did know weren't really my friends. We sat by each other, and after so long of awkward silence between us two she made a joke and i started to laugh. The next thing we know is within a week and would talk to each other and soon enough we hung out some. About half way through the semester we would get in trouble in class for talking to much and we started to realize we were starting to be best friends. The semester went on and we were hanging out more and more and she was the only one i would hang out with sometimes. By the time the semester was almost over we didn't know what our classes were so we thought we would be split up. The day we got our schedules we talked to each other and seen what our classes were. We seen we had one class together and we were excited. The first day of the second semester we went into the art class that we had together and we were laughing the whole time. At the end of the period she told me she didn't want to be in that class because shes not an artsy type of person. I went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to switch out like she said or not. At the end of sixth period I seen her and she told me that she got switched out and went to a class that she wanted. I know people in that class still but its not the same because I knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other. Its a couple weeks into the last semester and we hardly ever talk sometimes it gets awkward just to be around her because its not like how it used to be. Laughter is how me and her became friends and classes is what tore us apart.",19.0,15.0,,34.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21178,8," @CAPS1 is laughter important? In my opinion, laughter is very important! How could laughter affect someones life? If there was any, or not? Also, @CAPS1 is laughter important to me? Laughter is important for so many reasons. In a relationship, every day life, and with the ones you have in your life. How would the world be if there wasn't any laughter in this world? It would be very dry and dull. It helps connect people together, if they have the same sense of humor. Having a good sense of humor is very important these days. A lot of people use sarcasm which isn't ""laughter"" but to some people it could be or some could feel hurt by it. However, most people that feel hurt by it,don't have a sense of humor in any way, shape or form. Most people have heard the saying, ""it takes more muscles to frown then smile,"" that is a very true and factual fact! Having a glorious relationship is the best thing with my significant other. The affectionate that he can be by sharing our laughter together, brings us closer to a point where we couldn't be at all if there wasn't for laughter and communication. Having a a sense of humor is a important thing in a relationship, to most people. @CAPS1 would you want to be with someone who bores you? Who @CAPS2't make you laugh when your sad? I sure wouldn't want that. Laughter brings out great communication skills, by laughing with someone it shows your type of opinion on the subject you are talking about. In a relationship, could you imagine if there wasn't no laughter in it? Would you feel the same about the person your with if there isn't any laughter? How would you feel knowing the person you love isn't very ""humorous"" and @CAPS2't like to laugh often? I couldn't handle that. I would want to love someone who is very funny with a great sense of humor.  Laughter is important to me for so many reasons. I would rather be around very ecstatic people then someone who brings me down! I consider, laughter to be one of the most important things in my life, and in my relationship with my significant other. It brings us closer. People ask, "" @CAPS2't it ever get old being happy all the time?"" ""Of course not!"" I would say in defense. @CAPS1 would someone think that way? Being in a phenomenal mood all the time, would be the most amazing place I would want to be in my life and with my partner.  In my opinion, I would think that almost everyone would feel close to what I'm saying. However, people have their own opinions about laughter and how and @CAPS1 it's important, there are titled to their opinion. I know a few people, that don't like to be in a very cheery mood, that would prefer to be sad all the time and not care.

21180,8," My high school @CAPS1 basketball team isn't the best team, but the one thing that we do have, is the ability to make each other laugh. At the start of @DATE1 the school held try outs and the teams were decided. After graduating seniors and some players not coming out, or team was brand new. Full with all different ages of players. we all were civil with each other at practices but we weren't all best friends that wanted to hang out outside of practice. The @CAPS1 team decided to take a retreat to the beach and stay @CAPS2 for a weekend.  When we went to leave to the beach our phones were taken and we had assigned seats in the cars. This trip seemed like it was going to be a long one with out my phone. We arrived at the house @TIME1. As we all found somewhere to relax, shower or sleep myself and most of the team ended up in the living room conversing with the coaches. we all sat on the floor recalling stories about the game from that @TIME1 or funny stories from our past. By the time we finished telling stories it had reached @TIME2 and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry.  As we sat on the floor complaining about tiredness or hunger we all started to turn our attention to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 was starting to go on a tirade about how hungry she was. In her opinion she thought the house we were staying in should of already been stoked with food for us for when we got @CAPS2, but @CAPS2 was no food. As she continued on her rant she became more and more mad which made us laugh harder and harder. Finally she reached her point. ""@CAPS2's no steak or chicken up in these mother freak-in cabinets."" @PERSON1 proclaimed. At that point the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollable. @PERSON1 didn't understand why it was so funny, but we kept laughing and laughing at the fact that she just said that @CAPS2 should be steak and chicken in the cabinets. The outburst of laughter continued on for the next five to ten minutes.  When we finally started to calm down @PERSON2 came down stairs. She had missed everything that had happened and as we went to fill her in @LOCATION1 stopped us. ""@PERSON2 @CAPS4 up on the counter and look in the cabinet,"" @PERSON1 said. @PERSON2 hesitantly got up on the counter and slowly started to open the cabinet. When she opened the cabinet she looked inside and all she could see was chips. She turned around and looked at @LOCATION1. ""@CAPS3?"" asked @PERSON2. As she turned to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 just sat @CAPS2 smiling. Then she finally answered the question. ""@CAPS4 me some of those chips right @CAPS2!"" @PERSON1 said.  Everyone in the room started laughing as @PERSON2 was so confused to why she was asked to @CAPS4 on a counter just so she could @CAPS4 @PERSON1 chips, who had been sitting next to the counter the whole @TIME1. The whole basketball team started laughing again. @PERSON2 got down from the counter but with no chips in hand. We all continued laughing and kept talking about @CAPS3 had just happened for the next @NUM1 minutes.  As everyone finally started to settle into their beds for the @TIME1 @CAPS2 were still those moments of ""@CAPS5 when this was said"", and ""@CAPS5 when she did this"". That first @TIME1 that we spent at the beach did more for us then we realized. By going to the beach and making memories together we were brought together by two common things. The love for basketball, and most of all the ability to be able to come together as a team all because of the memories we shared that @TIME1 in the kitchen. Today we still @CAPS4 on each others nerves and sometimes we lose our tempers with another but, we will always laugh about the crazy things that happened on the trip but the thing we laugh about the most is @CAPS3 happened that @TIME1 in the kitchen.

21181,8," It was a regular day in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That special day we were supposed to start our state writing tests. I wasn't necessarily worried about it due to the fact that I have always done good on state testing, and never failed at test for state testing. @CAPS22 it was pretty much a regular day for @PERSON1. But I didn't know @CAPS18 awaited me in the computer lab..... Thanks to new @ORGANIZATION1 state testing laws, we have to take the writing test on the computer. The only place in the school that has enough computers for the whole class to take was the either the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, or the old computer lab (I don't know why we used the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, but we did). @CAPS22, I was already in a hyper mood because @CAPS1's sense of humor normally cheers me up and puts me in a hyper mood. @CAPS22, as we were walking to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 started cracking jokes about @PERSON3 mainly because everyone else does, @CAPS22 we just add to the effect. @CAPS19 we reached the computer lab, but the door was locked. @CAPS22 while we waited for @PERSON2 to lock her door and come down to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 made a few more jokes about @PERSON3, but little did I know the real humor was awaiting for me in the computer lab. When @PERSON2 got to the door and unlocked it, I was the @ORGANIZATION1 to come in and sit down in the seat I desired. @PERSON4 followed next to me, and @CAPS4 next to him. I remember a trick with the computer when you push @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 and when it goes to a different screen, you push @CAPS8 and it will put the computer to sleep. I tried it a couple times while he was looking and he would always swat my hand away. After a while, I decided the best way to pull this trick was to make him forget about it, @CAPS19 do it when he was least expecting it. @CAPS22 about @NUM1 minutes later after I planned my trick, I tried it again. I caught him looking away at @CAPS4. @CAPS22 I pushed @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7. @CAPS19 it went to a different screen and I pushed @CAPS8. My plan had worked. @CAPS19 @PERSON4 turned around right as soon as the computer was going to sleep and freaked out. He started cussing and hitting me. I thought this was mildly funny @CAPS22 I got a couple laughs out of it, but nothing could have prepared me for @CAPS18 was about to happen. After @PERSON4 woke his computer up and got started with his test, @CAPS4 asked @CAPS18 I was laughing about. I told him, ""@CAPS15, you should have seen it. I put @PERSON4's computer to sleep and he flipped out on me."" @CAPS4 laughed and went back to his test. Two minutes went by and @CAPS4 tapped on my shoulder. I looked at him and asked, ""@CAPS18 up kid?"" @CAPS19 @CAPS4 said, ""@CAPS21 this."" @CAPS22 I sat up straight and looked at him. @CAPS19 he asked @PERSON4, ""@CAPS18 did @PERSON1 do to your computer? This?"" and he held the power button down and shut the computer off right in the middle of @PERSON4's test. I thought I was going to cry. It was @CAPS22 funny me and @CAPS4 started laughing as loud as possible. @PERSON2, of course, wasn't happy about it. @CAPS22 she told me and @CAPS4 to quiet down. But it didn't matter. A little scolding didn't compare to how funny it was.  @CAPS22 we ended up going back to our own tests. I hope I do good on this. I really need the grade to pass.",15.0,22.0,40.0,40.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,,,":**

21182,8," Have @CAPS3 ever been in that mood were @CAPS3 just can not stop laughing, and no matter what, @CAPS3 just can't stop? That is the problem my good friend, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and I have when we are together. Most of the time we are just talking about random things and we both find it hilarious. Luckily, for the teachers, we only have two classes together. In both of those classes we sit next to each other though. So the teachers didn't luck out too much.  Just the other day, in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we were allowed to move are seats around and have that be our new spot in the class. The girl that was sitting next to me moved and sat next to @PERSON1. Now, @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't like this girl very much, so I spoke up and said ""@PERSON1, @CAPS3 can sit next to me!"". @PERSON1 grabbed her stuff in an unusually quick manner, and came and sat next to me. The funny thing was when she sat down she said ""@CAPS3 saved my life."". For some reason @PERSON1 and I just started laughing non-stop. We couldn't control it. To be honest, it wasn't that funny. I guess it was just in the way she said I saved her life. I'm glad @PERSON1 sits next to me in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With out her, it would be so boring.  In @CAPS6, we sit next to each other and we have a good time. Our @CAPS6 class is at the end of the day so we are just ready to go home by then. @PERSON1 and I sit next to each other and when we are taking notes, @PERSON1 and I pass notes back-and-forth to each other. She and I talk about everything, from the predicaments a teenage girl runs into in high school, to boys and parents. I can pretty much tell her everything, and that's a good friend. Over the years @PERSON1 and I have become closer and closer friends. Last year, she and I had at least three or four classes together. So we have been in classes together previously. @PERSON1 and I have become more acquainted and more open with things. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. One reason why I think we've become good friends is because she and I find the same things funny. We have the same interests in things.She is a good friend and I'm glad she's my friend . Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I am going to definitely have to agree with that.",15.0,16.0,,31.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,4,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21183,8," Hi my name is @CAPS1. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS2. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS2 made me the person I am but @CAPS2 has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1.  @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME1 air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON1 good @TIME1 and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME1. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS2 hurtful but to me @CAPS2 is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS2 just makes @CAPS2 worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON1 tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS2 cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS2 to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON1 will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS2 out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS2 can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH1 come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS2 has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS2 brought me back up again.",18.0,18.0,,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21185,8,"It's true @CAPS8 they say, time flies when you're having fun. On a particularly warm @DATE1 @TIME1, a rehearsal was in session for the wonderful production of ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2"" and I was bringing my best friend, @PERSON2 some cheap but delicious food. We talked and ate for a while but eventually it was time for me to go. @CAPS3 we were walking down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building I asked if they needed any help with the play. ""@CAPS3 a matter of fact we do!"" @CAPS7 said enthusiastically. ""We need a ladies costume @CAPS4.""I had absolutely no idea @CAPS8 that meant, but I felt that the position had potential. ""@CAPS5, I can do that. Just one question..."" I said a little confused.""@CAPS6?"" @CAPS7 replied, slightly amused.""@CAPS8 exactly am I going to @CAPS12 doing?"" I asked her.We changed course and headed for the costume room so that @CAPS7 could introduce me to, @PERSON1 who would @CAPS12 my boss for the next two weeks. We arrived to find that @CAPS7 had already gone home for the night. A little exasperated, @PERSON2 told me the basic idea of the job.""@CAPS9 basically @CAPS8's going to happen is that you are going to @CAPS12 in charge of the changing rooms and the costume changes on stage."" @CAPS7 said quickly.""@CAPS11 okay, I can do that."" I replied with confidence.@CAPS3 I began to talk to her more about @CAPS8 I would @CAPS12 doing @CAPS7 said that @CAPS7 had to go because break was over. ""@CAPS12 here at @NUM1 tomorrow morning and you'll learn everything you need!"" @CAPS7 said hurriedly.@CAPS3 @CAPS7 ran off into the theatre I could hear the lead of the play beginning his lines. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice....""I left feeling more happy and excited than I have felt in months.  The next morning I made my way to the theatre which is located at the school which I previously attended. It felt odd going back there but at the same time so completely normal. I was even more comforted by knowing that I could see my friends everyday. I could hug them and laugh with them, I could have social interaction! Something that because of online school I have been lacking. I walked into the theatre and @CAPS3 soon @CAPS3 I did I was bombarded with excited people asking why I was there while hugging me tight. ""I'm helping out with the costuming!"" I said just @CAPS3 excited @CAPS3 they were. I broke away from the group of people and found, @PERSON2 who was on stage directing the lighting people. We talked for a while and then @CAPS7 took me to the costume room where, @PERSON1 was waiting for me. @PERSON1, was a classy looking lady. @CAPS7 wore a light grey cardigan and a colored top with some corduroy pants and sensible shoes. Immediately @CAPS7 started to tell me @CAPS8 my duties were and @CAPS8 I was going to @CAPS12 doing that day.""I'm just going to have you watch the rehearsal today, just to get a feel of @CAPS8's going on."" @CAPS7 handed me a pen and a pad of paper""@CAPS15 notes about where the lighting ques are and that kind of thing."" @CAPS7 said.I walked out and wondered to the auditorium and took my seat in the second row of seats. The lights were lowered and rehearsal began. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice...""@CAPS16 I knew it, the end of the day had come and I wasn't in any hurry to leave.

21186,8," In life @CAPS13 share many of your moments laughing and enjoying the sweet and gentle sound of the chorus that @CAPS13 and the people in your life share. Laughter can bring @CAPS13 instantly to enjoyment no matter how unbearable the struggles in your life @MONTH1 be.  I've had many moments in my life that became enjoyable because of laughing and smiling. But one moment sticks out above the others. This moment is the @CAPS1 before my grandpa passed away. This @CAPS1 was the best of all. It was a white @CAPS1, and for once the snow wasn't the only thing that was gleaming. On this day, everyone in my family was smiling, we were all thankful that my grandpa survived his sudden heart-attack that happened the week before and we all knew that his time was near. We had to make his last @CAPS1 a great one to end on.  My grandpa was the sweetest old man, he could always make @CAPS13 smile no matter how sad @CAPS13 were. He was a man, who enjoyed the laughter of his grandchildren and he made sure that he made an impact in our lives. This @CAPS1 though was one where our laughter made the largest impact.  On @DATE1, everyone on my dad's side of the family drove over the hills to their destination; my house. The house was covered in @CAPS1 decor and was gleaming with the happiness that each one of us held inside of us. My grandpa was the first to walk in. I leaped into his arms and said ""I love @CAPS13 grandpa with all my heart! Merry @CAPS1!"" @CAPS8 this he smiled and began to tickle me like he always did ever since I was little. He grabbed my hands and began twirling me around, humming his favorite song. As we were twirling to the tune of his favorite song, my laughter broke out. When this happened, I looked straight into my grandpa's eyes and saw the love that he had. He always said that ""The laughter of a young child can always bring joy to anyone, even the cruelest of people."" @CAPS9 we were still twirling, all my other family members walked into the house. They smiled and laughed at us, but we didn't care. This was going to be a great @CAPS1, nothing could ruin it for us. When everyone got into the house we all sat down in the living room sharing stories of all the old and good times that we shared. We all knew that this was what my grandpa needed, and in his eyes we could all see that he was happy that he had a family, that could put away all of the hardships we were going through and allow ourselves to sit as a family and enjoy each other. Everyone was laughing now, remembering the stories that made our family what is was. My aunt @PERSON2 was the one that knew all of them by heart, she could even act them out. My grandpa sat there and laughed. He was filled with enjoyment as he watched his only daughter do what she did best.  When dinner was almost ready, my grandpa and I sat down at the dinner table all by ourselves. We began playing the game that we always played. I got underneath the table and hopped up in random seats acting like a cat. My grandpa would always say "" @CAPS11 down @PERSON1, that food isn't for @CAPS13."" then I would go and sit next to him and meow at his side, and we would just laugh. No one else understood the bond that my grandpa and I had. But that didn't matter, every holiday we were the ones that were always laughing; we enjoyed life and we never let anything @CAPS11 to us. He was the only one in my family that understood enjoyment and he helped me live my life that way.  Dinner was served and we all took our normal seats. My mother's food looked amazing like usual. My grandpa and I sat right across from each other like we always would and made the most unusual faces at each other. Our laughter filled the room and made that @CAPS1 even better. As we were all finishing our dinner, my grandpa got up and walked to the door looking outside at the beautiful landscape covered in a white blanket. I walked to his side and looked up at him. He smiled down at me and said ""@CAPS13 never realize the beautiful things in life, until your life is fading. The most beautiful thing to me is your laugh. It always brings joy to my heart. If I could only hear one more sound, it would be your laugh @PERSON1, and if I could only see one more thing it would be your smile. I'm happy to be your grandpa and I'm glad that I got to live and see @CAPS13 grow up to be such a beautiful and sweet girl. Always remember, enjoy ever moment. Especially the moments with the ones that @CAPS13 love.""",21.0,18.0,,39.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,":**

21188,8," Allot of people say that laughter is a big part of any relationship, and i agree allot of people don't always laugh and in every relationship laughter is a big component to make someones day of the greatest day they have ever had. There is always someone who is having a bad time in school or at home or any other place and when you see someone like that you should always cheer them up like saying something nice or just even saying something like hope you have a good day @DATE3, give them a smile so that can put there bad thing that is avoiding them from laughing aside and you have just made there day by sharing your smile and laughter with them. Allot of people need someone they can go to when they are going through a very hard situation or problem they are going through that they cant go through it alone in there home or even at school and they need someone they can talk to and share there feelings with a shoulder they can cry on and that always makes someone feel good letting all that pain and inner self out to others we all need to make someone who is going through a hard time smile and laugh and that is always something very healthy in a relationship and it is a way to offer that person who is in pain or sad have e healing. This reminds me of a true story i know because i was there. One time there was a girl who i had in my elementary school she was a very happy girl she shared her laughter and happiness with others she was someone anyone could go to when they had a problem or they just needed someone to talk to she was one of the nicest girl in school everyone liked her and she tended to always show love and respect to others it always seemed as if her life was so perfect she had no worries she was just full of joy and she was only child in her family so of course her parents would always give her what she wanted or at least that's what we all thought. It had been a @DATE1 and we it came to be @DATE2 and we were all in school except this girl, she never missed a day of school so it was very strange for her not to be there, but just as every other person she must have been sick so that's what we thought except she missed another day and then another, and another, so i was starting to think she had moved away and she was probably never coming back, but the next week after that she showed up i was very happy to see her i had missed that girl except there was something very different about her she wasn't the same she wasn't laughing or smiling anymore she had lost that sparkle that made her so different. I thought to myself ""what is wrong with her?"" i finally found out that she had been gone because her mom had past away i was so sad i didn't know what to say she was just so happy and from one day to another she didn't have her mom anymore i thought i have both of my parents and she doesn't i should share the happiness she had share with me and others right back to her and be there for her now that she was gong through the hardest time of her life. That's why being happy and sharing your happiness with others always is the greatest thing you can do for someone because you never know what kind of things there going through and they need someone to make them smile and laugh.",17.0,20.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21189,8," Building the @CAPS1 with Laughter @CAPS2 a very early age my uncle would bring the funniest cards to mine and my brothers birthdays, just to see our reaction. Then when my uncle moved to the west coast, near us, we would piss each other off just see each others reaction. We have always known when each other is having a bad day and when to lift them up when they are down.  When my family and I would go back to @CAPS3 at an early age, we would always celebrate each others birthdays with our uncle. He would bring the funniest cards to give us and we would sit there and laugh about them for hours. Then when he moved to @LOCATION1 my older brother, @PERSON1, and I started to get him funny cards to see who had the best one. We got each other cards that had sexual humor to gross humor. We would come to each others birthdays with a grin, @CAPS2 one ear to the other, waiting for the person to open up the card. One year, for his birthday, I got him a card that had some older ladies on it and had some sexual humor towards it. Lets just say nobody has beaten that card. My uncle and I work in the same building but doing way different jobs. He is the sales manager and I put the items together for him to sell. When I walk into work, I always pass by him to see how he is doing. For the most part, he is either laughing or pissed off about something in his day. On days that he is upset and walks outside to make a label for @ORGANIZATION1, I start to make fun of him right away. Sometimes he gets even more angry. But when he does, he always seems to laugh after the fact, or come back at me with a rude remark. Everyday this happens and it always seems to brighten up our days.  We bought two season passes to @CAPS4.Hood this year. At first I wasn't very good at skiing, and would always fall. When I would fall, he would board down to me while laughing and I would get very upset. We would laugh on the way home talking about how I would always fall. But as time went on, I slowly got better than him and would be waiting for him at the bottom of the run. One time, when we went up, he just couldn't seem to stay on his board and would fall non-stop. This was the time when I could finally get him back for all the times when he laughed at me for not being able to stay on my skis. I never laughed so hard in my life on that ride home. Coming down and making remarks at him about not being able to stay on his board was one of the most warming things I have ever felt. It wasn't warming for me to make rude remarks. It was warming to me, to see that he couldn't say anything back, because his time finally came to be made fun of.  My uncle and I have the relationship we do today, because of his impact on me at an early age. Him being able to make me laugh at his jokes and knowing when to brighten up my day has been one of the best things that has happened to me to date. Changing my life for the best and changing my personality for the best. These laughing experiences have turned our ""uncle-nephew"" relationship into a friend relationship. My life is full of laughter and will be full of laughter for my life because of one person.",19.0,18.0,,37.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21190,8," When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade I went to @ORGANIZATION1. This year I felt as if I was old enough to ride the "" big kid"" rides which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 little sister @CAPS3. We had to go though there because it was the fastest way in to the park. There were to giant stain glass like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The door were beautiful. They had an outdoor seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ORGANIZATION1 mountains. We all walked in to the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall. We walk all the way though the lobby @ORGANIZATION1 followed the signs till we got to the park entrance. There was a man made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear that one of the rides was built around. It was early in the morning so the @LOCATION1 heat had not yet set in completely. We started out with the smaller rides @ORGANIZATION1 side attractions like it's tough to be a bug @NUM1,shopping in the park @ORGANIZATION1 parades. My mom was determent to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage but we never made it back in time. It was about noon @ORGANIZATION1 the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. the song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was playing in the back ground. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park. on the opposite side of the pier was a man made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food @ORGANIZATION1 popcorn, it was making me @LOCATION3. We continued walking until be got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2'. There was a fifteen minuet wait time for the ride which wasn't long. my older sister @ORGANIZATION1 i jumped in line @ORGANIZATION1 began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down.  finally we came to the front of the line. the man standing there working the ride asked ""how many?"". my sister held up two fingers @ORGANIZATION1 the man pointed at the ground next to him @ORGANIZATION1 said ""row eight"". The next set of cars came in @ORGANIZATION1 they ushered us into the the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ORGANIZATION1 stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that i had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a mans voice @ORGANIZATION1 some background music. the voice did a count down form ten @ORGANIZATION1 the yelled "" blast off"" @ORGANIZATION1 the ride took of at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ORGANIZATION1 plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists @ORGANIZATION1 turns the ride even when upside down! when it came time to take the picture at the end I was crying I was laughing so hard. my sister @ORGANIZATION1 I exited the ride @ORGANIZATION1 walked over to the booth were they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner.

So I ended up coming up with the idea of going out side and maybe riding our bikes to the store, an grabbing some ice cream and water then ride up hamburger hill and possibly sit under the shade. Everyone agreed to the plan so all my friends left we all took showers at our homes and met me up at the corner and then rode our bikes off to the store got all the items and as we were making our way to the hill a couple of the big kids who were in middle school came and jumped us all and stole all our of food supplies. Now these guys have always been picking on us for some reason and till this day @CAPS1 still never understood why maybe it was because we didn't like what they did or maybe they hate us cause my friend @PERSON3 stole one of the kids girlfriends but that's a different story. So after they got done pounding our faces into the dirt they got on their bikes and rode off into the sunset like if they were proud of themselves for beating on @NUM2 yr old, our day was ruined i had a black eye,@PERSON3 threw up, @PERSON2 was walking with a limp and poor little @PERSON1 had a little scratch on his tiny little head. After the brutal beating the next day I called a group meeting in our tree house to be for real i was tired of them constantly beating on us stealing our food and giving us ultra wedgies we needed to make a stand against our oppressors cause for too long this has been going on so i devised a plan a perfect plan to make sure they never hurt us again and the plan went like this, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 would talk to all of the kids that have been abused by them and get them to join our revolt,then we would get all of the water balloons eggs and rotten food we could. One of the kids knew that they always left their houses and got on their bikes at @NUM3 pm so at @NUM4 at night me and @PERSON3 would flatten a couple of their tires, each thing that came into my tiny little mind was just genius so after day's of planning and hard labor and complaining to our parents for money the plan was finally set, and so we waited and just like the kid said they all came out at @NUM3 once they noticed their tires had been slashed a couple of the kids jumped out of the bushes and started hurling food at them then me and a couple of the kids was riding past them on our bikes and threw water balloons at them they all split up the ones who's bikes weren't slashed they chased after us they were going pretty fast and nearly caught up with us when i gave the signal @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 pulled the rope and the big kids flew off their bikes and face planted like in the movies and it really seemed like the plan was going pretty well and it seemed like we were winning the war but as usual some thing are to good to be true it seems that we forgot about the other big kids in the neighborhood and when they saw this all hell broke loose soon after their reinforcements came in they over powered us like a lion on a gazelle beating each and everyone of us like we stole something but good thing i was being smart and told my parents and my friends parents on the kids and sooner our parents came yelled and screamed at them and told their parents what's been going on and as a godd ending they were grounded for the rest of them @DATE1 and finally we all played in peace without no fears.",11.0,18.0,34.0,34.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3,12,,": The writing is clear and focused.

21192,8,      Have you ever laughed so hard that you peed?That @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not have happened to me. In my story I'm going to talk about the funniest time I have ever had with my best friend @CAPS1.       How it all started was that it was my best friends birthday and she was going to spend the night at her grandmas house. She invite only me to come with her so I couldn't say no. @CAPS1's grandma owned a @CAPS2 @CAPS3. She was old and was in a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club. I don't know about you but it always seems to me that old people have to be in some kinda of club. So anyways in her her club what the did was go on trips. @CAPS1 and I thought that would be fun to go on a trip. So we meant everyone at @ORGANIZATION1.         @CAPS1's grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip. I wanted @CAPS4. The bottle was really cool. It had a top like a water bottle would have. I got the red kind cause it the best. We got are drinks and @CAPS1's grandma said to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip.      So here is the funny part of the story. I got into the car first. I was pretty thirsty so I decided to unscrew the cap it pulled open to paper back on the sell. I twisted the cap back on and took a drink. Mean while @CAPS1 got into the car and closed the door behind her cause her grandma was talking to the adults. While she was closing it she got her hair caught in the door. She was laughing and yelling at me to come help her. I was laughing too hard to come help her. I had my drink between my legs and the cap was open and remember its like a water bottle cap. I laughed so hard that I squeezed my legs together and my juice went straight into the front seat. It didn't get and were else just into her grandma seat. It was like a rocket it was so funny. @CAPS1 with her head still stuck in the door asked what that notice was on the seat. I told her it was my juice. Then was both started laughing.         I don't know why but @CAPS1 just pulled on her head and her head was no longer stuck. The was like ten pieces of her hair stuck in the car door. She looked at the seat and said we have to tell her grandma about it. I didn't want her to be mad at me cause her seats were white. I thought it would stain. But we ended up telling her. She told us to go get napkins from the bathroom. The whole time we were going to the bath room me and @CAPS1 were just laughing so hard. We cleaned up the mess and I didn't get in trouble.         I guess that I have never peed my pants laughing but I almost did that day. After that day me and my best friend @CAPS1 always laugh at that story. I am so glad we went on an old people @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club trip.                       ,15.0,20.0,,35.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,12,,": The essay has a clear main idea and supporting details.

21193,8," For a year and two months I'd devoted my life to horses, school, and @CAPS1. We started off as friends in @CAPS2 grade, and it escalated to a relationship in @LOCATION1 grade. We ended up breaking up later on that year, but we continued to remain 'friends'. Obviously I still cared for @CAPS1, but I didn't believe he'd felt the same. But apparently I was wrong, we began a new relationship on @DATE1 at @NUM1 pm.    It was the perfect start to our 'perfect relationship'. He and I were inseperable from the get go, we literally did everything together. I was @PERCENT1 irrevocably in love with @CAPS1. Between the two of us, we shared some crazy memories and inside jokes. I could probably write a best selling novel of all the memories we had, and I honestly believed that @CAPS1 and I were going to be together forever. I thought everythign was going fine, till he had to lay it out, he liked someone else.   At that point, I had no idea where our relationship (or I) stood. I didn't want to know. I couldnt keep putting my heart in the open if it was going to get stomped on, but I loved @CAPS1 and was willing to do anything to make it work. I stayed the night with @CAPS1, and we talked till @NUM2. He and I decided to attempt to make it work, but there was no guarantee it was going to.     The next day, everything seemed fine. I was still extremely irritated that he liked another girl, but I was using all my power to make the best of what we had. We decidded to take his dog, @CAPS3, on a walk. We held hands as we walked, but it was too quiet. Why? He was texting @CAPS4. By that time, I decided that was the final straw. It felt like I was getting in the way, so I felt that the only choice I had left was to leave @CAPS1.  I walked in the door an hour later absolutely devistated. I cried till I felt I couldn't cry anymore, and then I would cry more. At the time, I truly felt that the world was ending right before me. My life was over. My days became long and depressing, and I felt that all I could do was give up. My heart shattered everytime I saw @CAPS1, and it made it even worse when people constantly asked about what had happened. I couldn't tell them, it wasn't a moment I would want to relive. I couldn't stop thinking about @CAPS1, and about all the memories we'd shared. That year and two months has been the greatest period of my life.   Almost everytime I thought about @CAPS1 I would cry. I couldn't stand the thought of not having @CAPS1, and thinking about @CAPS1 all the time made me into a walking zombie. I couldn't eat, I couldn't drink, and I would vomit because of the stress. But as I sat there in alone thinking of the memories, a miracle happened: I laughed. I was shocked, but it made me realize that I needed to keep living. I don't regret any of the time I spent with @CAPS1, he changed my life. He taught me so much about loving someone. I knew from that small laugh, that things were going to get better. A spark of hope, I would be happy again. ",15.0,20.0,40.0,40.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,,,":**

21194,8," The word (laughter) @MONTH1 mean a smile or something nice that has happened to someone or even a thank you, but for many people it means the action or sound of laughing. For many people the felling they get inside when they laugh is the felling of happiness. The sense of felling good inside is the meaning that ones in while you have to be happy in life; have a balance in your life. For me the word (laughter) means being happy and the felling of doing something good in life. For instance when a couple get married they need a sense of laughter in there life's so they can enjoy their companies. It was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2 early in the morning I was extremely exited to leave because that was the day I was going to go visit my grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncle, and cousins that I had not seen for about eight years. I remember that morning I felt a sense of happiness and sadness at the same time.I was about to leave for two months in a half I was going to miss my family and friends, but at the same time I felt happy and exited to go. That morning we arrived at the air port; I was about to ride on my very first airplane. As I tried to find my seat through the big line of people that were finding their seats as well; I sat down and buckled my self into the seat and looked out the window and all over the place. My stomach was turning in circles round and round and I had the felling of a roller coaster about to take off really fast. The next thing I knew the plane was moving I got kinda of scared, but at the same time I was excited.  During the flight I felt a sense of laughter in my soul; the memories of a childhood in @LOCATION2 were turning my emotions into laughter and tears that made me fell good I had never felt. The idea of seeing all my family and friend was captivate to my hear and emotions. As we arrived at the @LOCATION1 airport; my emotions were turning in circles back and forth. We only had two more flights left to get to our destinations. I was getting tired and sleepy, my legs and arm's hurt so bad, they felt like if you were caring two big bags of potatoes on each side of my leg and arms . We decided go eat some place as we walked around to see what we could find to eat we found pizza huts. The next thing I knew was that we had only one hour our to the next flight, so we agreed to head to our next flight. As we arrived to the gate people were already going in through the hallway to get into the plane so we hurried. Three hours past buy and we had landed in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 that was our destination. I felt a sense of laughter inside of me as we waited for our ride home; the feeling I got was as if someone had token something from me and gave it back. I started to cry at that moment, but at the same time I was laughing. We arrived that late afternoon to my grandparents house, as I looked at them I felt a happy inside, they were happy as well. we decided to spend the @TIME1 over at my grandparents house, that @TIME1 nobody had gone to sleep every one was to busy talking with each other and catching up. The next day every one was tired and sleepy, but they were all happy and full of laughter inside.  We had spent a mouth in a half with family members that I had not seen in a while we all felt happy and with a sense of laughter inside. Everyone had an incredible time catching up with family and friend. We did not get to do all the things we wanted to, but the best part was the time I has with my family and friends. The word laughter to me mean the best thing that has happens to you and makes you fell good inside, or even the memories you think about when you are alone and sad, those are the memories that will make you laugh and fell good about yourself. Other people @MONTH1 say that laughter is the felling you get when you laugh, but laughter is the best felling in the world when you are happy. In this part of my life laughter was an important element of my whole life and it still is a great part in my life. Over many generations people have used the benefits of laughter in their life's for instance many famous and non- famous people, important people or non- important. Many people say that when you are not happy you are going to die not knowing what happy is. People really enjoy those moments that they spend with a special someone.",22.0,20.0,,42.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,":** The essay is clear and focused.

21195,8," There will always be moments in your life when your emotions will take control and motivate you. whether your happy, sad, angry or frustrated. At times like this I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @PERSON1 looked at me with her big blue eyes, they were swelled up with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt me deeply to see her go after five years of friendship but, we had postponed this moment long enough. There the boxes sat waiting, each with their own label, they had all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today that would be hard though. After we put @PERSON1's stuff in the moving van I noticed her dog, @PERSON2 wasn't outside like he normally is. When I went inside I found out he hadn't been hiding in there either. This was strange because @PERSON2 was the type of dog that liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @PERSON1 that @PERSON2 was missing, we went to look for him.    It was @DATE1 time, my favorite time of year and the sun felt warm against my skin. I remember this moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I would want to savor. As we walked along @PERSON1 and I talked about all sorts of things, this made me almost forget she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shinny silver object laying in the ground, from where I was standing I couldn't quite read what the engrave stated but I could see the one letter that said it all, the letter @CAPS1. It was @PERSON2's red and blue collar, I reached down and picked it up I figured he must be somewhere near. Fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw @PERSON2 riding in the back of someones old @ORGANIZATION1 truck. We started running after that truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, ""@CAPS2! Finally the truck stopped in front of our local store, the guy stepped out and he seemed aggravated with us.""That's my dog."" @PERSON1 stated, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at @LOCATION1. His face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @PERSON2 beside us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would take place when we arrived back at @LOCATION2's house. That night I stayed up thinking about @PERSON1 and @LOCATION1, I was great full to that dog for running off so we could spend more time together. Also I was thinking that maybe he had a reason for leaving, maybe he knew that we weren't ready to say goodbye and we had to have one last adventure, one last laugh. When we laughed together for the last time that day, I knew that we would truly be friends forever no matter if she lived near or far.",20.0,18.0,36.0,36.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21198,8,"  On the year of @DATE1, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house. with great to loving parents. we had a nice big back yard, my brother and I loved that the most. @CAPS1 was down stars making my brother and i school lunches for school. It was my brothers first day of school and he was so happy. I mean its his birthday and he also starts school on the same day, thats awsome. @CAPS1 let my brother walk to school with me, it was only down the road. The school my brother and i went to is called @LOCATION1. When we got to the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School to me didn't seem that bad but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue ether. Yeah my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. When I was on my way to the office I say him through the window. He turned his head and smilled, I could see all the glue still wet and it's everywhere.  My brother and me always had a good relationship, we both mad each other laugh all the time. If my brother and I didn't laugh at each other, we probable wouldn't talk to each other. Laughter to me is a very importent part to any kind of relationship. It alows poth people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of sence of humor you have.  As we approched the house, we saw @CAPS1 sitting on the porch waitting for us. After we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday. @CAPS1 had my brother do the dishes, and I do the vacuming in the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people dont come over. @CAPS1 said the whole family was coming over. My brother and i were so happy, we both new grandma was coming. When everyone got here we both were very happy. Grandma showed up alittle after dad did. @CAPS1 was in such a hurry, she wanted to see my brothers face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on are birthdays. When my brother was at the table @CAPS1 brang in the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make his day any happier.  When the birthday cake was over and the presients, my brother and i went out to the back yard to play kickball. My brother wouldnt use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play with. @CAPS1 and grandma were watching us play, we both were having fun. We laught every time I kicked the ball wrong, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball I got an idea. I wound my leg back and as the ball came close i kicked it. I kicked the ball so hard and so fast, insted of the ball going to his feet it went to his head. When the ball conected to his head he did a back flip off the ground. @CAPS1 and grandma were in aw, i was frozen still. When he got up he looked straight at me and laught. @CAPS1 started to laugh so did grandma, i was still frozen. I finaily went with it and by the time I started i couldnt stop. it was so funny, he got pickup off the ground and hit in the head with a ball and still laughs.   When it was time for everyone to go, @CAPS1 said her good byes and then it was grandmas turn. Grandma gave my brother the first kiss on the forhead than me. As grandma was leaving my brother and i sat on moms lap and gave her a big hug and said ""I love you @CAPS1"". @CAPS1 was tcking us in bed and was about to leave when my brother said "" @CAPS1 my head hurts"". I love my family and even today we look back on this and laugh. This has been a joy to write i hope you think so to.

21199,8," Laughter, what is the meaning; to show mirth, joy, or scorn with a chuckle or explosive vocal sound. People without laughter in there life go through stages of depression or feel a sadness inside them; they never seem to be able to find the light at the end of the tunnel, ""the light being happiness."" The days @MONTH1 turn into to months or even years, life seems to be at a standstill.  When you feel there is no happiness you begin to have doubts on your decisions in life; the choices you have made in life seem to all be wrong. This is what my life felt like when the world turned around and I found out my best friend just flipped her car. I was traumatized, in shock; I didn't know so many things could rush through your head in that given moment. I instantly started to ask a million questions to see if she was okay. All they could share with me at the time was that she was being rushed to the hospital. All I could do once I got home was lay in my bed and think; what could I have done so she would not have been in that car-- all i felt was guilt! That night was wretched my mind just kept wrapping around all the times my best friend and I spent together, the laughter we shared between each other, stupid fights, and all the dumb pranks. What was eating at me most though was we had gotten in a fight not to long before she wrecked; the worst part was it was over the stupidest thing. I had got irritated at her for constantly ditching out on our plans we had together to go spend time with her boyfriend. Now that I look back at it, all I felt was jealousy. If only I could take it all back, then maybe she would not have been distracted while she was driving and missed her turn. That next morning her mother called me and said ""she is asking for you, you @MONTH1 come to the hospital and see her if you please."" I was ecstatic, I got ready faster than I ever have before; within a few minutes I was ready and in my pick-up driving myself to the @LOCATION1 hospital. It only took me thirty-five minutes to get there, when it should take you around forty -five. I instantly jumped out of my truck, rushed into the hospital and went to the check-in desk to see what room she would be in. They told me she was in room @NUM1 right down the hall on the left. I got to room @NUM1, there was a crack in the door so I peeked in before trying to open the door the rest of the way; I finally got the confidence to open the door and go talk to her. She instantly had a smile on her face when she saw me, I pulled up a chair and sat right next to her. We talked for about an hour just about random things; including the wreck. She told me she had a few broken rips and a minor concussion, so she should be able to be out by that afternoon. When she told me that, I was one of the happiest people right at that moment. All I could do was laugh when she told me everything was fine; almost like laughter of relief. It did not take long before both of us started laughing, most of it was out of excitement and having nothing else to say; except the beautiful sound of laughter coming out of our mouths. I have to say it felt good just to be by my friends side again being able to share happy moments with each other. So what is the meaning of Laughter to me; shall you ask? It is the most meaningful thing that anyone could possible do. Laughter is to show signs of happiness, a giggle or an outburst; sharing unforgettable moments with a loved one.Without laughter your life can not be complete, make jokes, just laugh make life have meaning again. Do not go through life being @PERSON2, instead be @PERSON1. Go ahead test it out and see what laughter can do for you in your life!",18.0,17.0,,35.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21200,8," @CAPS4 whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all @CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross @CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON1's always been there for us. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrival, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON2. @CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" @CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @CAPS6 laughed. ""@CAPS2 isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""@CAPS3, I... what happened?"" @CAPS4 face was too buried in @CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so @PERSON2 took over, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" @CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS4 body became. ""@CAPS7,"" glancing over at @PERSON2, I smiled, ""@CAPS6 was really cute,"" I cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!"" @CAPS4 cousin laughed; @CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against @CAPS4 inner stomach, and I laughed as @CAPS3. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of @CAPS2, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought @CAPS4 cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together.",15.0,22.0,40.0,40.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5,,,": The writing is clear, focused, and interesting.

21202,8,"Warm @CAPS1 Laughter @MONTH1 be the best medicine, but it @MONTH1 also be the best glue. When one laughs, especially with another, it brings a sense of relaxation and happiness. Laughter is a release of amusement, and that literally means ""not thinking"". In this moment, people open themselves up and it brings a warm feeling of the heart that is shared between each other. Without this connection or ability to jest, people begin to think too much and become overly critical about relationships. To flirt is to make fun or light of a situation, the point of this is to put people at ease so they @MONTH1 open up. Flirting can consist of many things, such as joking, impressing, or complementing; usually this leads to laughing or excessive giggling. When this warming connection begins, so does the bond between the people, such as it was with my own girlfriend. I just came off the back end of a hurtful experience with another girl, so I had become tough at heart. I was a bit of a nervous kid, so when she started to be pleasant and kind to me, I started to grow out of my shell and laugh with her. Our first date was to see some silly yo-yo man who had come to their church. It was a great way to start off what we have been building now for two years, as well as comfortable setting to meet the parents.   Sometimes the key to opening up, or bonding, is to make a fool of oneself. It's hard to laugh with someone who is being prideful or too analytical; laughter is a crucial mental break from routine thinking. Being a dork @MONTH1 just be the best way to be in a healthy relationship. My relationship is very well balanced between supporting each other, being critical, and being idiots. I take sacrifices to make her laugh, and she does the same for me, but mostly this results in both of us being profusely happy and laughing together. Being a man is not the same as being stubborn or powerful, I feel it's more about being open and compassionate. To be open enough to have someone to laugh with, one has to be able to laugh at themselves. Laughter is an @CAPS2, a socially transforming device, and it spreads rapidly.  The same goes for a simple social gathering. Does anyone become the ""life of the party"" without laughing at themselves? They are typically the ones going out of their way to be ridiculous for everyone else to see, because once it starts, it spreads exponentially. Being comfortable is the foundation of having a good time, otherwise people are acting paranoid, refuse to participate, and downright seem cold. Laughter's bright tone is a good way to get people comfortable and relaxed. Think of people as @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is difficult to pour and spread around when it's cold, it's thick and condensed. You can't do much with cold @CAPS1, so you have to warm it up. One can't heat @CAPS1 up in a flash or else it could become tasteless, but once it is gradually heated it becomes easy to spread and very useful. This warm @CAPS1 is quick to mix with about anything and sticks to things all the same. My relationship has been sticky, sweet, and warming beyond compare, but nothing without a little work, or a little laughter.

21203,8,"         The @CAPS1 and Benefits of @CAPS2 is really an important thing in life. Laughter lightens mood and makes you feel more happy. If people laugh more often their days are more happier, lighter and much more shorter. Little children are the ones who laugh more often. Making adults laugh is not very easy because they are more serious. There are a lot of stories that laughter is the important element. Laughter can connect with many other nice elements, such as being glad or happy. I have once read a story about a little girl named @CAPS3 who liked to make people glad. And through gladness, people were made to laugh more often. And through laughter, the sick people became healthier and stopped being sick. Laughter consists of many different factors. For example, being glad leads to laughing more, being happy, and of course smiling more. When you are felling down and some stranger for example smiles to you, you feel happier and maybe your mood is going to lighten. The morning dawned to be gray and rainy. The people of the household woke up irritable and grumpy. Everything was going up-side down. No one was smiling. The breakfast was a very monotonous one, because no one felt like talking. It seemed that the day is going to end like this.  @CAPS4 was also very grumpy this day. She didn't want to go to school at all. She was mad at everyone and everything. She was mad at rain. Rain was her worst enemy because then she couldn't go out for a walk with her friends. She was mad at her maid because she has forgotten to fill her pitcher with warm water, as she always did. She was mad at her little sister for taking her blue hair ribbons. To tell the truth, she was mad at everyone, and she has not even thought that if she had been more happier today, then everything will seem okay. Well, so, she still had to go to school, wanted she or not.  At school, the little teacher was merry as usual. She wasn't a bit grumpy, even if it was a rainy and gloomy day. Some of the student had the same mood as the teacher, but there were very few of them. The school work seemed endless to @CAPS4, especially her mathematics. But everything changed after the teacher has told everyone that it was story time. The story was about a little orphan girl who had to go live with her mean relatives. But she wasn't at all affected by their moods. She was very simple and always happy. Over a period of time, the people she was visiting (especially the sick and old) begin to be happy, just like her. And when she had to go away from that village, everyone was sad to see her go. With lightness of heart and being happy, the girl has left the most precious gift, being always happy which led to laughter more often. Even when she was gone, a passing stranger might always hear happiness and laughter. And it was even enjoyable to stay in that place a little while before continuing your journey. Because the passer-by's always felt themselves feeling much better in health, because of laughing. After the teacher has finished the story, @CAPS4 thought, why wouldn't she try to cheer her family up? Even though it was raining, it didn't mean that everyone should be gloomy. So after the school was finished, @CAPS4 ran home to cheer everyone up. In the @TIME1, when everyone was finished with their day's tasks and relaxing, there was laughter heard through the windows. Seems like @CAPS4 has found a way to lead laughter into her household too. The story she had heard earlier in the day has helped her today, and all through her long life. She has remembered this special rule of home happiness. And always in her home there was happiness and laughter even on really gloomy and dark days. We can see that this small factor, which doesn't seem to big @CAPS1 to us has made @CAPS4's life more happy. I hope that this little factor can help you too.",19.0,20.0,40.0,40.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,,,":**

21204,8," It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1 so I was nervous about the new school just like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked out @CAPS4 surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria was about four tables with around @NUM1 people at each one, but it wasn'@CAPS5 the fact that they were there that caught @CAPS4 attention it was what they were doing. They were dueling with @CAPS1-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria where all could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit cause everyone in @CAPS4 school stopped dueling, and here I am looking at at least @NUM2 highschoolers just dueling away. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all judge. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named @PERSON1 (who later has become one of @CAPS4 best friends.) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day thinking ""I'm gonna get back into that game!"". So I bought a deck, and continued @CAPS4 recon of the tables, @CAPS4 deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge it's master. A few days went by as I continued @CAPS4 silent observation of the duelists. Finally a duelist named @CAPS5.J (another one of @CAPS4 now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick @CAPS4 butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. @PERSON1 then taught me he how to play better and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I cant hang around him without laughing. Through him I have met tons of great friends. Even now I wonder what @CAPS4 high school life would be like if they didn'@CAPS5 attend @CAPS4 new school.",16.0,15.0,,31.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The essay is clear and focused.

As I was about to finish I had realized I was late for school I was only I @NUM1 grade so I ran got dressed and told my sisters to @CAPS5 and get ready but you no how girls can be putting @CAPS4 there make-@CAPS6 and doing there hair.      My sister @PERSON2 was in @NUM2 grade and my other sister was in @NUM3 grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were @CAPS4 our way heading off to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher @PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only liked her was because when we were cleaning our desk she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book and the book was by ""@CAPS1 foul"" I can't recall the name but I remember the cover was gold an was about ghouls and monsters the way she read it was like if we were there that book was so intense even tho i really didn't understand it. Next she would give us a math worksheet I know right math in @NUM1 grade but I was really smart at math and she would always pick @CAPS4 me and give me harder math then others and when I asked her why I was getting harder math then the other kids she had told me I was different. I new I was smarter then some kids but not all so I never knew if that was a complement or an insult but I really didn't care. So now that we got that out of the way we can get to the fun part were all the laughter is so school is over right and I'm trying to find my sister to walk me home, after @NUM5 min looking for i find her walking to the cross walk I yell her name ""@CAPS2"". She looks and I'm running to her and her friends as you no she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother so she ran across the street.   My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me and I was in a @CAPS5 to get to the car and I had to wait for the cross guard lady to @CAPS3 to me. At last she finally had noticed me, I was @CAPS4 walking in an hurried past to get to the car because I had herd my dad yelling ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6""so I was walking faster and faster and as I was walking I herd from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed it was it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner nearly hit the cross guard lady, the car had hit the crossing stick the out of no were I was hit flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised cuts every were my dad was panicking ran out of the car screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information license plate number.    As I was laying @CAPS4 the ground my dad came to me and was trying to get me @CAPS6 he pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember I had my scooby-doo underwear @CAPS4 and every one was staring at me I was more embarrassed then hurt I didn't feel the pain until the next day so I was all good I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and every one was laughing at me because they saw my underwear @CAPS4 and my dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have trouble doing sports because i have a fractured hip. i was living the dream my sisters were spoiling me giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream and @CAPS4 top of that I couldn't feel the pain. Bu t the fireman said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did and my mean old teacher saw me and i was limping and what she told me got me mad she had told me to ""stop faking it"".

21207,8," My knees were weak and my hands were slightly shaking as my rapid heartbeat was causing my breathing to increase speed and time. I wanted to get this over with, but at the same time, I hadn't the intentions to ever start a conversation, yet alone, @CAPS3 him. It had been a whole @DATE1 since I had seen my dad and I wasn't sure whether to expect a relaxed, laid back man, or an uptight, cranky one. So, I closed my eyes, took deep breaths, and decided to put this in the hands of @CAPS1. It was obvious that once I saw my dad, it would be a natural thing to talk to him, but I suspicious of his mood and if it would affect mine at all! If for any reason this did happen for the worse, we probably wouldn't be the best of friends for a matter of weeks. He'd then continue to pull the, ""@CAPS2 think now that @CAPS2're a teenager, @CAPS2 can do and act however @CAPS2 want?"" Or the, ""I'm your father, I deserve more respect!"" @CAPS3, the funny thing is, I never start any of these things. He chooses to start them when he's bored, I guess. Then, he continues to make me feel bad for his wrongdoings.  When my mother, sister and I arrived at the airport, (I'm not going to lie) I wanted to go home. My sister would crack a few jokes here and there and my mother would let her wittiness shine on me; even in the mist of all of this, they could only get a small giggle out of me because I let my nerves get the best of me. I didn't want my past three months of @DATE1 to be ruined by his coming home. But once I looked back at all I had done: two weeks in @LOCATION1, rafting, etc., I realized that I did miss him and did want him back. Don't get me wrong, my dad is a super nice, funny, and hardworking guy, it's just hard to work with him sometimes.  My dad's flight had landed, and after a solid hour of waiting for him, he came out of the airplane. We could @CAPS3 his eyes frantically scouring the airport for us, and when he found us, he gave the warmest, friendliest smile I had ever seen upon his face. Tears welded up in his eyes as my sister raced for him and my mom quickly walked behind. My legs carried me toward him and I soon found that my sister and I were competing to be the first to hug him! One hundred feet never felt so close yet so far away. Panting, we reached him with heavy legs and full hearts, now that we were with him.  The good thing is, an awkward moment never appeared. It knocked, but we didn't let it come through the door ; instead laughter came in its place. All of my troubles and worries were gone when he opened his mouth, and those soothing waves of laughter came out and were welcomed into our ears. My heart was lifted and my smile brightened. I knew that my father could not have been gone any longer. I love him! Laughter soothes the soul and brings joy to any situation. It is kind and has no regrets. The only mistake is not taking the chance to laugh in the first place. Laughter is one of the many things that holds me so close to my father today. Our sense of humor when we're together is never dull and is unforgettable. I trust him with my life and ever since I was born, he has found a way to make the best out of every situation by laughter. @CAPS2 can count on his laugh to make anyone smile and it is without a doubt, the most contagious thing @CAPS2'll ever hear.

21208,8," The first day I met her, I knew @CAPS4 was the right dog for me. Her black and white fur was as soft as cotton, and her eyes as brown as the bark on a tree. @CAPS4 had a genuine personality no other dog could possess. Which was something I could tell right away @CAPS4 was the dog for me. Over the next couple of months, our friendship grew, as I taught her to talk, smile, and stand on two legs and dance with me. A black lab @PERSON1, instantly became her best friend, as the two ran over the property barking and playing. Everynight the two would cuddle up next to eachother and sleep. The times @CAPS1 (my new dog) would lay on her side and relax, I would call her an oreo. Her middle belly was white and her sides were black, making her look like a large-breathing oreo @CAPS1. @CAPS5 her name had come from. The seventh month had came along fast, but it was enjoyable every day with my @CAPS1 at my side.@CAPS4 gave me the best comfort when I needed it, always giving me a smile when the day was rainy, or sleeping next to me when I didnt feel the best. It was kind of like @CAPS4 was my own special dose of medicine, her presence made me feel well again. Her love had grown deep into all of our hearts at that house and @CAPS4 was one of a kind, but something began to change about her as the days went on. Her food bowl would be nearly full everytime we fed her, @CAPS4 wouldnt run with @PERSON1 anymore, @CAPS4 wouldnt talk, and @CAPS4 wouldnt smile. I knew something was wrong. We didnt know @CAPS4 was sick until it was too late. The first day @CAPS4 had thrown up blood. That was when the worrying began between my boyfriend, his mother, and I. We wanted to find a vet to help her, but none of us had the money to do it. The second day in the @TIME1, I couldnt find @CAPS1 anywhere on the property. I thought that maybe @CAPS4 had just gone for a walk around the outskirts of the house, until it reached @NUM1 pm and there was still no sign of her. Panick spread throughout my body and I gave up looking for her and turned towards @PERSON1. ""@PERSON1,"" I looked at her straight into her eyes, ""I know you can hear me."" @CAPS4 looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged her tail. ""@CAPS5 is @CAPS1, @PERSON1?"" I knew @CAPS4 understood me as @CAPS4 began to sniff around the areas of the property and suddenly as if @CAPS4 had picked up a trace, had followed a line of scent to an old opal car. @PERSON1 wagged her tail looked at me and looked back under the car. There @CAPS1 was sick looking. So I pulled her back up onto the property for my boyfriends mother to look at her. We werent sure if it was poisoning or something else. So we called a animal expert and asked. @CAPS4 said it sounded most likely like parvo, since we hadnt gotten @CAPS1 her parvo shot yet. So over the night to help her feel better, I and my boyfriend stayed up shooting water into her dehydrated body, and spinach juice hoping it would help, but all @CAPS4 wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone in peace and decided we would check up on her in the @TIME1. In the @TIME1 my boyfriend had to go to work and I was left alone with @CAPS1 to take care of her. I sang songs to her as @CAPS4 layed on the porch sad looking and in despair, I stroked her on her head telling her how much @CAPS4 was my best friend and my favorite dog that meant so much to me, and I told her I loved her. I tried getting her to eat but @CAPS4 would only puke it back up. Finally after a day of crying next to her I noticed @CAPS4 kept walking to the pond behind the house and sitting in it. It gave me the insentive to check her butt. As I pulled up her tail, i noticed a large bloody hole @CAPS5 flies were flying out of. @CAPS4 was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down or not, and I, my boyfriend, and his father just looked at her watching her be in pain. It was time. As soon as we got to the vet office, they took her inside and layed her on a table @CAPS5 I was told to hold onto her as they shot an overdose of anasthesia into her. it was only seconds before @CAPS4 was gone and everyone in the room was silent and I cried over her limp no longer smiling body.  We dug a hole and buried her under the tree @CAPS4 played under. ""@CAPS1 my mama bear. @NUM2 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 you in heaven.""",23.0,18.0,38.0,38.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3,,,":**

21209,8,"Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY1 @CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS18 the day of @CAPS7 tenth birthday @CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. So after @CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS7 cousins wedding was this @DATE1 and that we might have time after to @CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS7 cousins wedding @CAPS7 dad said ""@CAPS6 go fishing."" @CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""@CAPS8 dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly"". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole siting @CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS7 new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to @CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this @CAPS13 @CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS7 right and said to @CAPS7 dad ""@CAPS15 not lose @CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS18."" @CAPS7 dad reply's ""@CAPS17, @CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already."" @CAPS18 @CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS19 that had landed near @CAPS7 fishing line. @CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH1 ask? It was @CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM1 maybe @NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS7 dad looked @CAPS18 shore for something to pull @CAPS7 pole in with but to @CAPS7 surprise he found it @CAPS18 shore down river.Will @CAPS20",20.0,22.0,,42.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

21210,8," @DATE1 my birthday, my boyfriend @PERSON2 took me to @LOCATION1 to @ORGANIZATION2's. I had never been there it was exciting and a new food experience for me. My dad had promised me that he would take me because it was my @NUM1 birthday and he wasn't there for my @NUM2 birthday. But he forgot so my dads girlfriend called the restaurant and told the manager that it was my birthday and to give me anything that i wanted and just to charge it on her credit card. This is where mine and @PERSON2's adventure started..  The beging of our adventure. Driving on the old back roads of @CAPS1 in the old @ORGANIZATION1 on our way to @LOCATION1. Just @PERSON2 and I, the roads were damp with the mid-afternoon dew, the trees with their beautiful leaves of all different color's of red's, green's, and orange. Bouncing around from the dips in the old road. @NUM3 bumpin on the stereo, only singing the parts we know. When we got to @CAPS2 we got lost because we took the wrong exit and ended up in @LOCATION2 the other side of where we were supposed to be. Being lost in a way bigger city than @PERSON1 or @CAPS1 wasn't good, We had no clue where we were.  First place we go to was a strip mall that had a big party store. we go inside and theirs @CAPS4 decorations as far as the eye could see. Monster's, whitche's, and goblin's. We got side tracked by all the scary things I realized that I had to go to the bathroom. While I went to the bathroom @PERSON2 asked one of the store clerks where we could find this @CAPS5. The guy tells us hes never heard of a place like that. So we got back into the @ORGANIZATION1, there was a lady getting out of her car so we asked her. She said yeah its just down a couple of streets. As we drive down the highway we couldn't find it anywhere. Somehow we are lost all over again so we find another covenant store up this really big hill. we didn't think that the little @ORGANIZATION1 could make it up such a big hill. We made it to the top, went inside and had the clerk look up on his phone were we needed to go. As we waited all I could think about was how bad my feet were hurting in those shoes. We got the address and took off again for our search.   About twenty minutes later we still had no luck at finding this restaurant and to top it off we had a reservation so we couldn't be late. We find another covenant store and @PERSON2 ran in to ask. The clerk told us to get back on the highway I was like no no stay on this road. We followed the empty road and right around the corner there it was @CAPS5. We were happy to have found it finally and we weren't even late. All @PERSON2 and I could do was laugh because we had gotten so frustrated to find the stupid place that it was just so funny you couldn't help but not to laugh. It brought @PERSON2 and I just that much closer we had gotten through that by laughing instead of fighting. And that we our funny adventure story.

21211,8,"Ever since I was born laughter has been a big part of my life without it I would be a very boring and grumpy person. Even tough I have experienced many moments full of laughter one specific moment always comes to mind. About a year ago my mom and I went on a trip down to @LOCATION1 to visit her family. It was the first time we had been there in over twelve years because my mom and I could not go visit them do to immigration problems. After all toughs years had past by my mom and I managed to get our legal residency in the united states. As soon as we got the residency we were free and could go visit her family without having to come back illegally. When my mom and I got to the airport in @LOCATION1 my mom started crying because she was full of emotions, for the first time in twelve years she was going to see her mom, dad, brothers, and sisters. As soon as we had gone trough all the airport security and baggage claim we made our way out to the exit where my grandpa had agreed to pick us up. When we got outside the airport a small little red @ORGANIZATION1 started getting closer and closer driving towards my mom and I. The car was no further then forty feet away when my mom suddenly dropped her luggage and started running toward the small red car I had no idea who the elderly person driving the car was. When the car parked an aged man stepped out of the vehicle and gave my mom one of the longest and most emotional hugs I had ever experienced in my entire life they must of been hugging for at least fifteen minutes just crying on each-others shoulders. When they had finished hugging my mom calls out my name and I start walking toward her. When I was face to face with my mom and the older man my mom tells me that the man was my grandfather then she looks at her dad and tells him to meet his grandson. For the first time in a very long time I had a grandfather I stood in shock for a while and so did he. He was amazed of how big and how much I had changed in toughs long twelve years that he had gone without seeing me or having contact with me. When I reached out to hug him he griped me hard and didn't let go he told me that this day had been the happiest day of his life.  Me and my grandpa started loading the luggage into his car so we could head home to meet the rest of my family. When we got done loading everything into the car we headed home. The long ride home was a bit weird and uncomfortable because there wasn't much talk in the car. It was about a fifty minute ride home when we reached our destination in a small little town out of the @LOCATION1 called texcoco. It was a nice little clean town with a lot of small stores and lots of two story middle class houses the streets full of cars and people walking or on bicycles very different to what I was used to back in the united states. When we got to our house there was a group of about twenty people that were family and friends outside the gate waiting for us. When we were done seedling in and got done meeting all our relatives we got together and had a family dinner.

21213,8," Its my sophomore year and some of my friends were going to try out softball. After thinking about it I joined and I fell in love with this sport. I am not that good but like they say practice makes perfect. We all laugh and have a good time and everyone likes everyone and its fun to be apart of a team that is always laughing and having a great time together. This is about a time when my friends and I started laughing so hard we almost started cried and now its one of our little joke between all of us girls. Once my friends and I were out catching pop fly's and it was my turn to go catch the ball. I went out there skipping and just being my normal weird self. They hit the ball and it started to come toward me and I went running for it and slipped and fell right on my butt. Everyone including me started laugh because I fell in the mud and got all dirty. About ten minutes later we all were standing there and talking about how funny it was when I fell and how it made everyone's day. Then I saw some mud on the ground and I wanted to roll in it but didn't want to just lay down and start rolling in mud. So I asked my friend @PERSON1 to push me into the mud so I could fall in and roll in it. After she pushed me into the mud I got up and started laughing my head off. My knees were covered in mud and so was my butt and legs. They all started to say who shied on you because we are not aloud to curse, so we made something else to replace it. Now when I walk in the hall ways and see someone from the softball team we both just start laughing and say who shied on you in the middle of what ever we are doing right then.  This is the first year I have ever played a sport in high school and I am glad I did it because I am having so much fun. When it ends in a few months I am going to be really upset. All these girls and I have became so close in the last @NUM1 weeks that they are like family to me now. Most of us use to just know each other and not really were friends and never talked at all but now we all do. We love to do silly things like sing in the locker room randomly or make the most dumbest jokes ever. But we all have fun and we don't care. We have had lots of laughs and many more to come this season. Like when we have games on the buses or just even at practice. We have an amazing couch that makes us laugh and makes jokes everyday. This season should be interesting with all of us because we all like to laugh and make joke and sing and just have a great time with each other and that's all that matters to make a good softball team and a great season.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,,,": The writing is clear and focused.

21214,8,"The Benefits of Laughter Laughter has always been a major part of my life. Most of the relationships that I have with my friends are great , because i can make them laugh and cheer them up when they feel down. When a person laughs it makes them completely forget about anything that brought them down, and now they just focus on what made them laugh and feel that joy and happiness. When you laugh , the only thing on your mind is the thing that made you laugh, nothing else. laughter in many cases has brought people from an absolute low self-esteem to a high self-esteem in a very short amount of time. An example in where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends. One of my good friends seemed to be really down and didn't want to talk about what was going on with anyone. With him not telling anyone what was wrong it kind of leaves you guessing, what could have happened? After about a week of pretty much isolating himself from others, he was ready to talk and hang out with some of his close friends, which included me. Me, and two other people that were friends with me and him, decided to go golfing which was a new hobby of ours. It was that day that he told us how his mom was cheating on his dad for over a year, and how she was also hiding alcohol in all different kinds of places. and was over-drinking.  By him just being around his friends, laughing and having a good time, he found himself focusing on other things other than what was going wrong in his life. Even laughing at yourself can be a good way of coping with your problems. even when there seems that nothing will go right in your life, something always will, you just have to give it time. The moral of the story that i have just told is that no matter how sad you feel, laughter can always help ease the pain. Even laughing about a bad situation could help you to feel better.

21215,8," Laughter is huge part of everyone's life. It's used to express several different emotions. It's used to bridge the gap between people and break the awkward barrier. People laugh at their own mistakes which show others that they too make mistakes.  Some people can communicate through laughter and know what the other is feeling. For instance one time while i was on a long car ride and very bored and about to fall asleep. So out of no where I began laughing with my friend and laughing different ways and carried on a whole conversation just with laughter. Laughing can bring others together by sharing common interests; everyone laughs. I laugh more than others I'm sure of it. Laughter is a huge part of my life, honestly with out it my life would be boring and depressing. I laugh so much sometimes that my side and stomach hurts so bad. I also make a lot of mistakes and am very clumsy so i get laughed at a lot. My family is a very close and hilarious family we make a lot of mistakes constantly everyday. For my great grandma's @DATE1 we were planning a surprise party. While we were planning it my grandma kept getting suspicious and asking what we were doing. So we kept telling her that we were going to get her a stripper for her @DATE1. So we managed to talk my uncle bobby into being a stripper and climbing out of a box and so he did and it ended up scaring my grandma. Until this day we still talk about that day and laugh about it all the time. Everyday my aunt acts in a ridiculous and funny way and so most of the time i laugh at her. She is always dancing at music on commercials or singing opera. My great grandma always eats foods that make her pass gas, and it's hilarious because sometimes she doesn't even realize that she is doing it. My great grandma also likes to dance and it also hilarious because the dance moves that she knows are far different then the ones today. I believe that with out laughter my family would not be as close as we are. With out laughter i would not be as close to my friends. You can bond over laughter it sometimes forces you to ask questions and get to know people in other ways you would not. It makes you comfortable around people and able to share things and act silly and not worry about your appearance. Laughter can also change your emotion from mad to happy in an instance. For example i was riding dirt bikes with my younger cousin and he decided that he wanted to go through this swamp with his bike. I told him it wasn't very wise because i knew it was not possible for him to go through there with out getting stuck and yet he tried it anyway. So as i assumed he got the bike stuck and since i was the only one with him i had to help him get the bike unstuck. It took forever for us to get the bike out. As soon as we did he tried to drive through again and got it stuck yet another time. I was very upset with my cousin but as i was getting ready to yell and leave him he fell in the mud head first and it instantly changed my mood. Even still today i laugh about the matter even though i didn't think it was very funny at the time.  Even though laughter is good it can also be bad; @CAPS1 laughing at others while they are hurt and crying, or laughing at stupid ignorant pranks, or even laughing at people while they are making bad decisions. Decisions @CAPS1 drinking, drunk people are funny but the fact of being drunk or drinking at all is not. You can actually influence people to make bad decisions by laughing at them. Laughing at them makes them think that it's @CAPS2 to do what they are doing because it is making others laugh. So laughter is healthy but it is also unhealthy in a way.",21.0,20.0,,41.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21217,8,"So my friends and i got into a heated discusion on how we need to keep things to our selves cause one of my friends told people some personal things about us. He caused us allot of problems in school and around town, @CAPS1 he started to lie to us one of my other friends lost it and went after him and tackled him down told him to quite lying. By the time he let him up and we all got back in are seats he started to spill his guts to us, he told us some rumers he started about us and some other things he did we kinda all lost it. So we calmed down a little then took turns talking to him, after my two friends talked it was my turn i was talking to him and he kept interupting me, finally i got mad and i grabed something off the floor to throw at him. Don't git me wrong not to hurt im to stop him from interupting me. I reached down grabed something soft without looking picked it up and threatened to throw it at him and he started to point and laugh, I stoped turned my head to look at what was in my hand. now remember it was an intense conversation you could cut the tension with a nife, for him to start laughing and everyone join in i didnt want to know. But i turned my head looked and fell over laughing it was a stuffed fairy i picked up off his floor i did through it at him, but playfully. We all finally stoped laughing and sat back down.

21218,8," Every fiber of my being was urging me to talk to her, but my gut churned with anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do @CAPS6. Then she glanced at me. Just for a second, but enough to gather information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feeling her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. @CAPS5 girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus on not looking like a moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know i saw her smile, and it was at me! There was @PERSON1, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then @DATE1 came. The ice rink in @LOCATION1 was about @NUM1 minutes away, which seemed short because of the @NUM2 friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice.Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One-by-one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about @CAPS1 of @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and the various other games that held our interest.  But as usual that conversation turned into a debate about ""over powered classes"". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a @DATE2's breeze. Then as she looping around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before.  She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. ""@CAPS5 the sniper is @CAPS6 @LOCATION2, you don't know what you're talking about!""my friends sneered at one another. I had @CAPS5 interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards @PERSON2. As i approached her I was running one-liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her.  I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion seized, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All she could do was laugh along.",22.0,20.0,,42.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21219,8,"                  Laughter I have many friends. My friends and I are always doing silly things to have a good time, and pass the time. We are laughing all the time. There is not one day where we are together and we do not laugh. My friends and I believe that laughter is an essential element of life. One, blazing, @DATE1 day my friends, @PERSON2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON3 , all came over to my house. We were all bored, and hot, so we wanted to decide on something exciting to do. @LOCATION3 said, ""@CAPS1 don't we go swimming you guy's?"" We all agreed. My friends and I could not agree on where to go swimming though. We couldn't go to the pool near my house, because it was to crowded. We also, could not go to the lake, because it was too far, and we had no way to get there. My mother was working, so she could not give us a ride. @CAPS6 then said, ""I know you guy's! @CAPS1 don't we just have a water balloon fight right here at @CAPS2's house?"" We all responded, ""@CAPS3 let's do it!"" A little after, the @CAPS4 went to the store nearest by, which was @ORGANIZATION1, to buy water balloons, and water guns. Once they got back, they started filling them up right away. While us ladies changed into our bathing suits. After, we all decided on who was going to be on what team. The first team was @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and @LOCATION1. The second team, and the best team, was @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, and I. Both teams were all ready to go. Each team had buckets full of water balloons, and water guns. The teams were on different sides of my mom's green suburban. We were going to start throwing water balloons at the count of three, but the opposite team cheated and threw a water balloon before. Oh, but they did not realize that we had the hose on our side. @PERSON4 chased @PERSON1 across the yard. She caught up to her and soaked her with her water gun, but @PERSON1 threw a huge water balloon at her. It exploded right on her face. We all started laughing. Then, @PERSON2 and I started throwing water balloons at each other. We ran out, so we started using our water guns. Those too eventually ran out. @PERSON2 was all out of resources. I grabbed the hose, and I turned it up to full power. @PERSON2 tried to run but he slipped and fell. I completely hosed him down. My team had won the first @CAPS5. It was time for @CAPS5 two now. We had filled up more water balloons, refilled our water guns, and gone to our sides. We all counted, ""One! Two! Three!"" @CAPS5 two had started. @LOCATION3 started chasing @PERSON3. They went around the suburban at least five times before he caught up to her. He caught up to her on the grass. The grass was really slippery from when I got @CAPS6 wet, so they slipped, and fell down. @PERSON3 slipped first, but she took @LOCATION3 down with her when she was trying to get back up. We all started throwing water balloons at them, which made it harder for them to get up. @PERSON3 managed to get up she went on the side where her team was. They started throwing everything they had at us. They soaked us up. We had lost the second @CAPS5. Now it was time for the final @CAPS5. The @CAPS5 that decided who won, and who lost. We filled up double the water balloons, and double the water guns. No one got the hose that time. We thought it was not fair. Both teams lined up on different sides of my front yard. My team was on the right side, and the opposite team was on the left side. We were against who ever was lined up in front of us. I threw the first water balloon at @LOCATION1. Then @LOCATION3 threw at @PERSON2, and after @PERSON3 at @LOCATION2. Who ever moved out of line lost. @PERSON1 was the first to lose. @PERSON3 had thrown a big water balloon at her that knocked her out of line. We moved a step closer. It was now three against two. @LOCATION3 then water gunned @CAPS6 down. We walked another step closer. @PERSON4 and I were going back and forth at each other, but @PERSON4 had no more water balloons after a while and her water gun was empty so I beat her. We moved another step closer. @LOCATION3, and I easily soaked @PERSON3 down. My team had had won! We all cheered, then went back inside to dry off, and have some ice cream to celebrate my teams success. That day we proved that anyone can have a great time with some good friends, imagination, and a lot of laughter. I believe that everyone should laugh on regular basis. There is no need for sadness of anger in life.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21220,8," Well it all started with the day he came to the airport. Missing him so much hardly ever getting to see him or have him return your phone calls like a @CAPS2 brother should, but it is always a blessing t see him and have him over for the holidays its amazing how he found time during the @DATE1 to come and visit us. it was well fortunate because now i didn't have to hear him cry all the time on its too cold and wet out here. So it was pretty good but because it was the @DATE1 it was normally about the time i go out and hang out with my friends and girls and now that started talking to this really beautiful girl that lives right around the corner from my house i was dying to go out and be with her but since time was really short with him i had to put my @CAPS2 brother first before anything.But then again every chance i got man i left and sneaked away to go see her. she was so beautiful so funny man she was s perfect to me it was crazy like a dream. I would tell my brother all the time about her. He would always tell me even if she was real it was impossible for a girl to be like that. It was the first day he spent the night everybody was so happy in the house from the time we picked up from the airport to the drive home talking making jokes about how much he changed how tight his cloths are. It was good we even stopped at burger-vile to get a couple burgers cause fat boy was so hungry all the time non stop eating. We shortly arrived home and the look on my little brother and sisters face was priceless there mouths open so wide like if they just saw god. As they came running towards he wasn't so prepared for it slowly still putting his bags down by the door he gets tackled and ruined over by a @NUM1 year old girl and a @NUM2 year old boy it was funny seeing them so happy and excited it was a surprise for them we were only supposed to get gas ha ha ha. Then after we sat down and talked all night when we rented movies earlier that day to watch, as a family but like my family nothing ever happens accordingly or on time. You know when your having fun and laughing you don't want it to end and you forget about everything let time go by and keep on doing what you do. But as time catch's up to you ad running on low energy because you been excited all day to see your @CAPS2 brother and to share story's tell jokes and laugh having a good time you get sleepy and in some real need of some rest like sleep in your bed in the covers and with the lights off, in silence. Oh good times having pleasant dreams of food and girls. Most of the time there put together in one hole dream after dream ha ha ha. Then we woke up had a great time shared some laughs in the morning cracking joke nonstop. Talking hanging out i got to take my @CAPS2 brother to some party's of mine which really scared my parents but it was funny at the same time cause before we left my mom was like okay we letting you g out don't get yourself into any shit @CAPS1 don't alright your dads going to b picking you up so don't be acting stupid look after your brother okay and right after i said yeah alright bet. i questioned it and was like what the hell? why do i have to look after my @CAPS2 brother he should be looking out for me. but i guess that's what made it funny. ever since then we had a good time and that's where this story ends with me saying goodbye at the airport to him. hoping that one day soon ill see him again soon.",15.0,15.0,,30.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The writing lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

21221,8," My Laughter Story @CAPS1 you know that laughing really adds time to your life? Well you do now. Laughter is a great thing to have, because without laughter our world would be dull and pointless. On a day to day basis you should laugh everyday. Laughing can really help you get through a tough time.Me, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and @PERSON4 were just hanging out up at @ORGANIZATION4's house one day and @PERSON4 was being really funny, all of us were laughing hysterically at what @PERSON4 was saying, then suddenly @PERSON2 calls us and wants to hangout and for us to come to @LOCATION1, but she said only @NUM1 of us can go. So we all debated on who was going to go. We came to a decision and @PERSON4 was the one having to stay back, but @PERSON1 gave him something to keep him occupied. So @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and I were mobbing the bus to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. There was a tweaker on the bus and he was making us laugh so hard, but he wasn't even trying. So we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1. We were all hungry so we decided to get some @ORGANIZATION2. When we got to @ORGANIZATION2 we all just got a dollar burger which were rip offs so we all saved our pickles that were on the burger so when we left we could stick them on the windows. We @CAPS1 and it made us laugh so hard we could barley run away. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION3's apartment we knocked on her door, no one answered, so we knocked again, no answer again. We were just about to call her when she walks out of a different apartment and we all just started laughing because we pounded on someone elses door. When we walked in there was a party going on so we were like nice. When we got there we all had a couple of beers. We were having such a good time we were all just laughing and have the greatest time. That next morning we woke up at @NUM2 a.m because we had to ride the bus back to @LOCATION2 early because it was @DATE1 and the buses run only for a little bit. When we got on the bus the bus driver was making weird faces like he was constipated or something but he made me laugh really hard.When we arrived back in @LOCATION2 we called up @PERSON4 to see what he was doing, he was just hanging out in town so we just went and kicked it with him for the rest of the day and later we all went home. It was a good weekend.",15.0,16.0,,31.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

21223,8," Have you ever laughed so hard that you started crying? Were you alone? Most of the time when you are laughing about something you are with someone else. I believe that laughter brings two people closer because it's something you guys both share, a moment you and that other person can think of and picture over and over again in the future. Even if that person is miles away. I can remember it as if it just happened a couple weeks ago. I had just finished a conversation with @CAPS3 mom. I went into @CAPS3 room and unplugged @CAPS3 little black phone from the charger. I opened it and a blinking light flickered saying ""@NUM1 missed calls from @PERSON1."" I called her back to apologize for missing her phone call. I heard someone pick up, but nobody talked on the other end. "" @CAPS1, @PERSON1 you there?"" I had asked hoping I would get a reply out of her. I sure got a reply just not the one I was wanting. She started bawling. Trying to catch her breathe, the words barely escaping her mouth. ""@CAPS2, @CAPS3 grandpa just died.""  @CAPS3 heart sank into @CAPS3 stomach. @CAPS3 eyes started to water up and @CAPS3 throat started to close, making it harder to breathe. @CAPS3 voice was all shaky and rough. I said, ""I'm sorry @PERSON1."" and I started crying. Us both crying wasn't make anything better anytime soon. She then had explained that he had a heart attack and asked me how something could happen to someone that didn't deserve it. I didn't have an answer to give her though. I had never been in the position she was in. Who was I to know what to say, or do to help her? So I thought hard of what to say to her that would clear her mind a little bit. @CAPS3 brain started hurting when I finally found something from the heart to tell her, something I would want to hear if @CAPS3 grandpa passed away.  I said in a low calming voice, ""there isn't much I can tell you because I don't know from experience, but you're family needs you right now as much as you need them. Think about the good times you had with you're grandpa @CAPS4. The laughs you guys enjoyed together. I heard a slight giggle underneath her sniffling. She started telling me a story about how every year her family would take a weekend beach trip. How it was a time for her family to bond and how she would miss it. When she told me that story @CAPS3 heart warmed and the corners of @CAPS3 mouth went up a little. I was proud of myself for sticking in there and being strong for @CAPS3 friend.

21224,8," Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are many things that can cause people to laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it's mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are, and in what kind of situation you're in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like the time when I was in @LOCATION2 baking a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2.....  It was a nice warm evening in @LOCATION2, and I was making a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my @CAPS1 points out there's no more sugar. She tells me to go to the covers and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the covers I asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no lables on them. ""I think its the the jar on the left"", she said. I grab the jar on the left side without another word.  Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another, my @CAPS1 and I go and get the pie to serve to the family. They all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it. After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it. Imidiately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in there mouths'. Suddenly my @LOCATION1 makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty..... not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting. Then my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the covers. She sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it. Luckily enough, it was the salt jar. Then out of no where everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that evening, nobody could stop laughing. Clearly, the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget, and it'll probably never happen again. And after all that happend with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter is real. First, I was with my @CAPS1. Secondly, I was in my @LOCATION1's house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there. And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakeably hilarious. And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed. If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe easier and it's a lot of fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop imidiately and take the time to have a laugh.  ",20.0,23.0,,43.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":**

21225,8," Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. @CAPS4 @MONTH1 insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives.

You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.""  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moments."" @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared.",25.0,25.0,,50.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

21227,8," For me there are so many parts in my life that involve laughter. Having fun and laughing are the main things that I do in my life. When I laugh I feel happy, so whenever I'm sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then I'm happy again. I love making people laugh. Sometimes when I try and make people laugh I tell a joke but I'm not that funny. When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying.  I have amazing friends, I mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days I still love them and thank @CAPS1 for them everyday. My friends and I are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @CAPS2 always turns out to be funny. Even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @CAPS2's actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. @CAPS2's possible that people don't think @CAPS2's funny because they weren't there.   This year my family has an exchange student named, @PERSON1. She is from @LOCATION2. She is very shy and quiet. @PERSON1 never seemed like the type to make me laugh, @CAPS5 boy was I wrong. She is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @LOCATION4. I sure think she's funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that @CAPS2 is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @PERSON2. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply, ""I am not a midget! I am @NUM1' @NUM2'', you have to be @NUM1' @NUM4'' to be a midget!"" @CAPS2 is so cute when she does this.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION1. While I was living there I had been informed (over the phone I might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom. ""@CAPS2's a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION2,"" my family told me. I flew back up to @LOCATION3 for @CAPS4 with my family. When I got here I met @PERSON1. She seemed so quiet and sweet. @CAPS2 was late when we got home so I immediately went to sleep. The next day I woke up, called my grandma, then called @PERSON2 and asked her to come over and hang out with me. She came and met @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told us she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift and I replied, ""@CAPS5, that's tomorrow, lets go into town."" All three of us went to town and went to @ORGANIZATION1 For @CAPS6. When we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like. Somehow, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @PERSON2 picked out a tiny sized pair of underwear and shouted, ""@CAPS7 @PERSON1, what about these?"" @PERSON1 looked at her with the funniest facial expression and shouted back,""@CAPS8, I don't think my thighs would fit through that!"" @PERSON2 and I literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red. Based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet, ""keep to herself"" kind of girl so we just thought @CAPS2 was hilarious. We tease @PERSON1 about this quite often and she teases back about other funny things we've encountered. I've grown to love @PERSON1 and I love being with her and making fun out of all situations.

21229,8," As warm @DATE1 days turned into chilly winter nights, the girls (@PERSON3, @PERSON5, @PERSON2, @CAPS1 and @PERSON4) and I were wondering what we should do to add a little pizazz to our life's. No one knew what was to come or the laughter we would experience. It was one of the biggest games in the @ORGANIZATION1 season. It was to determine whether or not they would go to the playoffs to compete for the @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is the biggest @ORGANIZATION1 fan known to man. She was of coarse, all decked out in @CAPS3 attire. We watched the game, had a few shots of apple juice and pigged out on @ORGANIZATION2.   Halftime was coming right around the corner and to say the least, the halftime show wasn't going to be all that and a bag of chips. I pulled my camera from my @PERSON1 look alike bag and pressed record. While I was walking around in a circle trying to get everyone in the video, @PERSON3 was having a little too much fun on a red exercise ball. She was bouncing up and down at least @NUM1 or three inches into the @CAPS7. A light bulb went off in my head. I handed the camera to @PERSON4 and slowly moved over to where @PERSON3 was bouncing. Just as @PERSON3 screamed, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7!"" I kicked the exercise ball out from under her and when she came back down she was straight on her back!  @PERSON3 was too busy laughing and trying to breath to tell @CAPS5 how stupid I was. I was on the floor curled into a ball trying really hard not to pee my pants when all of sudden I hear this bang sound. I look up and the camera was lying on the floor next to @PERSON4, @PERSON5, and @PERSON2 who were laughing along with @CAPS5. @PERSON3 finally got the strength to get up. She came over and smacked @CAPS5 across the head and said, ""@CAPS8't ever do that again."" I'd say we had a better halftime show then the @ORGANIZATION1 did.  As the game ended, the weather changed and it began to snow. While everyone scurried to find their shoes, knocking into one another, I grabbed the camera not worrying if I got sick or not. We spent the last hour doing two of my favorite things; taking pictures and making memories. We went back inside and slowly went into slumber after drinking a little too much hot chocolate and apple juice. @PERSON3 has always been an early bird. I felt this sharp pain in my back and I shot straight up. Only to quickly realize that it was only her fist. Soon after everyone else arose from their warm blankets. Everyone @CAPS9 @CAPS1. We let her sleep and wondered outside again. It snowed. A @CAPS11. We thought of a plan and began to gather all the snow into one giant pile. @CAPS1 is a heavy sleeper so we picked her up, open the door that led to the backyard and plopped her right down in the center of the pile.  @CAPS1's eyes opened big and wide. Her mouth followed doing the same thing. She used every bad word she could possibly think of, including some in @CAPS12 that even she didn't know the meaning of. Soon, we were all in the snow laughing so hard we couldn't even @CAPS6 our breaths to apologize. @CAPS1 came to realize that it was an exceptionally good joke and began laughing along with the rest of us. In the end, we all had a good laugh and a cold to share that night. Laughter is the most important element in any relationship. It makes the bond between you and others stronger. Whoever said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" was @PERCENT1 right.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

There are a lot of times where laughter was the biggest part of our friendship. But @CAPS3 not sure if we just think were funny or if people think were funny. My two best @CAPS2 are @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2. I've actually know both of them since we were little. It was about second grade when we became @CAPS2. Although we were never really close until about sixth grade. Now days @CAPS3 closer @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, then I am to @LOCATION1. I remember when @LOCATION2 and I would throw little pieces of eraser at each other across the room nearly missing our teacher. The first memory I remember @CAPS1 @PERSON2 was maybe when we were in third grade. We would goof off and mess around in @LOCATION3. The three of us haven't hangout a lot since high school started. It also doesn't help when we each go to different schools. But when @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and I do hangout were always laughing and having a good time. One example of laughter bringing us together, is when we went to @PERSON1 skate park for my birthday a few years back. @PERSON2's grandma was taking us there and along the way we asked if we could stop and get @ORGANIZATION1. I just got an @CAPS4 camera for my birthday so I decided to bring that along. We went the the @ORGANIZATION1's located on @NUM1 street. As we were going through the drive-thru and @PERSON2's grandma was ordering. @PERSON2 decided to roll his window down and started ordering stuff for himself at the same time his grandma was. He asked for a @ORGANIZATION2 and a large fry. What made this really funny was that his grandma was getting mad. She told @PERSON2 to stop and told the person over the mic not to listen to the male voice in the background. But @PERSON2 kept doing it anyways. When we were pulling up to the window to get the food @PERSON2 told his grandma to pull up far enough so he could get the food. So as we were pulling up @PERSON2 rolled his window up down and got the food. @CAPS3 so glad I brought my camera and recorded the whole thing. When we got there we hopped out of the car and went to the park. It was later in the day when we got there, probably about three or four. At first none of us really skated cause we were looking around. But when we did start skating we stayed there for about four or five hours. Cause when we left it was dark outside. There are four stair sets there, the two stair, the three stretch, the three block and the five stair. That's the order they go in from size and how hard it is to @PERSON3 them. Cause we were there for so long we had a lot of videos recorded. Some where of us skating, some where really random and funny, then others I don't know what the heck was going on in them. Later that day when we were tired and bored of being there @PERSON2's grandma came and picked us up. They both came over to my house when we got back. We just watched @CAPS5 and played video games. Its always funny to watch one of us get frustrated because were not winning. Eventually we stopped and listened to music. Around @NUM2 p.m @PERSON2 went home and @LOCATION2 stayed the @TIME1. As we were in my living room he was messing around @CAPS1 the tri-pod I had got @CAPS1 my camera. As he has it in his hands, he's unscrewing it and it falls apart. We both laught at first but then I got mad cause I just got that. This day was really fun, it was full of laughing, dedication to skating, and our friendship. It was a day that I felt closer to @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2.  ",16.0,20.0,,36.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

21233,8,"                            Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4  @CAPS1 your little, your exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS6 to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS1 your parents step in. They feed, and love and take care of you, but @CAPS4 importantly, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just effects the people around you, @CAPS2 also effects you. You can ask anyone if once in they're life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference my making them laugh. @CAPS4 will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH1 not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS1 I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS4 kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was backed to normal. People say, ""@CAPS6 come I never noticed @CAPS6 easy I had @CAPS2 @CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @CAPS2 bad then?"" @CAPS7 @CAPS2 doesn't matter @CAPS6 the problems change its all the same. @CAPS2 still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but your not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS6 if felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON1 being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS6 I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS1 she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS2 @CAPS1 people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS2 embarrassed me, for @CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS2 was different, and in a weird way @CAPS2 helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS2 wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON1 were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid your vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. Its all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference. Laughing is important. @CAPS2 changes people, no matter what the age.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

21236,8,"  Every @DATE1 my family, friends, and I pack up for an exciting trip to @ORGANIZATION1. we always take our @CAPS3 runner, and boat along with us. We rent a large cabin that is right on the water side. We stay for about one week and it is always around one hundred degree's, so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the water. It is located over the pass about an hour from @CAPS1. Their are many fun activities to do at @ORGANIZATION1 like @CAPS2, kayaking, aqua cycling, bike riding, boating, and lots more.   This was the first year that my brother had his boating permit and I was very excited because it is way more exciting to have him take us out tubing rather then my parents who go very slow, and they don't make it that much fun. He would always put one of us on the @CAPS3 runner to @CAPS3 the flag when one of us fell off, and one of us would be on the tube. One time he took me and my friend @PERSON1 out. It was in the latter afternoon, and that's when the water gets rough, and choppy. First @PERSON1 was on the tube and I was flagging on the back of the @CAPS3 runner with my brother. He would have us going around in circles at about @NUM1 mph. She ended up flying off right away.   Once @PERSON1 got up on the @CAPS3 runner I hopped on the the tube and i told my brother I was ready. We would do thumbs up to go faster, thumbs down to slow down, and @CAPS3 your arms around like your crazy to stop. He started going and I had my thumb up for a while waiting for him to get going. He started going really fast and I was flying every which way going in circles. Every time I would hit a @CAPS3 I would get whip flash. I put my thumb down to go slower and he didn't slow down he kept going faster, and faster. Then I waved my arms around to make him stop. @PERSON1 was the one watching me, and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that I wanted to keep going faster. Finally I did about two back flips into the water. I hit the water so fast that it felt like my skin was going to fall off, it hurt so bad.  It took about a minute for me to finally get to the top of the water when I took a huge gasp of air. I was sitting in the water waiting for my brother to drive over and pick me up. Something didn't feel right, I didn't have my bikini bottoms on any more. I started panicking and told my brother not to come over. I looked all around in the water for them but they were no were to be seen. I told my brother and he called my dad. My dad and mom were on there way to bring me a pair of shorts because their was no way I was getting out of the water with no shorts on.   I had a blast at @ORGANIZATION1 and I have a great story that I will be telling for the rest of my life. I cant wait to go back next year and i know that I will be bringing an super tight shorts to go tubing in.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,": The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.

21237,8,"  When you laugh, what are you thinking about? Who are you with? What are you doing ? When you were three you laughed because someone went, ""@CAPS1-a-boo""and they contorted their face. When you were thirteen you laughed because someone looked different and wasn't wearing clothes that were ""in"". By the time your twenty-three you laugh with your friends because your friend is drunk and doing something stupid in the middle of the party. But when you find yourself at thirty-three your laughing while your husband is wrestling your five year old. Well about three years back my brother and I finally figured out how to have a relationship.   The @PERSON1 family has always been complicated. When we tell people how we are related, their response is always, ""@CAPS2...What? Start over!"", so we try to avoid the topic. My brother @PERSON2 has lived in @LOCATION2 his whole life with his mother and step @CAPS3, so neither our @CAPS3 or I really had a close relationship with him. Although it wasn't our dads fault, we only saw @PERSON2 maybe twice a year. In those two times a year, @PERSON2 and my sister @PERSON3, would always pick on me, hide from me and laugh at me because I couldn't do what they could. I used to hate it when he was coming down, because I knew I would spend most of that time crying and getting in trouble for things I didn't do. When three kids grow up together they find that they like each other better when they get along. My brother wasn't so mean to me anymore and he figured out that we were on the same side against the common enemy: @CAPS3. Our relationship has always grown around laughter, we get along because we are able to make jokes about one another everyday and know that it means nothing. Its our way of showing we care about each other, sometimes we laugh at other people and sometimes we laugh at ourselves. Now that my brother is off at college, we actually miss each other, and the key to our relationship is the laughter we share.  When my brother found that he actually liked me, he taught me everything about video games and helped me, we were not only on the same team in the video game, but also in real life. Summer @DATE1 my brother and I were sitting at home, bored because @CAPS3 was at work and @PERSON2 didn't have a car in @LOCATION1. We decided to play all the video games at least once throughout that endless day. That challenge didn't last long because the first and last game we played that day was @CAPS4 @NUM1. We started off just figuring out how it worked and where to go and we fought about it for a good hour. Then we started playing just to see who's team won, we started making jokes about each others players and we gave all the bad players, mean, really weird names, we laughed through the whole game. Then to make things more interesting we got into making our own characters and building a fantasy draft. @PERSON2, being a guy, came up with the grossest names and made the players look either really scary or really funny, he stacked their stats so they had an overall team average of @PERCENT1 in everything. I, being a girl, made all my guys really hot and muscular with funny names and only stacked their stats to what I thought was reasonable, depending on their good looks, so my team average was only @PERCENT2. From the moment of the tip, to the the moment we looked at the final stats for the game, we were laughing. Every time the announcer said one of our players names in that basketball context, it was so wrong but so funny, ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 for two"". When both teams made every shot and then by some chance somebody missed one, we made so many comments and jokes. By the time @CAPS3 had gotten home, he thought something was wrong because we were crying so hard from laughing, that our tan carpet had turned brown . Even through dinner, when we had calmed down, @PERSON2 would say something only I would know what it meant and we would just burst out laughing and @CAPS3 would look at us with a dumbfounded expression. Looking back I wouldn't trade anything for that day.  Now @PERSON2 and I sometimes bring up that day when we start playing a sports game or were just talking on the phone. We laugh and use context to make fun of each other. Ya you could say its not a very normal relationship, but that's how we know we love each other, because truth is, I don't even like video games, I only ever play a video game when he wants to. So since that day we have become closer, we don't fight, and we actually stand up for each other. So who ever said, "" Laughter is the shortest distance between to people."" is right.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21238,8," It seems like everyday of everyone's life they are being tested in every way shape and form and it seems like it will never end. It gets to be stressful and complicated but this is what makes us human. Something else that makes us human is laughter but no matter how bad things get to be it can always be changed by a knock knock joke, comic ad, or just one word from a best friend. Iv been with my dad and a couple of his high school buddies as they are telling stories about some of the crazy stuff they did when they were in high school. My dad and his friend @CAPS1 went off into a story about when they bought a @NUM1 @LOCATION1 tempest for @MONEY1. It turned out to be the greatest life lesson and some of the funniest stories in my life.  This was my dad's second car he ever had with a @NUM2 and a @NUM3 speed anything was possible. It started out when my dad first drove it to school which didn't last long, because an hour later. @CAPS1 and my dad left doing a burn out on speed bumps in the school parking lot. This car was a burn out animal backing up then side stepping the clutch to second and it would all be up in smoke. One day my dad was sliding around gravel corners and one of the rear bias ply tires blown out it thrown that car into the ditch and messed up the side pretty bad. Joe enders pulled him out and half a gallon of dera glass a hammer and a can of paint later it was ready to go again.  The next story I heard was when my dad's friend borrowed the car he needed something to get him back and forth to work. So my dad hands him the keys and says ""keep it on @NUM3 wheels"". Two weeks later on a weekend he was out messing around and the car slid off the road and rolled a few times and buckled the roof. I never heard how he got out but somehow he did and returned the car to my dad. After that it had an organ transplant of a roof from a @CAPS2 that hit a tree, @NUM5 weeks later and it's ready to go again. Now it's just something about a rear wheel drive car and snow that makes us kids again. sliding around in snow was the last thing this car ever did. My dad and @CAPS1 were driving in the snow having fun when the back end decided to trade places with the front. They lost control as they slid across the winter wonderland to a lonely telephone pole. The car slid into the pole and it was the end of fun. Finally the car had died and my dad had brought the car back home. He decided not to fix it and parted it out he sold the @NUM3 speed for @NUM7 @MONEY1 the engine for @NUM8 and the rear end for @NUM9 the trunk and hood weren't far behind for another @NUM9 the seat, steering column and radio my dad kept, the rest was scrap. So all in all my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life for no more than gas money and a few spare parts. God bless @LOCATION2 and I hope someday soon I can have memories like that.

21241,8,"  Laughter is important  The last two weeks of school, and I was told the best news ever. My mom had told me that I would be flying to @LOCATION1, by myself. I was excited because I haven't seen my family in awhile. Even though @CAPS1 been on a plane a couple of times, I was still scared, I have never flew by myself, so this was going to be something extremely new. Even though I was excited and scared at the same time, I just kept thinking about seeing everyone in my family, and even meeting family members that I have never seen or heard from before. School seemed to be going by very slow, and I was very anxious. When two weeks passed I already had my bags packed and was ready to go. My mom was trying not to cry, but she did anyways. I walked threw the metal detectors then down a long hall way, finally I had got on the plane. On the plane ride I was thinking about meeting my real dad, and that's all I was thinking about the whole time I was on the plane. I landed in @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 pm that day. I was glad too because I was tired. My sister picked me up from the airport. Me and my sister didn't have a close relationship, so it was kind of awkward. She started talking about times when we were younger, and how we had fun. Since I was in @LOCATION1 I wanted to see a lot of my family members, most of my family members already knew that I was in town, news travels fast. When my aunt's seen me they were in shock, they said that I had grew so much. I was so happy because it was one of the best moments ever. I met so many people, especially family friends, it was a amazing because I even met some of my moms school friends. Days after, I had got a text message from one of my sisters that I have never seen or met before, and she was so happy to know that I was in town. She told me that she and my dad wanted to see me, and spend some time together, so we made plans. I was really nervous, because the only time that I have seen my dad was when I was really young. That was fifteen years ago. I really didn't know what I was going to do or say when I was finally going to meet them, I was very scared, so I decided to take my sister and my cousin just so it wouldn't be awkward. We decided to meet at my grandmas house. I haven't seen her in awhile, and unfortunately she wasn't there. When my dad got there, I didn't know what to do, I didn't recognize him, or even my other sister. We gave each other hugs. When we got into the house we were all quiet, and all my dad could say was ""@CAPS2"" because I grew so much. He then started talking about the silly little things I did when I was a little girl, and it made us all laugh. All we did was laugh, and it made me cry a little. If it wasn't for laughing my relationship with my dad couldn't have been better. ",15.0,15.0,,30.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,4,4,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21245,8," What exactly is laughter? Is it when something virtuous happens and it makes a person joyful? According to @PERSON1's @CAPS1, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is, when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty-headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming instinct. It had been almost two years exactly, since her and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would brings us together, until one day when I was at the store and we ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing. Right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless, and not worth talking about. To be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and I would have never been reunited. When you meet new people what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you? You usually tell jokes, or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it. Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job, or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality. Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out, and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. @CAPS3 didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment she just was a mess. Until one day she told me that she revived a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. @CAPS3 rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her, ""I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's to short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst."" @CAPS2 and there @CAPS3 realized that what her grandma had said was true. You can't live through life in a drag, just have to get up and take it. @CAPS3 was very devastated about her grandmas lost, but @CAPS2 again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crisis. She will always love her grandma.  When you learn how to take life as it comes people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways or some just don't learn at all. For example, @CAPS3 learned from experience going on with school and struggling with tying to find a job. Her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well. Other people learn form meeting new people, and just having fun with life, or like me I learned the hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over a empty- headed argument. Laughter comes in different shapes and sizes, we as human beings have to approach it, whether it's an argument or learning it as it comes. One way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it, its not a scary thing. The benefits of laughter is it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, its a good stress reliever as well. Laughter is a cause of merriment, a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself.",20.0,20.0,,40.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,4,16,,": The essay is clear and focused.

21246,8," Laughing at @CAPS1 bell. @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny, hilarious memories together. We are always laughing about something even if @CAPS7's something completely stupid or actually really funny. We laugh at things like people that look funny, or people that say stupid things. Also we laugh at funny things we do. @CAPS8 one thing that has always stuck to @CAPS11 head, the time at @CAPS1 bell. One day after school, me and @CAPS11 best friend @PERSON1 decided to go across the street from our school and eat lunch at @CAPS1 bell. We ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for @CAPS7. A few minuets later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @CAPS7. ""@CAPS4"" I said to @LOCATION1 as i took a bite of @CAPS11 @CAPS5 five layer burrito. ""@CAPS6""@CAPS7 was really hot and burned @CAPS11 mouth. I had to wait for a few minuets to eat @CAPS11 burrito. So we both just sat, waiting for our burritos to cool off, an talked about school and other things that was going on with our lives. A couple minuets later a man walked in, he was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old, and he had his back against us so we couldn't see his face. The man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat. Meanwhile I thought @CAPS11 burrito was cooled down enough and i went to take a bite, at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head. Next thing i knew @CAPS11 burrito was coming out of @CAPS11 mouth and I was dieing of laughter.  @CAPS11 burrito was spit completely out of @CAPS11 mouth, and all over me an @LOCATION1. All over @CAPS11 hair, mouth, clothes, and all over the table. I was so embarrassed that i couldn't help @CAPS8 to laugh. I think the main reason i was laughing so hard was because the man was just so scary looking, @CAPS8 wow we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight. You might think this was the end of @CAPS11 bad day, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 only gets worse. Eating @CAPS11 burrito seemed forever, because we were laughing forever. @CAPS7 probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito. Meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink. So I went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS10. As i was returning to @CAPS11 table i wasn't looking and ran into a man that was in line. I almost spilled @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS8 luckily I didn't. Returning to @CAPS11 seat i was talking to @PERSON1 about how bad @CAPS11 day was, and how @CAPS7 couldn't get any worse. Then i took a drink an I started to choke on @CAPS11 @CAPS10, @CAPS7 was so bad that i spit everything out onto @LOCATION1, @CAPS10 went flying everywhere, @CAPS7 even came out of @CAPS11 noes. So i went into the bathroom, and cleaned @CAPS11 self up, caught @CAPS11 breath, and told @PERSON1 i was ready to go home. When i look back and think about the day at @CAPS1 bell with @CAPS11 best friend, I not only think about how embarrassing @CAPS7 was for me and her, @CAPS8 also that @CAPS7 was a really great, hilarious memory that i will probably remember for the rest of @CAPS11 life. As i said before @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny memories together, and still we are making more everyday.",17.0,20.0,,37.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,3,,,":** The essay lacks a clear central idea or purpose.
