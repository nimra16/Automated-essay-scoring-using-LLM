      "Everyone has an imaginary place where he or she wants to hide themselves from real world troubles and worries. Some go to sleep to dream pleasant and release their minds from the stress, others go to mediate exercise and release the tensions and emotions. I do both of them some time to release my stress and when I am feeling   upset and being emotional.\n",
      "From my childhood I liked to see nature so my favourite place is wildlife which is located far away from people and cities. I like the high mountains having snow peaks, peak corn, meadow and wood. There is pure air which is filled from the rich smell of flowers and wood. There is no one else except me and the wild animal plus birds flying in the dark blue sky. The weather there is cool and there is no need for a jacket and hat. This place is a perfect example of peace and claim. This whole place is covered with large and huge trees, on which there are juicy fruits.\n",
      "I love to climb mountains. One day I start my journey to reach the cliff of a mountain where I can see the whole plane on my feet. On the cliff there was a very cool wind which was not cold because the sun was always ahead of me in the dark blue sky. I love this place because I can see the come and go of clouds. They never bother me. They are small and puffy like cream.\n",
      "The other place that I like to visit is the water bank, green land and large dark brown branching tree on which I can sit and can see water flowing. I love to walk barefoot on green grass and lie on the grass and steal the sky from my eyes. This is a beautiful place, the birds are singing above and there is no other sound. I have grown a tree there. Whenever the mild wind came it shuffled into one position and the sound was very relaxing. In this place I am not alone. I have a horse and sometimes I see this whole place on my horse and I ride it very fast. This place is for long mediation\n",
      "I like to be relaxed and in my comfort zone but sometimes I try to come out of my comfort zone and try different things. That's why I like to climb mountains. These both places are dangerous and speculative. We should have to see the harmony of nature; it is very relaxing therefore we can visit these when we are having stress. These places freshen your mind and from visiting it you think that you get a new life.\n",

      "Bewailing sounds ghosted through the trees. Whether it was from victim or victor, only the forest could tell. It was truly a place to make your veins freeze over.

The intensely nasty wafting stench of meat made me nousiatic. \n",

      "Indeed the vastness of the Amazon forest is nerve-wracking. Till the ending spot my sight could reach, there were gigantic sequoias glaring at me as if I owned their debt. I was encircled by antiquated hickory-brown woods and creepy looking spider orchids so as to cut my escape. Clumps of bushes and overhanging limbs aroused a thrilling vibe in my core and the whole environment seemed celestial and fictional Teribethia perhaps because I have never been in such wild nature. \n",
      "The hiss of lime-green snakes griping tree trucks compactly captivated my attention thus I began to ponder on the ecology of this planet.Through the lattice of leaves I saw a glance of gloomy blood moon which petrified me even harder as if it added insult to an injury.A few steps ahead I heard piercing shrieks of rowdy owls, I instantly looked beside me and what I saw felt vom-worthy; it was a group of jet-black cats chomping on an enormous piece of flash. The intensely nasty wafting stench of meat made me nousiatic. \n",
      "However, the dusky sky above me was magnificent, it was as clear as crystal since unlike the populated localities there was no pollution, no emissions given off hence the sight could go across the galaxies. Yet the entire experiance to some extent made me terror-stricken but surely was wholesome. \n",

      "Verily, the central park of New york city is a breath-taking place. It rejuvenates an exhausted person by its fresh and ravishing vicinity hence is a quintessence of charm. Durings last spring I utterly relished this park. It was enchanting seeing yolk-yellow ducklings dancing blissfully in a small murky pond. The vivid environment of the park was nostalgic. \n",
      "I could see numerous splendid flowers peeping at me thus I inhaled deeply and a remarkable fragrance struck my lungs. The park is known as the garden of scent, certainly it could never have a more suitable title than this. \n",
      "Underneath a huge shadowy willow I squinted at Young bunnies jumping in contentment like frogs with fur, this view filled me up with joy. Through the ever-green trees the luminous sunbeam made me take off a few layers I had worn since it's never too warm in NewYork.  \n",
      "Nevertheless, visiting this park every weekend can definitely make you happier than ever. \n",
