However, the students are likely to face some problems during their initial days in school. The sudden change in the environment is what makes the candidates uncomfortable. They do not feel a part of the institute. Moreover, approaching teachers and students is even more difficult.\\n\\nRecommendations/Suggestions\\nTo help the new students, we can conduct an assembly on the first day of school to introduce the teachers and the students to each other. Furthermore, a warm-hearted welcome will give them a friendly atmosphere which is likely to make them comfortable.\\n\\nBenefits \\nSimultaneously, all of this will bring some benefits to the students and the school. This will allow the candidates to adjust to a new surrounding in less time span. The students will feel like a part of the institute and therefore, the will be able to concentrate on their studies. Thus, producing good grades. Due to all this, the reputation of the school is likely to enhance and the biggest achievement of a school is the satisfaction of its students.\\n\\nConclusion\\nOverall, I hope that my recommendations will be taken into suggestion and they will make starting at school easier. If you have any questions related to my suggestions, you can find me in class X-C-Green at anytime between 9:00 am to 2:00 pm.\\n'"

      "Subject: Convincing students to take part in sports                           This report is going to introduce why the majority of students in our school are not interested in sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few reasons why students are not interested in sports. Students spend most of their time in studies and spend their most of the time in sitting. Students also spend their time in excessive use of internet. Students also spend most of their time in watching televison of playing games on their mobiles or desktops. Due to all these activities they skip their co-curricular or physical activities.Most of the parents emphasize on their child’s academic performance rather than their co-curriculum activities. Parents think that academics is more important than co-curricular activities. Parents also think that sports or games are the waste of time and don’t let their child go out and play.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sports equipment that is provided in our school is not enough for the students.Besides,the poor conditions of fields and courts cause students to dislike the sports because the field will become muddy when it's raining.\n",
      "These are a few suggestions which can be adopted to overcome the above issues. First and foremost, the school authorities should emphasize the importance of sports in school. The students must know that sports keep their bodies as fit as a fiddle. Besides, dialogue sessions should be conducted with parents to inform them of the vital role of sport in helping to create a well-rounded student. As we know, sport is essential for health. As the saying goes, “Prevention is better than cure”. Therefore, we should always exercise to prevent diseases. Moreover, the sports facilities in school must be improved too. Nowadays, our school lacks sports equipment for students to use during physical education. This causes them to lose interest in sports but put all their effort in their academic performances. School authorities should employ qualified trainers to improve the students’ skills in sports. A good trainer may further increase the students’ curiosity in sports. Students can learn many essential values through sports. Furthermore, more competitions in sports should be organized in our school too. For example, football and basketball matches can be held in schools for those who are interested in the games. Plus, those who excel in competitions should be rewarded with attractive prizes to encourage them. I hope the authorities can consider the suggestions that I had stated. I believe that the above ways can help the school attain their goal of creating interest and encouraging student participation in sports.\n",

      "This report would be elaborating the reasons for the lack of interest of students in sports. Furthermore, we shall look over numerous possible ways to expand student’s interest in such activities involving physical excretion and developing skills. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sports are essential to be played by every student, as they consist of teamwork, leadership, social skills, brainpower and passion which could lead students to success and a better future. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since most of the students in our school aren’t interested in sports thereupon, we have surveyed the reasons for their lack of interest in sports. Most of the students proclaimed that because of the unbearable high temperature they have become unable to play sports in outdoor sports fields and many of them don’t get adequate hydration as water dispensers are quite far from the ground.  Moreover, several students also said that they don’t get enough sports periods, thus their interest has been fading by and by. Although many of them expressed delight in taking part in some sort of contests, our management doesn’t organize such activities more often. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our school has been in the top ranking for 23 years. Various government and private funds have been given to our school to make it even better and facilitate students as much as we can. Hence, we should cooperate with students to overcome the problems faced by them. As far as our school is located in a warm area where we have high degrees frequently, therefore we should facilitate students with indoor, immense and air-conditioned stadiums for the sake of their ease. We should also increase the number of water dispensers by at least two dispensers/water coolers per room as it has been quite hot nowadays whereas we should provide required hydration to students. Meanwhile, there must be two sports periods per week since physical activities are significant to keep yourself fit. Last but not the least organizing distinct galas and contests would create passion in students thereupon, they’d be determined to achieve certain goals and that’s how they would get a chance to cope up with their aspiration and they shall try hard to bring out their effort, skill and courage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I hope that you will pay heed to my suggestions and shall try to act upon them.  However, they would certainly be able to maintain student’s fondness for sports. If you have any queries regarding my suggestions, you can find me in o-level-1.\n",

After this survey, we got to know that the majority of students think that playing sports is a waste of time and they believe it's better to give priority to their studies. Moreover, few students said that their parents do not support them in such activities because they think that these are children’s golden years so they should focus on their studies only. These were the major reasons that were discovered.\n",

Furthermore, students stated that they need a trainer to guide them in sports. These students are willing to participate in sport activities but unfortunately they are incapable because of poor facilities.\n",

      "Subject: Starting off the school as easy as possible for new students\n",
      " \n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The following report is about the lack of interest among the students of IBA PSS and suggestions to overcome it.\n",
      " \n",
      "Reasons for having lack of interest\n",
      "I have recentlsurveyedng the students of IBA PSS. The results of the survey show that among 1,000 students from Class one to eight, only 200 would choose sports as their preferred leisure activity during their spare time. Students assume playing sports involves getting hot, dirty and sweaty as well as being occasionally sunburned. Also, the students complained about their lack of time. Many of them commented that this was caused by the longer school hours and also because of many co-curricular societies, such as uniformed bodies. According to them, their parents place an excessive amount of attention on academic work. Many of them have stated that it has become an obsession with their parents to make them excellent in academics.\n",
      " \n",
      "Current situation of School facilities\n",
      "Students have complained that the school field and sports equipment are not at a reasonable level. Since the school field is fully utilized, the students expect it to be at its level best. However, they have said that the opposite is often true. There is insufficient sports equipment in the school storage room with only two soccer balls. The school's hockey equipment is also in very bad condition with several broken hockey sticks that have not been replaced. The poor conditions of the school field and the badminton courts have also drawn the anger of the students. Many students submitted complaints that the school field is very wet and muddy after it rains while the badminton courts' floor is heavily damaged.\n",
      " \n",
      "Suggestions to overcome it\n",
      "Due to the overwhelming to lack of interest in sports among the students, I have formulated a few suggestions for consideration. Among my suggestions is that the school authorities, such as the Head of Students Affairs, should stress the importance of sports to the students. The message would have a much greater impact on the students if delivered by a person in authority. Moreover, the school authorities could hold a dialogue wParent-Teachers during the next Parent Teacher Meeting. During the dialogue the school authorities could explain to the parents about the importance of sports in the life of students in IBA PSS. On top of that, the school could improve the sporting facilities for the students and employ qualified trainers. However, the school authorities could organize more competitions related to sports and offer attractive prizes to the winners. This would go a long way towards attracting the interest of the students to get involved in sports.\n",
      " \n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Sports are an essential and important aspect for every human being and due to many reasons students of IBA PSS have lack of interest in sports and this needs to be solved and should be overcome as soon as possible so that the Student council remains healthy\n",

      "\n",
      "To: The principal, of IBA Public School Sukkur\n",
      "From: Student of Cambridge Section (O-Level 1) \n",
      "Date: June/4th/ 2021 \n",
      "\n",
      "Subject: Students interest in sports\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      " \n",
      "Many of my schoolmates are not interested in sports. I had carried out a survey on the reasons for their lack of interest. The reasons that causes students not to be interested in sports comes from themselves, parents and facilities. Firstly, the attitude of students for sports was wasting their time. They feel that time is money, so they use their time to study. They think that studying is more important than sports and study ensures their future. This causes them to have a lack of time for sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parent’s point of view\n",
      "\n",
      "Parents are also the reason why students lack interest in sports. Parents emphasize their child’s academic performance only. So, they sign up for tuition classes such as English tuition class, Chemistry tuition class and so on for their children to improve their children’s academic performance. The last reason that I learned from a survey is facilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cause\n",
      "\n",
      "Some students are interested in sports, but there is insufficient sports equipment for them. The sport equipment like basketball, football, and so on are not enough for those students. Besides, the poor condition of the field and courts in schools cause students to dislike sports because the field will become muddy when it is raining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "These are a few suggestions which can be adopted to overcome the above issues. First and foremost, the school authorities should emphasize the importance of sports in school. The students must know that sports keep their bodies as fit as a fiddle. Besides, dialogue sessions should be conducted with parents to inform them the vital role of sport in helping to create a well-rounded student. As we know, sport is essential for health. As the saying goes, “Prevention is better than cure”. Therefore, we should always exercise to prevent us from diseases. Moreover, the sports facilities in school must be improved too. Nowadays, our school lacks sports equipment for students to use during physical education. This causes them to lose interest in sports but put all their effort into their academic performances. School authorities should employ qualified trainers to improve the students’ skills in sports. A good trainer may further increase the students’ curiosity in sports. Students can learn many essential values through sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, more competitions in sports should be organized in our school too. For example, badminton and basketball matches can be held in schools for those who are interested in the games. Plus, those who excel in competitions should be rewarded with attractive prizes to encourage them. I hope the authorities can consider the suggestions that I had stated. I believe that the above ways can help the school attain their goal of creating interest and encouraging student participation in sports.\n",

      "The student has addressed all the required points in the report. However, the introduction could have been more specific and clear. The student should have mentioned the purpose of the report and the audience to whom the report is addressed.\n",

      "Language: 11/15\n",
      "\n",
      "The student has used a good range of vocabulary, but there are some errors in grammar and sentence structure. The student should have used more complex sentence structures to convey their ideas more effectively. There are also some spelling and punctuation errors that need to be corrected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mistakes/Errors:\n",
      "- The student should have used \"cause\" instead of \"reason\" in the paragraph discussing the lack of sports equipment.\n",
      "- The sentence \"The students must know that sports keep their bodies as fit as a fiddle\" could have been rephrased to sound more professional.\n",
      "- The sentence \"As we know, sport is essential for health\" could have been rephrased to sound more academic.\n",
      "- The sentence \"School authorities should employ qualified trainers to improve the students’ skills in sports\" could have been rephrased to sound more formal. \n",
      "- The sentence \"Students can learn many essential values through sports\" could have been rephrased to sound more specific. \n",
