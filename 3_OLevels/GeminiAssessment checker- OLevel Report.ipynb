However, the students are likely to face some problems during their initial days in school. The sudden change in the environment is what makes the candidates uncomfortable. They do not feel a part of the institute. Moreover, approaching teachers and students is even more difficult.\\n\\nRecommendations/Suggestions\\nTo help the new students, we can conduct an assembly on the first day of school to introduce the teachers and the students to each other. Furthermore, a warm-hearted welcome will give them a friendly atmosphere which is likely to make them comfortable.\\n\\nBenefits \\nSimultaneously, all of this will bring some benefits to the students and the school. This will allow the candidates to adjust to a new surrounding in less time span. The students will feel like a part of the institute and therefore, the will be able to concentrate on their studies. Thus, producing good grades. Due to all this, the reputation of the school is likely to enhance and the biggest achievement of a school is the satisfaction of its students.\\n\\nConclusion\\nOverall, I hope that my recommendations will be taken into suggestion and they will make starting at school easier. If you have any questions related to my suggestions, you can find me in class X-C-Green at anytime between 9:00 am to 2:00 pm.\\n'"

      "Subject: Students interest in sports\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      " \n",
      "Many of my schoolmates are not interested in sports. I had carried out a survey on the reasons for their lack of interest. The reasons that causes students not to be interested in sports comes from themselves, parents and facilities. Firstly, the attitude of students for sports was wasting their time. They feel that time is money, so they use their time to study. They think that studying is more important than sports and study ensures their future. This causes them to have a lack of time for sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parent’s point of view\n",
      "\n",
      "Parents are also the reason why students lack interest in sports. Parents emphasize their child’s academic performance only. So, they sign up for tuition classes such as English tuition class, Chemistry tuition class and so on for their children to improve their children’s academic performance. The last reason that I learned from a survey is facilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cause\n",
      "\n",
      "Some students are interested in sports, but there is insufficient sports equipment for them. The sport equipment like basketball, football, and so on are not enough for those students. Besides, the poor condition of the field and courts in schools cause students to dislike sports because the field will become muddy when it is raining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggestions\n",

      "These are a few suggestions which can be adopted to overcome the above issues. First and foremost, the school authorities should emphasize the importance of sports in school. The students must know that sports keep their bodies as fit as a fiddle. Besides, dialogue sessions should be conducted with parents to inform them the vital role of sport in helping to create a well-rounded student. As we know, sport is essential for health. As the saying goes, “Prevention is better than cure”. Therefore, we should always exercise to prevent us from diseases. Moreover, the sports facilities in school must be improved too. Nowadays, our school lacks sports equipment for students to use during physical education. This causes them to lose interest in sports but put all their effort into their academic performances. School authorities should employ qualified trainers to improve the students’ skills in sports. A good trainer may further increase the students’ curiosity in sports. Students can learn many essential values through sports.\n",

Students also spend their time in excessive use of internet. Students also spend most of their time in watching televison of playing games on their mobiles or desktops. Due to all these activities they skip their co-curricular or physical activities.Most of the parents emphasize on their child’s academic performance rather than their co-curriculum activities. Parents think that academics is more important than co-curricular activities. Parents also think that sports or games are the waste of time and don’t let their child go out and play.\n",

      "\n",
      "This report would be elaborating the reasons for the lack of interest of students in sports. Furthermore, we shall look over numerous possible ways to expand student’s interest in such activities involving physical excretion and developing skills. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sports are essential to be played by every student, as they consist of teamwork, leadership, social skills, brainpower and passion which could lead students to success and a better future. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since most of the students in our school aren’t interested in sports thereupon, we have surveyed the reasons for their lack of interest in sports. Most of the students proclaimed that because of the unbearable high temperature they have become unable to play sports in outdoor sports fields and many of them don’t get adequate hydration as water dispensers are quite far from the ground.  Moreover, several students also said that they don’t get enough sports periods, thus their interest has been fading by and by. Although many of them expressed delight in taking part in some sort of contests, our management doesn’t organize such activities more often. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our school has been in the top ranking for 23 years. Various government and private funds have been given to our school to make it even better and facilitate students as much as we can. Hence, we should cooperate with students to overcome the problems faced by them. As far as our school is located in a warm area where we have high degrees frequently, therefore we should facilitate students with indoor, immense and air-conditioned stadiums for the sake of their ease. We should also increase the number of water dispensers by at least two dispensers/water coolers per room as it has been quite hot nowadays whereas we should provide required hydration to students. Meanwhile, there must be two sports periods per week since physical activities are significant to keep yourself fit. Last but not the least organizing distinct galas and contests would create passion in students thereupon, they’d be determined to achieve certain goals and that’s how they would get a chance to cope up with their aspiration and they shall try hard to bring out their effort, skill and courage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I hope that you will pay heed to my suggestions and shall try to act upon them.  However, they would certainly be able to maintain student’s fondness for sports. If you have any queries regarding my suggestions, you can find me in o-level-1.\n",

      "Date: 6th June 2021\n",
      " \n",
      "Subject: Starting off the school as easy as possible for new students\n",
      " \n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The following report is about the lack of interest among the students of IBA PSS and suggestions to overcome it.\n",
      " \n",
      "Reasons for having lack of interest\n",
      "I have recentlsurveyedng the students of IBA PSS. The results of the survey show that among 1,000 students from Class one to eight, only 200 would choose sports as their preferred leisure activity during their spare time. Students assume playing sports involves getting hot, dirty and sweaty as well as being occasionally sunburned. Also, the students complained about their lack of time. Many of them commented that this was caused by the longer school hours and also because of many co-curricular societies, such as uniformed bodies. According to them, their parents place an excessive amount of attention on academic work. Many of them have stated that it has become an obsession with their parents to make them excellent in academics.\n",
      " \n",
      "Current situation of School facilities\n",
      "Students have complained that the school field and sports equipment are not at a reasonable level. Since the school field is fully utilized, the students expect it to be at its level best. However, they have said that the opposite is often true. There is insufficient sports equipment in the school storage room with only two soccer balls. The school's hockey equipment is also in very bad condition with several broken hockey sticks that have not been replaced. The poor conditions of the school field and the badminton courts have also drawn the anger of the students. Many students submitted complaints that the school field is very wet and muddy after it rains while the badminton courts' floor is heavily damaged.\n",
      " \n",
      "Suggestions to overcome it\n",
      "Due to the overwhelming to lack of interest in sports among the students, I have formulated a few suggestions for consideration. Among my suggestions is that the school authorities, such as the Head of Students Affairs, should stress the importance of sports to the students. The message would have a much greater impact on the students if delivered by a person in authority. Moreover, the school authorities could hold a dialogue wParent-Teachers during the next Parent Teacher Meeting. During the dialogue the school authorities could explain to the parents about the importance of sports in the life of students in IBA PSS. On top of that, the school could improve the sporting facilities for the students and employ qualified trainers. However, the school authorities could organize more competitions related to sports and offer attractive prizes to the winners. This would go a long way towards attracting the interest of the students to get involved in sports.\n",
      " \n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Sports are an essential and important aspect for every human being and due to many reasons students of IBA PSS have lack of interest in sports and this needs to be solved and should be overcome as soon as possible so that the Student council remains healthy\n",

      "**Task Fulfilment: 12/15**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The essay addresses the task of writing a report on the lack of interest in sports among students at IBA PSS and provides suggestions to overcome it.\n",
      "* The essay includes all the required points: reasons for lack of interest, school facilities, and suggestions to overcome the problems.\n",
      "* The essay is well-organized and follows a logical structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Language: 11/15**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Accuracy:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The essay is generally accurate, with few grammatical or spelling errors.\n",
      "* However, there are some errors in verb tense and subject-verb agreement. For example:\n",
      "    * \"I have recentlsurveyedng the students of IBA PSS.\" should be \"I recently surveyed the students of IBA PSS.\"\n",
      "    * \"Students assume playing sports involves getting hot, dirty and sweaty as well as being occasionally sunburned.\" should be \"Students assume that playing sports involves getting hot, dirty, and sweaty, as well as being occasionally sunburned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Vocabulary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The essay uses a variety of vocabulary, but some of the words are not used correctly. For example:\n",
      "    * \"The school field and sports equipment are not at a reasonable level.\" should be \"The school field and sports equipment are not of a reasonable quality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sentence Structure:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The essay uses a variety of sentence structures, but some of the sentences are too long and complex. For example:\n",
      "    * \"According to them, their parents place an excessive amount of attention on academic work. Many of them have stated that it has become an obsession with their parents to make them excellent in academics.\" should be broken into two shorter sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Punctuation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The essay is generally well-punctuated, but there are some errors in comma usage. For example:\n",
      "    * \"Also, the students complained about their lack of time.\" should be \"Also, the students complained about their lack of time, which they attributed to several factors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The essay is well-written and addresses the task requirements. However, there are some errors in grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure that could be improved. With some additional editing and proofreading, the essay could be improved to a higher score. \n",

      "            It is very gloomy to see that numerous students are not involved in sports activities though it's significant for our physical and mental health both. After this survey, we got to know that the majority of students think that playing sports is a waste of time and they believe it's better to give priority to their studies. Moreover, few students said that their parents do not support them in such activities because they think that these are children’s golden years so they should focus on their studies only. These were the major reasons that were discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "School Facilities: \n",
      "            There were some students too who were passionate about sports but they said that they are unable to play because the school is lacking to provide them with better facilities. Furthermore, students stated that they need a trainer to guide them in sports. These students are willing to participate in sport activities but unfortunately they are incapable because of poor facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations: \n",
      "        In my opinion, the school should start campaigns to educate the students and the parents about the significance of sports. Also they should provide better facilities so that students who are desirous to play should continue their sports. \n",

      "\n",
      "Conclusion: \n",
      "The conclusion of this report is that the majority of students are not interested because they think it's a waste of time and other students who want to play sports but are incapable because of insufficient facilities. I hope that my suggestions will be taken seriously in order to solve this problem.\n",
