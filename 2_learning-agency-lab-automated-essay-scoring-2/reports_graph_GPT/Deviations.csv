00d576b,"Well in my favor I would have the Electoral College reason why is because it keeps all the votes for the presidential election and etc. And each or any electors in your state has his or her own group of electors. And the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what is their responsibilities are. But the Electoral College it consists or has 538 electors but the majority is to have 270 s that you can vote for the president. By the way once you have voted for the president or senate or governer etc. The system will count how many popular votes or from a vote from Congress and the qualified citizens. But my reason for the electoral college to stay is that once you have voted you can count from the system or it does it for you but if you dont want the electoral college then it will take alot longer for the votes to be process and be accumilated.

Well so there's people or citizen that want the electoral college to keep going but some don't reason to that is in the story this is what it says, ""The electoral college  is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostky assertins withoout much basis in reality"". And its unfair cause it has the winner take all system in each state. And they sometimes have problems getting the votes from some states and they couldn't see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And the story says from someones opinion ""And the arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality."" And once a state has voten it  counts as 1 vote.

And some people and the people from the government or like congress,senators,representatives, and more hope that one day while they are voting that the score or number of votes is not a tie. But some citizens arn't into the technology of the electoral vote or how it works. But in that case I would like to not want the electoral collge to keep going mostly due to unfairness, outdated,irrational.

Since the electoral college is still working the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national elction, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible  American popluation did vote in 2012's election.                            ",1,3.0,3.0,,":

00ef89f,"In my ophion, technology reading students emotional expressions is the dumbest thing ever and here is why.

First, the apps they are using just changes the student indivaully like you can not make someone be happy on a computer you can make them look happy they should not change someone for who they want them to be vs what they are. Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles. Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse. Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things. Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day.

In Conclusion, I think changing someones pictures to make them look like they are happy is the wose idea ever because deep down they know they are, but do you just because someone makes and upset face dosnt always mean they are.",1,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

01267d1,"The Face was dicovered on May 24, 2001. It was discovered by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" But the Face is just a natural landform discovered on Mars by NASA.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the face. It was discovered that there was no alien monument. On paragraph seven, the text states, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos....There was no alien monument after all."" This proves that they found out the Face was not an alien monument.

But many people were still not satisfied so, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor went to Mars for a second look. On paragraph ten, the text states, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" On paragraph twelve, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" So, the Face that they found on Mars was just a natural landform after all.

Using evidences from the texts, we learned that the Face was discovered on May 24, 2001. We learned that many people believed it to be an alien monument, but it was not. The Face got looked a second time, on April 8, 2001, but with the camera's absolute ""maximum resolution.""

Goodmoring senator before I start , I would like to ask how are you doing and how's your family. I hope everybody health is great and family problems. Today I want to talk to you about some little problem that's not going as well as I thought it was going to go. Electoral College is not a good idea for us citizens. Because everybody in this country that works and come from another country , should be able to vote for their President. The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? The presidential election most have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.

According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was  the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Also  voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!

In conclusion, The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism , a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. This is all I wanted to tell you , I hope you listen to what I'm trying to tell you. I know I am not the only one that thinks like this. If you would like to contact me back you could email me at EMAIL_ADDRESS. Thankyou and have a great day!

To begin with under the 23rd amendment of the constitution ,""The District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college"" and for that saying , in the  following discussion , the  word state also refers to the district of columbia. Also Each and every candidate that is running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.""

Foremost , under the electoral college system , voters vote not for the persident , but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president.""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the  first place? it depends on the state. Now i understand sometimes at state conventions , Partys , central committee , sometimes the presidental candidates themselves , Also sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the electoral college is what we might call the  disaster factor. Its Basically whenever theres a  really good argument thats what its called.

Subconstantquintly , Sometimes most people worry about the prospect of a tie in the elections vote. ""In That case , the election would be thrown to the house of representatives , where state delegations vote on the president."" At the most basic level , the electoral college is unfair to voters. ""because of the winner-take-all system in each state , candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning , focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Then now its official "" The electoral college is unfair , outdated , and irrational."" The best arguments in favor of it in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

060a4e7,"In the passage the Author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit desite the dangers it presents. In the first paragraph the author says ¨Venus, sometimes called the Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.¨. In that quote it is saying that the Evening star is so bright that someone is not really paying attention could see it because it is so bright it can not be missed. It is also saying that it is one of the brightest points of light which means if you are lost you could look up and hopefully see that star and it will give you some light to find your way. Another quote from paragraph one is ¨However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun¨. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it. In paragraph two it says ¨Often referred to as Earths ¨twin¨, Venus is the closest planet to earth in tearms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance to earth¨. In that quote it is saying that Venus is known as Earths twin because of the size. The Earth and Venus are about the same size. It also says that Earth and Venus have about the same density as each other. In my opinion I think that the planets should all be different sizes and densities because of the fact that everything is different. When it comes to planets they should all be different sizes, so that people can easily point out the planets and be able to name them easily and not get them mixed up because of them looking the same size in the atomosphere. In the passage in paragraph three it says ¨A think atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankes Venus¨. In this quote it states that most of Venus is covered in carbon dioxide. If scientists wanted to go study Venus they would have to have many layers of protection on because carbon doxide can be very harmful to the human body. Especially since the carbon dioxide percentage is so high it can extrmely hurt the human body of anyone that goes to Venus to study it. My thoughts on this topic are that if they want to study it they should send up a professional to put something on Venus that can dectect any movement or anything on the planet. They should do that so the scientists wanting to study Venus can study it from a safe distance and out of harms way.",1,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

I would like it if you would just keep the Electoral college because it would be so much easier to pick a president then if we the people had to pick the president. If we screw up and pick the wrong president then its our fault, but if you all pick the president it'll be your fault if the president turns out to be good or not. Besides the founding fathers founded the Electoral college so we should keep it just for their sake. Anyway the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors which then when there picked they decide who is the new or repeating President of the United States of America. The reasons I would like to see the Electoral college do good is because the first reason as to why you should just keep the Electoral college is because everyone will want to be president heres an example .The Electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal.

They can help us break a tie between two competing candidates that want to become presidents of the United States. You may not think its a big deal but it is. I don't like the ""winner-take-all"" system, I find it unfair that the president can automatically win a vote from one state. They need to get use to the voting system instead of winning one automatically. The one thing I like about the voting system is that people can pick who would be the best candidate for our nation. For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation. Now back on to the subject, the Electoral College can be important to the system. The bad side of the Electoral college is that under its system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect for the president. The singel best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Us Americans should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.

Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020! The cars that Google has had since 2009 have driven more than half a million miles without a single crash. They alert drivers when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

One negative question I have for these driverless cars is, ""Whats the point of having these cars if you still need a driver""? New laws will be needed in order to cover liabilty in case of an accident. ""If technology fails and someone gets injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer? This requires human skills which means humans have to be alert at all time in case of emergency. These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads.

""In 1980's automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. These sensors are in need of improvements so that these driverless cars can be capable to handle more of the driving task that can lead to dangerous accidents. The 1980 cars had become more advanced to detect respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. IN the end these cars just need a lot of sensors so they can sense when things are about to occur.

Today i've talked about three different preview points. In the first body paragraph I talked about the positive upside of the driverless cars. In the second paragraph I had a dicussion about negative effects on driverless cars. With my third body paragraph I ended with talking about smarter cars and their sensors. I really hope you've enjoyed the conversation about these so called driverless cars coming in the future!      ",1,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

And 75% sold there car just to move here. Its easier for citys to walk and drive around somewhere. Its easy now to get where you need to go if you walk because they made stores close by so you can walk to them.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. If you had a even or odd license plate one day you werent aloud to drive that day you had to wait. But some people did not follow this rule about 4,000 drivers were fined. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after having some of the people not drive and after five days of intensifying smog. Cold night and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap in car emissions. What they are doing is really good because this could help people not drive as much.

Bogota,Colombia people hiked,biked,skated or took buses to work during a car free day. It was the third straight year cars have been banned. Only buses and taxis were allowed for work and transportation. Even when it had rained they didnt care they still kept walking. Parks,Sport centers and shopping stores have gotten alot better because of the people walking. For a very first time Colombian cities ,Cali and Valledupar joined this event too.1990's is when they started a day without cars in Bogota.

Trying to make less people drive now a days. President Obama's goals is to curb the united states greenhouse gas,it says americans are buying fewer cars ,fewer licenses and driving each year.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditios by staying up and out of their way.

Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable.

Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.

It is one of the brightest points in the sky because it looks like a star, although it is considered a planet. It is also the second planet from are sun in our solar system. The nickname ""Evening Star"" is misleading since it is actually a planet.

It is often considered to be Earth's twin becaise it, in terms, has the same terms of density and size and is occasionally the closest planet in distance. Since Venus is right around the corner, in space terms, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on the planets cloud draped world. Each of the previous missions were unmanned, and that was for a good reason, since no spacecraft could survive for more than a few hours there.

Most of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide. What is even more challenging is the cloud that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid, which are also located in the atmosphere. The temperature let alone would kill a person right on contact. The temperature is 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than what we have ever experienced on are planet.

So although Venus is a pretty cool planet, it can be a dangerous on too because of the misleading name, the planet being considered Earth's twin, and for the atmosphere being outragingly different than ours here on Earth. ",1,4.0,4.0,,":

I am writting this letter on behaf of my feelings on changing the election by popular vote.

The single best argument against the electoral collage is what might be what we (the american people) might call the disastor factor, We should consdier ourselves lucky that in the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a centry; the system can allow much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)

""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives. Where state deleations vote on the president, and the senate would choose the vice-president. At the most basic level, he electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state.

Canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campain, seventeen sates didnt see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campain ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it... Originally the founding fathers estabished the electoral college in the Constitutuin as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress but i believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational! Some of the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality

154607a,"The claim that the author supports the idea that studing Venus is worth pursuit despite the dangers because they maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decade. The dangers and pursuit are higly high risks for people and NASA.It is dangers because Venus is the secound planet from our sun and the atmosphere in Venus is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets. Even more challenging is that the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. On the plant surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. The despite to go Venus is that they are hoping to look for something their because the plant has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains,and craters. Somethings that we some how have they call Venus Earths sister. That why I think it so despite that NASA wants to see what else Venus got that the plants sister does not have.

An explanation of the article that supports my claims are when the author says this ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Also when they said ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""Venus is also dangers for people because it has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to our sun.""Beyond high pressure and heat,Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

My conclusion to the authors writting is that they will not end up sending people to Venus because its to risky. They will end up sending newer technoligi up their so that they could see what the sister of Earth got. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth -like planet in our solar system. Venus is most likely the most compared planet to Earth.

Dr. Paul Eckman (a psyhologist) is the creator of The Facial Action Coding System. The software was made by prof. Thomas Huang (of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science) in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe(of the University of Amsterdam). The FACS was used to be able to read emotions in percentage. It was able to read six emotions hapiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness due to their 44 major strands of muscles on a humans face.

The way that FACS was able to read your emotions are like complicated math equations. The 44 strands each have different meanings each movement of one or more muscles are called ""action unit"". The frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyebrows) raises your eyebrows when your surprised and your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. The use of FACS have been use on the Renaissance Painting Mona Lisa by Leonardo da vinci to show expressions that only that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery.

Dr. Huang wanted to test a painting called Mona Lisa, (i'm sure you know of it or heard something about it. Well Dr. Huang tested her faced because she smiles a little and he seen that she's not just happy she has six different emotions all together. She 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How does this work?

1. **Development of Point of View and Critical Thinking (Score: 3)**
The essay attempts to discuss the topic of showing emotions through a computer but lacks depth and clarity. The example of Dr. Huang testing emotions through a computer is interesting but not fully developed. The essay could benefit from more analysis and explanation of how emotions can be detected by a computer. Additionally, the transition to discussing the Mona Lisa painting feels abrupt and disconnected from the main point. The critical thinking is somewhat limited and could be strengthened by providing more relevant examples and explanations.

2. **Organization and Focus (Score: 3)**
The essay lacks a clear organizational structure. The introduction is vague and does not effectively introduce the topic. The shift to discussing Dr. Huang and the Mona Lisa painting feels disjointed and could be better integrated into the overall argument. The conclusion is also abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. To improve, the essay should have a more coherent flow of ideas and a stronger thesis statement to guide the reader.

3. **Language Use (Score: 3)**
The language use in the essay is somewhat informal and lacks precision. There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the essay that hinder clarity. For example, ""well not to long ago"" should be ""well, not too long ago."" Additionally, there are issues with punctuation and sentence structure that affect the overall readability of the essay. To enhance language use, the student should focus on using more formal language and improving sentence structure for better coherence.

4. **Grammar, Usage, and Mechanics (Score: 3)**
The essay contains numerous errors in grammar, punctuation, and mechanics that detract from the overall quality of writing. For instance, there are issues with subject-verb agreement (""he seen"" should be ""he saw""), tense consistency (""tested his emotions"" should be ""tested emotions""), and sentence structure (""Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when your surpried"" should be revised for clarity). To improve, the student should pay closer attention to grammar rules and proofread the essay for errors before submission.

Overall, the essay demonstrates developing mastery but falls short in several key areas such as organization, critical thinking, language use, and grammar. To enhance the essay, the student should focus on developing a clearer argument, improving organization, using more formal language, and addressing grammatical errors for a more cohesive and polished piece of writing.",2.0

Viking 1 took a picture of something call a butte or mesa. They're most common in the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars. Their is one in the Snake RIver Plain in Idaho.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

So Luke let people from other places stay at his home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with him for the rest of his days. Like he said it was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Being a

Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky. LIke he said,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."" And the awareness stayed with him, he became a host for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever!

1b7e42c,"Alien Landform?

Do you think that the face on Mars is real or was created by an alien? As being a scientist, I dont think the face is real because Mars is not a living planet. Many of the planets in the solar system have different types of landforms in general. There is alot of evidence on how it could be many things and how it could have been made. Down below will be some evidence on how I think that the face on Mars is not real.

First, in paragraph two it said that the ""Face"" looks like a human face. ""An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Carpet Planet called Cydonia."" This could have meant that the camera was just put where the ""Face"" may have been looking at directly. there are many ways how this could just be a huge rock at a certain angle being a ""Face"".

Secondly, in paragraph 7 it states another thing about the type of landform. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . .a natural landform."" This states that there was no alien monument after all. That was another thing about how the ""face"" could have been a natural landform like how any other planet has.

Next, we all know how many people read magazines and watch movies. In paragraph 5 it states that the ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. 'It has started in a Hollywood film, apperared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" The defenders of the NASA budget wsh there was an ancient civilization on Mars. People were saying that NASA was trying to cover something up. Maybe some people dont think that its true so and that they need more information to let people know after they have found alot of information.

Now, their is a possibility that there is aliens on Mars. In paragraph 8 it claims, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face but perhaps they were alien markings that werre hidden by haze. ""It could have just been the camera that was not capturing them right. it also states how they dont pass over the face very often as in they are thinking that the ""Face"" might move like aliens. But, there is not enough evidence that this is a natural landform or an alien face. It even states how it could even be a lava dome that took form on the isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars that was on another planet.

In conclusion, I don't think that the aliens are real. I won't think that until they have an extradanary amount of evidence stating that is is a face. NASA has made alot of mistakes in the past and maybe this is one of those mistakes.             ",1,3.0,3.0,,":

1dee883,"Venus also sometimes called ""the evening star"" is consider one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is considered a ""twin"" to Earth because it is the second planet from sun and becuse it is the closest to Earth in size and density and also the closest in distance.

Venus also neighbors other planets an example is in paragraph 2 ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These diferences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to Venus. because Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""

Venus has surface temperatures that are up to ""800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and the atmosphere is ""90%"" stronger than what we experience on earth. Venus also makes up ""97% of carbon dioxide"" so we would not be able to breath with also the planet being to hot to step on. they have also had unmanned missions on Venus for example in paragraph 2 ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" NASA is also working on some other approaches to study Venus for example in paragraph 7 ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamer simulating the chaos of Venus's surface aand have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.""

1e1d55f,"Dear Florida Senator,

Would you like to vote, or do you feel obligated to vote? I personally want my vote to make a difference. I would want to keep the Electoral College because it expess others to vote and to have freedom of speech of knowing which candidate would be better to control our world of which we live in.  If you are willing to vote, choose carefully and be percise with your answer. Don't let others get in your way, it's your choice and time, so express a political preference rather than deciding an election.

First of all, voting is all about the candidates, try to understand and know the candidates before voting. ""Voters sometimes get confused about the elctors and vote for the wrong candidate."" If you didn't know the candidates and voted the wrong candidate, then your vote may make a difference and you would have to wait patiently for four years intill your able to vote again for a different candidate.

Secondly, If you don't want to waste your time and thinking that your vote would not make a difference, then I'm sure others feel the same way. ""A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does."" Every state should get the equal amount of attention then any other state, and it should all be about the electors by sharing their own opinions.

Thirdly, Candidates should think about their electors and keeping this world safe and sercure for us rather than just wanting to be in the white house. ""Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" It's great that the candidates are appreciative by the electors and wanting our vote to count.

In conclusion, we cannot control electors who wants to vote for a candidate that others may dissagree on, but we can control our own vote.

It's your decision whether to vote or not and who do you approve for. Your vote can make a difference and every bit counts. So there is a reason to have the Electoral College.         ",1,3.0,3.0,,,"and awkward phrasing, at times obscure the meaning of the essay. **Constructive Feedback:** Focus on improving grammar and mechanics through careful proofreading and editing to enhance clarity and precision in writing.

21d86cc,"scientist wanna learn more about the planet venus to see how it is and if it really is the closest planet to earth there is in this solar system.

The planet Venus is a difficult planet to search because earth has sent multiple missions for it unmanned because no spacecraft survied the landing more than a few hours. A spaceship has not touched down into Venus in more than three decades. The reason why its hard is because venus atmosphere is very thick, its 97% carbon dioxide. Also the clouds of venus have sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere. The average temperature in venus is usually 800 degrees Fahrenheit. the pressure of the atmosphere is 90 times greater than what we have in our own planet, that type of pressure could crush anything.

the reason they wanna know more about venus is because astronomers wanna learn more about the planet. the reason they are so curious is because its the closest earth like planet in our solar system. They say that long ago venus had an ocean and could have had various forms of life in it. the way astronomers wanna learn more about it is by using a blimp like vehicle that hovers around 30 miles floating above the venus landscape.

This technology can recognize emotions like the Leonardos da Vinci's renissance painting, Mona Lisa, she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe. The process beings when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model

of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions, happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. The facial expressionsfor each empotion are universal. By weighting the different units, the softwere can even identify mixed emotions. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For intance, you can problably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of, course most of us woulld have trouble actually describing each facial tarit. While it shows just how much this computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. Acordinng to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.

mars globe surveyspace craft revealed the face of mars is a mesa (intro) ,scientists found it was just another martian mesa(2).

A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a “huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.” The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars(3).

on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.(7)

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001—a cloudless summer day in Cydonia—Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. “We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,” said Garvin. “Malin’s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera’s absolute maximum resolution.” Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo(10).

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa—landforms common around the American West. “It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,” says Garvin. “That’s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.”(12).therefore there is no alien life forms on other planets.

After the presidential elction, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""  listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state, as well as the names of their respective electors

STATE SENATOR

I believe that the

Electoral College is a good thing. The way that the world has created it now is simply significant. It is like the last ray of sunshine in an empty tunnel. Don't try to get into what the others say about the way that the president should be elected. We are building the future, rock by rock, well we just picked up a brick.

The

Electoral College is not a place( even though it has ""college"", in it's name), it is a  process as stated in the 1st source . ""WHAT IS THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE""?

""The

Electoral College is a process, not a place .

The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a  compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"". As you can see, there is no reason to change it so that the president gets his votes by poularity. It might have been good as a teenager but just remember that this is not your Highschool ""PROM"", you dont just win by fame. Being the president is hard work. If you wish to be president, dont jog for it, run for it.

Now future presidents out there just remember that you will required to have a canidate as stated in source 2 . ""THE INDENSIBLE ELECTORAL COLLEGE:WHY EVEN THE BEST-LAID DEFENSES OF THE SYSTEM ARE WRONG""

? ""The electoral college requires a preisdental candidt to have trns-region appeal. No region(South, Northeast,etc.)has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romeney was in the South, has no incentive to campain heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pluality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result becaus a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"". This shows that in order to be an amazing president you need a canidate.

I am in keeping things the way that we have it now. IT is like  why find a needle in a haystack, whe you could buy one and not go through all off that pain.

So just do not waste your own time on something that do not need to be done. It like why buy a lighter, when you have a perfectly well conditioned box of matches in your house. So dont go 18 century go 21 century.

well an Electoral college is not somewhere you go to like a regular college but its a process ,

they established it in constitution as a compromise.

Its where they vote for presidents and vice president including the electoral votes by congress ,

Electoral college consists 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the president .

To begin with, every candidate is running for President for your state ,and each of them has their own electors .

After every four years presidential election is held on tuesday after the first monday ,

the fun part is that most states gets a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate ,

also your governer prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""

listing all the wonderful candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors .

This year most voters are expecting another close election in the population vote which winners could again lose the presidency.

Under electoral college system some voters don't vote for presidents but vote for a state of electors , if you lived in texas for an example and wanted to vote for someone named John kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry .

For the winner-take-all method of the award electoral votes induces the candidates just like in 2012 election .Obama won the vote and got 29 electoral votes ,a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in the campaign

Nixton in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 pecent plurality of popular votes .

2d01aef,"The Electoral College is a process in which each person running for President has his/her own group of electors who are chosen by their political party. In my opinion I believe that the Electoral College should not be kept because,it's not fair that the citizens only get to choose who is their president and who his party choose as Congress, they should  be able to choose who helps the president run the country. The President basically just signs the papers that can pass a law but the Congress helps say if the law should pass or not.

People should be able also to choose who they want in Congress beacuse, people want a Congress that they know and trust to help our country turn into a better place. Sometimes the Congress only do what they want and feel is right. The Congress that the party choose may also be people that they like and believe will follow how they feel which may not be  how the citizen feel. I know 538 pepole are alot to vote for and add the president, mayors,and commisioners etc., but atleast we'd have the freedom to pick who we want to help run country and we'd also know they'd try and help make our country amazing. Even if it's part of the Constitution they can change it a little like they alot of other things in it.

In conclusion people should be able to vote because then we'd be able to choose,so they could feel better about knowing who is passing laws and fixing their country. I may be under age but, I know if I were allowed to vote I'd want to vote for who runs my country and who helps run it.                ",1,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

It can be argued that the electoral  college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas for example or republicans in california knowing their vote will have no effect they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by popular but of course no voters vote swings a national election and in spite of that about one half the elgible american population did vote in 2012 election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote in 2012's election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney .  . . . because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number but it is higly unlikely .....

I think those two paragraphs from this passage explains why i would like for people to just do popular voting because it makes the people comfortable and who they feel will make a america as best as it can be. That person who is being elected should feel proud and make america safe is what i stronlgy agree and i think others should to because it is a great choice. The elctoral college consist of the selection of the electors the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress and i feel like thats a little too much when people can just vote instead of getting someone as a president who their not comfortable with or familiar with and dont know anything about the person so everyone just vote by the people for the people.

31e4327,"The Challenge Of Exploring Venus

My Claim that

support the passage is "" Do Not Judge A Book By It Cover"" despite the facts that venus is one of the brightest points in the night sky, it was simple for amateur stargazer to spot. Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and closest in distance. The only difference between the venus and earth is the speed because sometimes we are closer to venus because it is always around the corner.

No spacecraft has ever survived landing on venus. Venus is marked as the challenging planet for human despite the promixity and the similarities they both share. There is 97%

carbon

dioxide which bblankets venus and it is more challenging due to the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure in venus is more greater than what we experience on earth and also it has the hottest surface.

According to Paragraph 4, the astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. Venus was for once looks like earth which includes different oceans and some rocky sediments which partains to mountains and valley. Eventhough venus is no more condusive for human being it is still consider as one of nearest option for planetary visit for humans. NASA are compelling ideas for sending human to study venus. The possible solution for NASA to study will allow the scientist to fly above the fray. If blimp-like vehicle hovering above the venus was created this would be of help to the astronants to complete their research because the vehicle won't come down to the surface of the venus that low, but there would be a lot of solar power and radiation so that the condition can be survivable for the humans.

If a ship orbiting safely above the venus is created this wouid

help to provide some insight about the ground conditions because most form of light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere so this will render any form of photography in effective and also things cannot be picked from the surface of the venus, so with this scientist is planning to conduct a thorough

mission to understand venus would need to get up close despite the challenges they're going to face. According to

paragraph 7, NASA is working on other approaches to study venus examples are some simplified electronics made of silicon and also using the mechanical computers to study the surface of the venus but using a modern computer can be delicate because of the the risk it entakes.

Finally, for scientist to study the Venus they need to create some powerful equipments that can be of help to them. Venus is large but due to the risk, it is made difficult for scientist to study it.   ",1,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

326c204,"Luck Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Don Reist his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

He said yes right then he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke signed up with his friend Don.

Before arriving in Greece, Luke turned 18 years old, which meant he could be drafted for military service.

When his draft board learned he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to keep doing that for his service.

By the time he was discharged in 1947, he had made 9 trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for Luke.

Besides helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work, but not for dangers at sea.

He couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke.

It opened the world up to him.

He is grateful for the opportunity.

It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

The awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.      ",1,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

3333188,"Dear Senator Im writing you this letter to let you know that I argue with you of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus  two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight  races in the ""swing"" sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

3380b17,"Is this something that kids in History class want to hear their teacher talk about? How Mona Lisa felt? I do not think so , but an art class might want to hear about it.

This should not be taught in a history class. This should be tought in an Art room setting. Like Painting class or Drawing class. The reason I say that is because painting and drawing are alike in some ways. In painting you use paint to ""draw"" your assignment. In drawing you use a pencil,sharpie,or a marker to draw your assignment.

If this was a requirement in History class,this subject would be very boaring and irrelevent in so many ways. But in Art since Leonardo da Vinci painted this there could be an entire lesson on it. Then the teacher could have the students draw/paint Mona Lisa

So I think it should not be tought in any other class than Art. The reason I say that is a lot of kids have at least seen this painting one time in their life. And if they take Art they will learn about it. So there is no sense in wasting time in other classes when they will just learn about it in Art class. I do not think some kids would like to have their emotions read on some type of computar software.   ",1,3.0,3.0,,":

It was a very clear picture of a face looking back at the camrea. The photo shows a gray piee of land with some bumps that look like they can be facial features.

It became very popular. It was in movies magazines grocrey stores, and even talkshows. It caused a really big scene. People were arguing weather its right or not. Between people deciding weather its real or not. NASA was trying to get more images of it. So they can finally see what it is.

People got alot of ideas on what it might be. An alien, ghost or maybe even another human race. They waited pationtly/ impationly for them do release new pictures for more proof. People were longing for more answers, so Garvin gave it to them.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to get some better pictures. So on a cloudless day, Garvin took a picture, revealing that ot was just a landform and not an actual face.

But he also said it is very hard trying to hard to pass over that face and they dont pass over ot very often.

34bcca0,"The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Becjman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions? How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?. These process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all the major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. These program can really help teachers to figure out how thier students are feeling.

Nuci Sebe of the University of Amsterdam Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. These new process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major musvloes in the model must moke like human muscles. movement of one or more muscles is calle an ""action unit"". as an examole six classified basic emotions six basic emotions as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements

of the facial muscles.

Can we actually calculate emotions? the facial expressions for each emotion are universal. The new emotion recogniton sfotware tracks these facial movements in the real face or the painted face of Mona Lisa. For example each expression is compared against a neutral face.In fact we humans perfroms this same impressive calculation. As the last example a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson.

How can a cumputer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? the new computer software stores a similar anatomical information as electronic code that allows the computer to describe the feeling that are beings expressed while the picture was taken. In fact are the instructions for a face that looks happy. It's all about those muscular action units.

In Vauban, Germany, residents of this upscale comunnity are surburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

In Bogota, Columbua, there is a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hikes, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

For the most part she is happy you can tell she is happy becaus ehshe is smilling in the picture. What you can not see is the other emtions such as disgust or fear or angry. So how can the author really say that she is all those things if she. although it could be a fake smile you never know. That is like everyday life a person could look happy but really be sad or mad about something you never really know how a person is feeling unless they personally tell you. Facial expression are a big part of our world. As the author states, ""Even though indivulas often show varying degress of expression for example not smiling broadly.""

What I stated in my paragraph befor was that you may tell somebody that your really close with you feelings but then be smiling or not showing any emtion at all. The author states it later in the article. He states "" you can probalby tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Us as humans have a hard time showing emotion or descrinbing our emtions . Although this painting is meant to bring a smile to your face it shows how much technolgy plays a big part in this as well.

3bbcac0,"The president of the United States should be decided by the Electoral College process, not by most popular vote. There are many reasons why we should keep the way we vote the same.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in it's Congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of Representatives and plus two for your senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. When we vote this way, there's a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign effforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Ellectoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constistution.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

We definatly need to continue using the Electoral College process. The most popular vote process wouldn't be an ideal way to elect a president.    ",1,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then he thought, that would be the opportunity of his lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. He also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together.

Luke turned 18 when he was onthe cattle boat headed towrds Greece, and that meant he could be drafted to the military services! By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke Bomberger had made nine trips, then he got told that he had the most Seagoing Cowboys trips in the program!

Luke always said ""the cattle-boat trips were so unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy!"" Besides helping people Luke had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special, Luke said. He enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up his world to help people and be kind and helpful to people who need help.

3df555a,"Unmasking the Face on Mars

By Dariontai White

Do you think that the face is from an Alien? I do. and if you keep reading i can tell you why.

I think it's just a human from a long time ago. My evidence is this quote from the text ""NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible lamding sites for its isster ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" This quote explains its self, and thats's why i think its a human.

I think it just a natural landform, and i got a quote to back it up. My quote is ""Thousands of anxious we surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" and that quote tells you that it was a natural landform after all.

My last reason why I think its a landform is because of the quote that say's ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent ro a buttle or mesa - landforms common around the American West.""

In conclusion, if anyone ask me what I think it is My answer would be a natural landform, and if they ask me how do i know i have evidence.",1,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

3e1faa5,"Not one human has ever seen a living species in Mars or in any planet. In 1976 an odd feature appeared on Mars. Many people think that it looks like a human face. These people believe that the odd feature could be an alien living on Mars.

The news has been spreading around that the ""face on Mars"" is a creature living in space. I don't believe that aliens are real. Aliens are a figure that someone made up a long time ago hoping that their were more people in the Universe. I know this because if there were aliens in the Universe, someone probably would have already found one.

A lot of odd objects float around in space. The face that people are seeing could just be a meteor. Meteors float around the Universe just trying to make problems. The meteor could have blasted into Mars and created the face like feature. Things like this are not very rare. Meteors have rocketed into Earth a great number of times.

I also believe in Jesus. I believe in every single detail the Bible says. The face could be Jesus showing people that he is watching us. Everything in the Bible has either already happend or will happen in the future. Aliens are not in the Bible, therefore, I don't believe they exist.

If aliens really do exist we would have already found one. Humans have thought aliens are real for hundreds of years. The object could be a natural object like a meteor. Meteors pass through the Universe every single day. What makes this object different? Nothing make the object different. Jesus Christ has all of the creatures we need to know about in the Bible.

Venus could have a lot we didn´t think it had, but no one, including myself, have ever study the planet at all. But we can now and see what lies in the planet known as Venus.

First off, Venus is one of the brightest points of light, making it simple for stargazers. Often called the Ëvening Star"" but the nickname can be misleadinng since the planet Venus is...well a planet. While also very simple to see from the distant safe advantage of Earth, it proves to be a very challenging place to examine more closer. It makes you wonder what´s even that planet to study about.

Next, Venus´ surface has their temperature average over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our planet. The planet´s conditions Venus has is way more extreme than we thought it would be that we wouldn´t be accustomed to the second we even try to get there. Beyond the high pressure and the heat, Venusian geology and weather present some impediments like volcanoes that can erupt, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to seek land onto its surface. No wonder why Venus is fascinatiing in some people´s eyes.

Lastly, going over to Venus with a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only have a limit insight on ground conditions since most of the forms can´t penetrate the dense atmosphere. It´s important to know that researchers cannot take samples of any rock, grass, or anything else in the distance.

4b96296,"I am for driverless cars, because they could be helpful, they seem safe, and they are already being used by Google. They could help people with disabilities that make them unable to drive or go where they need to go.

First of all, they are using sensors in them to help navigate them. They are developing special roads, smart roads. There were test tracks built in the 1950's by General motors. They built a concept car that could run on a special track that was embedded with a electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineers at Berkeley tried something similar. They used magnets with alternating polarity, so the car could read the polarities using the binary code. All of this was proved to be too expensive. They started putting sensors on the cars, postion-estimating sensors, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor.

Second of all, they seemed far away from making a driverless car. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assiatant."" The car would be able to handle driving at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors makes sure the drivers keeps ahold of the wheel. Most of these cars are yet to be fully driverless, they can steer, accelerate, and brake on their own, but they all are designed to notify the driver when the rooad ahead requires human skills. Some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays would be turned off instantly when the driver needsto take over, this way the in-car system is acctually a safety feature.

Third of all, The only problem is that there are laws prohibiting the uses and testing of driverless cars. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all time. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe. Traffic laws will have to change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. Automakers are still continuing with their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.

Therefore I am for driverless cars, because they could be helpful, they seem safe, and they are already being used by Google. There's no telling what's to come from the future of driverless cars. ",1,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

"" As an official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg is a credible source for information regarding transportation in America. However there are places all around the world were automobiles are causing problems. Limiting car usage could help solve many of those issues.

In America, the topic of alternative transportation has been  discussed many times, but in previous bills, 80% of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport. This can be found in paragraph 9 of the first source as the fifth line. Sadly America is not the only country having problems. In

Paris, France , diesel cars make up 67% of the vehicles and the diesel feul is blamed for the smog accumulation in the city. In Paris, A warmer layer of air caused by cold nights and warm days, trapped the car emissions which then caused a five day period of intensifying smog. France's smog build-up rivaled that of

Beijing, China , which is claimed to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. This problem also exists in the States, as transportation is the second largest cause of America's emissions, right behind power plants. To ensure safety anyone who was still driving their car was fined 22- euros or $31.

Bogota, Columbia followed France in their violation fee and charged any violater $25. Bogota has created a

Day Without Cars , in which no cars are used, to promote alternative transport and the reduction of smog levels. Another positive effect no cars can have would be a more peaceful enviroment, as stated in sources 1 and 3. In America, recent studies show that Americans have been buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Although it may be far in the future, America may soon follow the lead of

Vauban, Germany , where it is completely car-free. This probably won't happen anytime in the near future, but the use of automobiles has gone down in the United States. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor company, proposed a city in which, pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, etc. are used to save time, lower emissions and improve safety. He sees this future, hopefully others will too.

Although America might not be exactly like Vauban, it is good to hope that it will get there someday. No cars would result in a calmer atmosphere and a more peaceful lifestyle. Also, it would lower the emissions made by vehicles, which in turn would save the atmosphere, thus saving life on earth. No cars would also help improve safety, both of animals and of people. We may not be completely there yet, but the world will someday have no need for cars and that will be the first step into the future.    ",2,4.0,4.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

0c82120,"I think that the Face they saw in 1976 was just a natural landform. I will be giving you at least 4 reasons why that's my conclusion. After you have listened to my reasons hopefully you will then think the same.

My first reason why I think it was just a natural landform is becasue first of all I am a scientist and I'm not suppose to think aliens and that kind of stuff exist. Secondly, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of Cydonia for the first time all they saw was just a natural landform. One of my other reasons why is becasue we thought it was just a Martian mesa, witch are very common in Cydonia. My last reason is becasue with the 3D high-resolution images from NASA's MGS it shows that it was just a mesa.

Those were all my reasons why I think it was a natural landform not an alien. Hopefully now you agree with me and think it was just a natural landform too. Also I hope that you have come to your senses and now think that aliens are not real.       ",2,4.0,4.0,,":

I was prepared for this question and replied,"" Well, in this program you have to help take care of the animals, like horses and young cows, to cross the oceans.""

I felt like that sentence didn't have enough information, so I added,""World War II has ended and we need to assist other countries that have been affected by the war.""

""WIll it be boring?"" One man asked from the back of the crowd. All eyes were on me, their gazes intent on what I was about to say.

I stopped and mulled over my thoughts before answering,""Well, not really. You would be able to see other countries and their landscapes, but you would have to clean the stables and feed the animals. When they are returned to their destination, on the return trips you can have a lot of fun. I had played some sports like baseball and table-tennis with the other boys who had join during one trip back to America.""

""Is it dangerous?"" One person said.

""It can be at time when it's raining extremely hard on deck."" I admitted.

I thought I needed to say more, so I added,""All the adventures you can have will be exciting, but one thing this program has helped me be aware of is the people of other countries and their needs. I played my part in assisting others, will you do the same?""

2d9517a,"I think that driverless cars is something that can potentially make driving a little more safe. Driverless cars are not completely driverless though because they alert the driver when they are needed to take over. Sensors used in cars are also beneficial because they can give information that can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine. Therefore, it allows for a better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Even though driverless cars can do some things on their own, the human driver must still remain alert and be ready to take over when necessary. For this reason, it is necessary for the car to be ready to notify the driver when a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, and the Google car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. These are both ways that can alert a driver when it is time for them to drive, which can help people to be ready to focus while driving.

In conclusion, driverless cars can be beneficial to us and help drivers while they are driving. The drivers of these cars must also be alert as well too. There are sensors and other developments that can help with this process and notify drivers when it is time for them to take control. Everything will not happen right away because it is a process that will take time to be sought through and manufactured correctly. So in the future, maybe we will see more driverless cars then than now and it will be a beneficial way to the driving in our country.   ",2,4.0,4.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 4

2f7eae5,"Dear State Senator,

I think we should change our voting system. Electoral College has it's flaws. We know it's the traditional voting system. It has some unfair advantages. Allow me to explain and convice you to changing our voting system.

Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The electors could be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors will depend on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't always control whom thier electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfairto voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.

The emissions from cars are putting a strain on the health of city air and officials around the world are setting forth the car-less street.

In Germany there is a little suburb called Vauban, which is almost completely car free. While ownership of a vehicle is allowed, the only place someone could park it would be a large garage at the edge of the community, which a space costs around $40,000 to buy. As a result 70 percent of the families ther don't own cars. This new trend is predicted to cut down greenhouse gasses in suburbs and cities, for which cars are resposible. ""Automobiles are the linchpin of of suburbs.... And that, experts say, is a huge impedement to current efforts to drastically reduce gas emissions form tailpipes.... Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of... gas emissions in Europe... and some 50 percent in... the United States.""(In German Suburbs Life Goes on Without Cars by Elizabeth Rosenthal p. 5)

In the Colombian city of Bogota millions of city dwellers hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on a special day called The Day Without Cars. The citizens agree it is a fruitful endeavor, that lowers pollution, releives stress, and provides a great opportunity to excersize.

366ba9d,"I think that emotion calculating technology in a classroom could be very valuable. This technology could help teachers to keep students interested. This could also help to teach students in a way that they enjoy and understand. An advanced technology like this could also help teachers and counselors to know when a student is feeling sad or depressed so that they can possibly help the student. This technology would be very valuable in any classroom, it could be the innovation that every classroom needs.

The FACS (Facial Acting Coding System) works by looking at the 44 major facial muscles. Every different facial muscle movement means something different, and this is what the FACS looks at to give a reading of the different emotions that the person is feeling. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. The FACS machine was invented by Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science. Dr. Huang relies on human psychologists like Dr. Paul Eckman to help decifer the expressions that facial muscles give. Dr. Huang used this technology on Mona Lisa. The readings said that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Using this technology on Mona Lisa is a prime example of how this technology can accurately measure a persons emotions.

This technology could be useful in a classroom in many ways. One way it would be useful, it could measure a students emotions to find out when a student is bored of a subject. This would be useful because if teachers know when a student is bored they could help to make the subject more interesting. Making subjects more interesting in return would raise students grades and happiness in school. This technology could also help counselors. This technology could help counselors by showing themwhen a student is sad or depressed so that they can help the student and also try to fix the problem causing those emotions.

Facial expression reading technology would help classrooms in many ways. This technology could potentially raise student's grades and even help to make students happier. This technology could also make students happier and help then to stay interested and having fun while learning. This advanced technology would be very beneficial to a classroom, it could even change the world of education all together. ",2,4.0,4.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 4

3a74972,"Have you ever heard of the face on Mars? In 1976 the Viking 1 was going around Mars to look for a landing spot for Viking 2. They found something that looked to be a face. It was about 2 miles long in a region called Cydonia. The unusual shadows of the ""face"" made it look almost to be an Egyptian Pharaoh.

The scientists just figured it was another Martian mesa which were common to the region, but the caption took notes of a ""huge rock formation, which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Nasa decided to take a closer look.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture 10 times sharper than the original photo. It turns out it was just a natural landform. Not everyone was happy though, they say it was too cloudy to see if there were any alien markings.

Once again on April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took another picture on a cloudless summer day. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, says ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" The picture was so close that if there were anything on the ground we would've been able to see them. The picture shows the Martian is equivalent of a butte or mesa.

In 1976 the Viking 1 was taking pictures looking for a landing spot for its sister ship Viking 2. The Viking 1 happened to take a picture of a mesa and it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh and everybody believed it was created by aliens. The technology back in 1976 was not as good as it was in 1988 and 2001. When the picture was taken in 1976 it looked like a face. The picture taken in 1988 the picture was more clear and just looked like a mesa. The article says Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture 10 times better than the original in 1976. Cameras' pixels in 1976 spanned over 43 meters. Cameras' pixels in 2001 spanned over 1.56 meters.

Also NASA has way more knowledge about it than people who thnks its an Egyptian Pharaoh created by aliens. The text states scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common around Cyndonia.

Also because the value of the returning of the venus seem to be a little difficult but there was other option to make a mission to be safe and productive to both of them for the astronomers to be by venus and know the planets in the solar system.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosvie sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere because they think that the challenging for venus might not be working for them but now they do work because the conditions are now more extreme then any human encounter out there and all of the environment can crush of a submarine. But then venus has the hottest surface temperature to any of the planet in the solar system that their is even when mercury is close to the sun venus can still be hot for the system being beside another planet.

Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

Throughtout the planet venus the most dangerous planet for humans to live on no animals would survive the conditions venus is in. Venus is important to study for if its still safe for humans to live and how long we can live for,"" The national Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the roiling Venuisan landscape .

Another example of why the author wants pursuit Venus despite the dangers presents.

At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation woukd not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable survivable for humans . That since Venus temperature is higher but has plenty of solar power humans can survive despite how badly the conditions are in.

Secondly The author uses explanation and theory to persuade the readers how we can still explore the planet carefully.

Scientist are willing to study Venus for to test samples of the planet,"" More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges.

Just like earth. Wondering what if Venus has still have the features of having land water animals from a long time ago.

Finally scientist are coming up with ideas that can help thrmj get samples that they need striving to meet the challenges presented, For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Having robotice go first collecting samples for three weeks that can last that long on the planet so scientist can study it from their labs. Another study is that they are looking at other options for robotics to last longer than three weeks,""

That a group of scientist are looking at technology leading back in 1800s because using the old might help because it doen't envolve electronics when using computers today it more delicate when it comes dangerous conditions.

01cbe3d,"Using details from the article, i can write an essay evaluating how well the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by, while yes there are many risks to exploring Venus and other planets but in the long run it could help out. The reason it could help out is if we found a planet near ours like venus that in some way shape or form could be inhabited by humans it could give society and its people more places to go so we dont have as many over populated areas. an other big reason we could benefit from figuring out if venus can be inhabited is if that planet has usefull resources we can stop using as many GMO'S as we do in our foods.

A place that has the biggest issue of having overpopulation and has to resort to using GMO'S in there foods is japan. some places in japan the overpopulation is so bad that it has created a very large increase in the amount of polution that is in the air, Its so bad in some areas that in the morning you can see the polution while just walking which has made it so the kids/adults of japan have to wear some sort of mask to not get sick/ get poisened by the air. If we do end up figuring out that venus and some other planets in our solar system can be inhabited we can decrease this issue by sending some of those people to Venus. It's not only in japan that this issue of overpopuation is occuring, you can see it occuring more and more in the USA with all the refugees and people from other parts of the world coming to live in the USA.

The reason i am making these claims and the information i am using to support my reasoning is, in the text it stated that. "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some of the features that are analogous to those of Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientist can conform that Venus was once inhabited by some sort of life form, they can possibly figure what type of life form this was and maybe figure out why they are no longer there. If they can figure out why that certain life form left or died off we can possibly reverse what had happened. which will lead us to being able to inhabite another planet and could reduce the amount of over population and further problems here on earth by splitting up our population. It could also help the human race live longer and help so that the human race does not die off. In the long run i do think that figuring out if the planet Venus can be inhabited, i also think that from my information and the information that the author gave you to can see the reason why this discovery is so crusual to our society and race.

05aacdb,"The advantages of limiting car usage has errupted since the year 2005. America's love affair with vehicles has been like the love of their children. Most people cant get any where without a car; they begin to believe that without a car you cat go anywhere, but if they look at the bright side America has many uses of transportation such as bus, train, plane, car pool, hiking, skating, bicycle, and walking. By using these ways of transportation many places around the world will find that is much easier then using a car everyday; maybe if we tried to make these federal transportation toals in our city then maybe air polution will decrese or even go away completely. There has been many improvement campaigns around the world such as Bogota's day without cars and Paris's driving ban due to smog. Many counties, cities, and states around the world are finding ways of transportation without cars and we should to. A world without cars is a utopia of a new way of living because many people are much happier this way.

As a result, to a world without cars Vauban, Germany's people has said a life without cars is wonderfull even if it takes a little more time to get places. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families donot own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainor and a mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor""(Rosenthal.3). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal's statistic Vauban's citizens are happy in this new way of life; they have learned that a life without cars can be different' but happier so that they can go through out their busy days without hearing the sound of an ongiong car zooming pass them as they walk the streets of their cities.""Vauban's streets a COMPLETELY car free besides the tram to downtown Feiburg and a few streets on the edge of the community""(Rosenthal.2). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal Vauban's streets being car free is a easier life; there is less traffic while trying to get to work in the morning, or even trying to get home, and picking up your kids in the afternoon.

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer.10). Paris being near pollution has caused them to enforce a partial driving ban on its cities people. In my oppinion Paris going into over pollution would cause it population to die to the lost of many lives because of air pollution. After 5 days of intesifying the smog congestion decresased and there was many people rerouting their daily lifes to acounter the partial ban on their daily lifes. ""On monday many motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day""(Duffer.11). Almost 4,000 motorist were fined that day because they did'nt want to listen to a simple order. Due to the partial ban the congestion of motor vehicles decreased by 60 percent in the capital of france. This ban is a good way to take away the stress of putting gas in your vehicles, finding someone to fix your car when it has broken down and a possible cure to lowering the global effect of air pollution.

As a result, to America's campaigns and organizations to keep U.S. drivers off the street and on public transportation the number of people driving and the number of people getting their license has decresased since 2009. Demographic shifts in the driving population has caused the population of many places around the world to stop driving cars and find new ways to get around. In the United States the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and federal transportation toals, that mattering on its out come, may become a law throught the whole of the United States within the next six years. This law may cause many U.S. citizens to become upset because of the restrictment of something they use through out their daily lifes. Most people in the U.S. think that driving is the only way to get around but there are many ways of transportation mattering on where your going and how fast you want to get there.

08f129d,"Do you know the advantages and the disadvantages of having of not having a car? Yes, actually not having a car. Most people would freak out of the thought of not having a car some are just use to it. But could it actually save more money or would it cost more?

Vauban, Germany people have actually given up their cars, they call it ""car-free."" Not everyone has given up their cars. ""The main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park- large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home""- Source 1 by:Elizabeth Rosenthal. The Vauban's started  getting involved and getting informed on not using a car. Soon 70 percent of Vauban's familiy does not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car to move to Germany. Some even liked the idea of not using a car ""When I had a care I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. She nows walks verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. in 2006 Vauban completed, this is an example of growign trend in Europe, the united States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, this is a movement of ""smart planning."" The advantage is you will have more access to public transportation, a disadvantage is if you live far from public places then you might have to walk or take a bus.

In Paris they have enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even- numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). Nearly 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters. Twenty seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesels engines int he rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. The advantage of not having a car is that you wouldn't be spending money on gas, the disadvanteage is that you will be fined. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made fro plug-in cars, hybirds, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. After the smog ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. There is alot of disadvantages because would you have a work day on Tuesday and you have an odd numbered plate. Also soem people are not familar with the public transportation and some people may not think it's the best way to get around in town. You also have to get up eary to catch the bus, train, etc.

BOGOTA,Colombia- In a program that sets to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or tooked buses to work during a car-ffree day yesterda, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. This was their third staright year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal was to promote alternative  transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. In Bogota there were occasional rain showers . Some thought it was a good idea some not so much. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress in lower air pollution,"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Many countries have tried having a car-free day, and many succeeded. For the Unoted States President Obama ambitious goal was to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assit from incipient shift in American behavior. The studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. In 2005 the United Stes peaked and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company.  As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

So driving with a car or not it either good or bad because not driving could give you the excerise and driving just means you like your personal things. I think that when  the government says it's a fine then follow the rules. Either way not having a car does has it advantages every country should have a car-free day.                                                  ",4,2.0,,,,,"Based on the provided rubrics and the student's essay, here is the evaluation:

09a62eb,"Driverless cars are an advance in technology, even though they are not fully self automatic yet .Driverless cars may not be fully driverless yet but in the future it is possible. Even if people dont like the idea of it its still going to happen. Driverless cars are not going to be any good for our generation.

Driving is something that you will need your full attention for even if the car is self driven it can still screw up. I don't personally see the point of somthing that is not going to help anyone. Chances are that there will be more accidents and more people will be injured or even die because all technology malfunctions at one point or another and there is no stopping that. Technology is a good thing when it is helping people. Times are changing and no one can stop it. In paragraph 9 it says who will be responsible if the car happens to mess up the manufacturer or the driver.

Think to yourself who would you hold responsible. Knowing that all technology malfunctions,not to mention the car would be overly priced just for it to be able to drive without a driver and sense things. Most people like being aware if their surroungings. What if the car stoped and the driverless addition stoped working .You would already be used to not driving and over all forget how to do it. You wouldn't be aware of where you are because you were to busy doing other things then to know your surroundings.

Knowing how to drive makes things easier on you. Technology is not always a good thing. Technology doesn't always work out the way you want it too its easy to look something up and the internet not give you what you want or what's true would you trust your care taking you to where ever? It's easy saying something is better because it has technology incorperated but is that really true.

Some things are better left with out all the added gadgets and I belive a car is one of those things. A car is more reliable when you personaly are controling it. You know where you are going and I think if they want to make additions to are car make tires that don't go flat or make the car fix its self. Knowing how to get places yourself will make things so much easier on you. If your tire goes flat your car can not take you to the nearest area to call someone or get help.

My opinon over all driverless cars help no one. They make nothing easier and will not be affordale for the average person. They will malfunction more then a regular car and make accidents more common.",4,2.0,2.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

0c4ede2,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author gives us positive information and negative information. Different people are going to have different opinons on driverless cars. Some may think it is a good idea while some may think that it is a bad idea. There is no right or wrong answer. It is based on your personal opinion on what you think of driverless cars. I believe that it is kind of dumb to have driverless cars. There are many bad things that can happen with them such as safety hazards, unattentiveness while driving and accidents that may occur with them.

Driverless cars are not a good idea to me. When you drive you always have to be attentive. Driving is already not the safest thing in the world. There is always people walking out in front of you, animals running out in front of you and many other things. If you get a car that can drive for you there is bound to be something bad to happen. A computer is all that the car is. Computers go down all the time in the world and they shut down. What if your car happened to stop working in the middle of the highway where the speed limit is seventy-five miles per hour. There would be many accidents happening if that was the case. There is a positive thing about them though they can help you if you have children in the backseat. If they are acting up and you put your car on autopilot then you can get them to quit arguing. But still it is a very dangerous idea. No way would I trust a car to be able to drive me places when I barely trust myself driving me places. So I don't believe that these cars are one hundred percent safe. I think that there are many safety hazards that they could bring.

I also think that driveless cars are a bad idea because no matter what you have to be attentive. If you look away to the side for three seconds and your driving, your car is already the that side of the road. I believe that if there is going to be television and stero systems in these cars, that people are not going to be paying attention to the road, they are going to be paying attention to the televsion or whatever may be on in theirr car. When I drive I listen to the stero and it distracts me when a good song comes on. I could not imagine what I would be like if I had a television in my car. The good side about these driverless cars with televsion in them is that if you are going on a long road trip with your family and you want to watch televison you could. I know that when I take long road trips I wish that I could bond with the person that is driving. So it would be a good thing for families that had little ones. If the little kids were getting cranky then they could cuddle up next to mommy or daddy or whoever may be driving. But again the driver would not be attentive or aware of there surrroundings if that was to happen. They would probably fall asleep if they were relaxing to much and dozed off.

Finally I believe that these cars can cause many highway or country road accidents. For example, if a family was watching a movie and their was a sudden stop on the road they are most likely going to run right into that person in front of them. If it is a sudden stop there is no way a computer can see that and slam on the brakes. If it could do that though, the person behind the car would probaly get ran into. Like I have said in the beginning all this car is, is a computer. I mean my computer goes down so many times in a day. I would not rely on a computer made car for the life of me. There are already so many accidnets that happen when people are driving, there is no need to add a computer made car and let it make accidents to. I think that for a car to be completely driverless or ninty percent driveless is ridiculous. On the plus side of this if a car that was driveless did happen to work then it would come in handy for long trips on the road. If there was a actual car that got tested and it could go on for hundreds of thousands of miles and not wreck now that would be pretty amazing. But in my opinon I do not think that there is a car that is capable of being able to do that. A car takes human assistance to drive and if it all technology no way could it work effectively. There is going to be accidents if cars become ninty perfect driveless or any percent driveless

This concludes my opinion on driveless cars. I think that they would be a very neat invention but I do not believe for one second that they would work all the tie one hundred percent. I have been driving for a year now and have already been in accidents because I was not paying attention. So I know that being a human and driving is already complicated enough, I do not believe that a computer could handle it. I know that companies are trying their best to make this become an actual thing in the world but I don't think that it is belivable. I think that they could make them, I just do not believe that they would work that great. I am with the idea that there is no way

driveless car is even imaginable. So with the facts I have presented here I am sticking to my topic that driveless cars are the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard of.

0eb0013,"Driverless cars, I feel like its a disaster waiting to happen. As we exploring the world of cars and what they can teach us we will have a few bumps along the way. This is one of those bumps. Driverless cars will defeat the purpose of the 16 year old child earning freedom and driving on his or her own. It's not fair to the current generations that they won't be able to drive like past generations have.

If you pull text from the 8th paragraph it staes rather clearly that it's not really developed the way they wanted it. It's more like roadside assistance. But the driver would get rather bored waiting on his or her turn to drive, if they even get a turn. This is just one of the many negatives of driverless cars. The law in many states say that and driver needs to be present and in control but California, Flordia, Nevada and the District of Columbia are starting to allow it. People out there are starting to believe that it's the next great thing and that all the other states willl follow alot like the rise of homosexuality.

Now don't get me wrong the idea of a driverless cars seems pretty cool and the world would love the change but is it worth it? Think of the thousands of taxi drivers and limo drivers that would be out of work. Think of the people that work at the BMWs, they would be out of jobs and wouldn't be able to provide for the families they have. Is it all worth the unemployment line filling us in busy towns because the cabs have no reason to be driven?

The passage also allows the reader to wonder what would happen if the car malfunctioned. Would it be the drivers fault or the companies fault? This could simply be avoided and that makes lives alot easier and even though you have to go through task of teacher the newer generations to drive wouldn't that be eaier than taking and risk and possibly dying beacuse you wanted to use a driverless car.

The passage also states they've already got a phase A of the driverless car. Google has presented a car that can drive up to 25 miles per hour with no issues until it needs help swearving throughout traffic. Then and only then will the driver be able to control the car. Other than that the car is just a no driver needed car unless a situation happens. This also could upset the driver because they might've wanted to drive but they have to wait his or her turn to control the car. This could also cause many issues and it's a huge possiblity that the car accident rate can and will increase because of the malfuntions of the car.

In short this passage can be connceted to Surealism. This whole idea is a figure of someone's imagination and they thought it would be rather cool to eleminatedivers as jobs. Think of the taxi and limo drivers they will lose jobs if people have driverless cars. It also defeats the purpose of maing the world a btter place because now there will be homeless people and people needing jobs that aren't avalible to them. Do you really think that this sureal idea is the best idea they could come up with?",4,2.0,2.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 2

Sometime the challenge of the planet is for humans to study, apprently it's proximity to us. The author support the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers becuase sometime Venus is right around the corner and human will sent some spacecraft to land. Not only studying Venus will pursuit other life, but some scientist are looking forward to work with the Venus to undertanst more of the challenge that they will know more about.

The first reason why venus will pursuit despite the danger it present is that venus are also a planet becuase the reader know that it's the second planet that from our sun. It could be a bad idea that '' Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface "". This is way studying are needed to be used with protection at any case that involved danger.

The second most reason important about the challenge of Venus in this planet as an enviornment would crush can be made as "" these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth "". Because of this solar system like Venus impact the hottes surface temperature of the planet. The challenging of Venus consider many researchers into working with the machines that probably would allow them to constribute it's to be knows as knowledge.

Most third reason that will be know is that scientics are more knowable to learn more about Venus than other people because they are more to understand better. More likely, "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation "" just as we know about how it should not be limited, most people woun't know what to do unless they know what will be next in their challenge. It somehow need to be survivable for humans as well into going forward on something that is challenge.

In conclusion, the challenge of Venus is really important to most of the people because venus is like the second planet that need to be look out for and this the reason it dangerous to explore.

10fe8cc,"I think that having driverless cars is the most ignorant things i have ever heard. Since when do we put out lifes on the line just so a machine can drive itself. What is going to happen when a dder runs out in the middle of the road and your little driverless car doesn't vibrate or beep in time for you to react and instead of just hitting the deer, the car makes its own choice to swerve out of the way putting your life in even more danger. I don;t believe that there is a technology that can just make choices and stuff on its own. Why not try this type of expierement with trains first and still have the conductor on board just

in case anything goes wrong.

I will admit, at first it struck my attention but the more I kept reading on and on about how there driver still has to be present during the drive because the car doesn;t know what to do when there is an accident or construction going on up ahead. Yes, there are idiot drivers out in the world today and yes they have caused a lot of accidents butI would rather there be a idiot driver out there compared to a machine that thinks on its own but only has to have a driver present. Think bout this, in the article it stated about putting cameras in the vehicle to keep an eye out on the driver. Well sadly, whether you like it or not nobody will pay full attention in a driverless car, people will get way too comfortable and start texting or jamming out to the radio. For example, people don't even pay full attention nowadays in their own car going down the road in full control.

I think the whole camera idea is the most ignorant part about it. If you are so worried about what the driver is going to be doing and keeping you safe from getting sued, then I suggest that you don't even bother wasting your time and money trying to make this car work. Even if they did have cameras on the inside and outside of the car, what do you think would happen if a little kid or a deer ran out right in front of you and the cars little fancy cameras didn't have time to pick it up and brake. Whos fault would it be? In my opinion, it would be the manufacteres fault because if they tell me oh this car is great, it's a driverless car annd when there's a curve coming up and the car doesn't decide to turn and goes off the road putting my family and I's life in danger. I'd sue the manufacturer for everything they had becuase they lied to me. The choice is yours, buy what you want to buy. All I am saying is to make sure it is what you want and that it will keep you safe!      ",4,2.0,2.0,,":

141c149,"I do not think that there should be driverless cars. Driverless cars still need a driver in them. They also can drive around or know if a road is getting fixed. The cars could also be dangerous. These are reason why i think we should no have driverless cars.

First reason why we should have driverless cars, is because they cars still need to have a driver in them. The car should not be conicered driverless if they still need a driver to take over just in case of an accident ahead. The cars also do not have eyes can not see, how will it work at night. Also during the winter the driverless cars would have a lot of accidents because of snow and ice.

Second reason, is the cars would not know when there is a dead end or the roads are getting fixed. These cars could run off the road if a bridge was not complete. The computer hardware could go down in the middle of driving and people could died. These cars are not humans, and could kill lots of people because of simple mistakes.

My final reason is these cars can be dangerous because how would they know when children are running through the streets. These cars would not be safe around children or eldery people. In the article its says ""If the technology fails and someone was injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufactuer?"". How will the law handle situtations like these, who would be at fault they would not know.

I do not think they should be driverless cars for many reasons. There are also, some good reason why we could have them. A couple reason are they dont use as much gas, they do thing that humans can not do, but these cars can be dangerous to the community. i think that there should not be driverless cars, and cars should say how they are.",4,2.0,2.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 2

1494422,"In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author was suggesting that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers we would have to pass through. The author wrote about the dangers of Venus and how different it is if we could find a way to life there. The author talks about how we could benefit from the information from Venus, that Venus is the closest to Earth in density and size and how we are might eventually need another planet if Earth runs out of recources or an event happens that would result in the Earth dying and we need somewhere to go.

The infromation that we could get form Venus could be never ending, the information that we could get could change everybodys life on Earth or potentially on Venus. We could use the ""insight to be gained on the planet"" to improve our ways of life on Earth and change them for the better. The travels that we take ""on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" in order to improve our society and how we live on Earth and change it for the better we need to have the information to understand how we should change for a new and simular Earth.

We all know that the Earth can't last forever, the Earth lasting forever would be impossible. Even though living on Venus would be hard and uncomfortable the strength of the ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally imntimidating endeavors"" If Earth's recources last longner that most people are expecting there is bound to be wars that would break the Earth down eventually. The Earth needs a backup that is close enough to the Earth that we could still survive the durastic change in atmosphere.

Venus is our worlds closest match the difference in the sizes of the worlds uncanny. It would shock some people how the sizes are closer than any other planet in the solarsystem. Venus is also ""Often reffered to as Earth's 'twin', Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Scientists have been working on a new kind of blimp that can go as high as our jet planes that would just be ""hovering over Venus"" and ""would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way"" This way of living would be hot and cruel to people no used to the pressure of having to live in such a small evironemt but sometimes life isn't good.

15d638e,"If driveless cars are comming in the future I dont know how i will feel about it. Growing up i never seen or even thougth abut driveless cars untill i was a teenager, i just thought about the cars now and days and is these the only cars that we will see in the future. I can't imagine it calling for a taxi if im far away and just getting in a car with no one in there, it would just be wierd, but it will be something that it will just be someting that i have to get used to. When i started to get older i did used to think about driveless cars because i started to see them in television shows and movies, and i also thought how it would change the world forever.

Some part i wouldnt trust it, if you really think about it self driving cars it sounds alittle dangerous. You have to really do alot of things while your driving, you have to use everything in your environment i just think if you made a driveless car you shouldnt have to worry about crashing or even tinking about it. If they did made a driveless car it should be able to drive whenever and wherever and more than just half a million miles without crashing i think you should be able to drive how long as you want.

Then details say that half a million miles without a crash, so does that mean that every half a million miles you are going to crash. I just dont know i think it will look very cool but the only thing that matters is that does it drive well is it really safe its alot of things that can happen. I do like that the detals in the passage say that if you want to take over the wheel you can take over whenever you wanted. Like i was saying you have to really pay attention when your driving from the cuts and turns and also the bad

traffic and then a driveless car, a car doesnt even have a brain it a vehicle not a living thing but one thing i do like is

all of the alerts and sensors that the car have to protect you.

Yes a drivless have good things but also could have some very bad things. Thats just like in a few states like California, Nevada, Florida and Columbia all of those states dont really allow you to use semi-autonomous cars they care about your safety. They just dont think it is safe because you are not driving the car, the car is driving by itself, there many good and bad things about this were just going to see what it is going to be like when it happens. Just like it say in the passage says if someone gets injured whos fault is the driver or the manufacturer.   ",4,2.0,2.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

1686625,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it talks about the positive and negatives aspects of driverless cars. It talks about how driverless cars will be the future cars where no one else as to drive again. It also talks about how even though it is driverless, in some cases like a road accident or in traffic jam drivers are needed to assist the car.

For me I am against the development of driverless cars. First, our technology is not up to date yet. Second, it would likely cause more accidents. Third, not a manufactured things go the way they should. Lastly, it will cause alot of conflicts if the cars muanfuntions.

First, our technology is not up to date yet. If the car is called a driverless car then why do the cars need drivers assistance in many cases. For example in the article it says that driver assistance is need in cases like a traffic jam, car accident, or a road block. I believe the cars should be able to get through with the situations without having to need human driver assistance. The point is that our technology is not up to date that the cars still need driver assistance.

Second, it would likey cause more accidents. I know that salers will try to persuade you with their products, but do all of them work or function properly all the time? No and that is why I beleive that the cars that car diverless will not all function the way it should 100 percent. What can you do if it muanfunctions and you accidentaly kill a person? Nothing really, you can either go to court and try to sort things out or you can take the blame.

Third, not all the manufactures stuff go the way it should. Every product does not function properly all the time. Their may be glitches or maybe some missing information that it needs to function properly.

Lastly, it could cause alot of conflicts. Lets say that you killed a human being while you were in your new driverless car. What can you do? Well first of all you can tell the manufacturing company what happend. What if that dont work? You can try to take it up to court and sort it out. But what if that dont work as well? I guess your gonna have to take the blame for the accident. You see what im trying to get out? It can cause a hazard problem if things go wrong.

In conclusion I am against the development of driverless cars. First, our technology is not up to date. Second, it would likely cause more accidents. Third, not all manufuctured stuff work properly. Lastly, it will cause a huge conflct. I hope you read my eassy and is persuaded that driverless cars are not safe for people and the car industry in general.

18f9457,"Things in life has changed over the years 2018 is a whole new year with many things different then the 1980s for sure. In the past there was no phones or laptops. Now in the present almost everyday something comes out new. There is always a new software here and there. I do not find that a ""Facial Action Coding System"" is valuable for kids in the classroom.

I do not think that it is valuable for kids in the classroom. I do not think that it is valuable because if kids do not understand they will have a confused look on their face. They will also be the ones to ask questions about what they are confused on. Kids have many emotions but I do not think that it will be able to be hard to tell if they are struggling or not.

They said in the passage that it is a painting ""It's the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa."" Also in one of the paragraphs below it says that the human face has to have all 44 muscles in the face to be able to show if they are happy, sad, digusted, etc. In the painting how could there be 44 muscles is the real question. You can not paint 44 muscles in all the right spots when not everyones face is the same shape. Having the same size shape of the face and testing people I can see why they would say that you would be happy or sad. This is a painting and there is probably not a single person with the same face as Mona Lisa.

The ""3-D"" computer model could possibly show all 44 musles in the face but that would be a lot of face scanning because like I said before in my last sentence there could not possibly be someone with the same face shape. How can they test multiple people when those people could have the muscles all over there face. There is simple ones like the ""frontalis pars lateralis muscle"" which is above your eyes and the ""orbicularis oris"" which is around the mouth. that is only 2 out of the 44 muscles that they have to scan on a persons face.

If they wanted to test multiple people that would have to have someone who actually knows where all of the muscles are. In the right stop because if you guess the spots the mood can be wrong. I do not find that it should be used on anyone. Human communication is when two or more people talk together. That is one of the most simplest ways to find out if the kids in your classroom does not understand what you are going over with them. Emotional communication is when someone lets out all of the emotions that they have and will show them becasue they will either be mad with a grumpy face on or they will be upset and not smile at all.

I came up with that it is not valuable for kids in the classrooom because I do not understand why there would have to be a software out when the student could just ask a question in class or even ask after class. There's many other things to do then to have to scan the face and have someone point all of their facial muscles out to find out how they feel. Plus there are multiple kids in the classroom that you would have to scan and not everyone has the same facial structure that would be many times pointing out every single facial muscle and finding out how they feel when there are simpler ways to figure it out.

19676b0,"I present negative aspects of driverless cars becasue they can be dangerous when your driving them. We should't have driverless cars because anything could happen when your driving them. Even though they can drive under specific conditons you always have to be alert.

""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If the car can drive by its self I think it should be able to get threw roadwork by its self. Anything can happen when the driver is not paying attention to the road. The driver can accidently fall asleep or be on the phone and swerve right off the road. People are really fascinated with driverless cars but its not the better chioce when it comes to safety. The car can alert you to late and you wouldn't have a chance to take control fast enough.

However I think you should pay attention to the roads at all times.""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" I don't think thats true becasue anything could happen with the car, with a human i think they have a better response on stopping the car with the brakes. ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. If anything happens to the people i think the maunfacturer

should have full responablity because, why have driverless car anyways.?

""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" I don't think they should sell those and I hope nobody buys them. Because its useless to have a driverless car that you still have to be alert to. If its that good the car should alert it self when at risk of anything. ""Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.""

1a14e33,"Have you ever wondered about how cars would be upgraded ? Just like phones are being upgraded each year, becoming greater that people love it. After reading the article of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", I do not think that upgrading our cars in the future would be nessary for people. The reason why is because it could have a negative impact on us. It can also cause death, change of law , and change of rules the way people are driving.

In paragraph 1, Sergery Brin says that he envisions a future where there would be public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public tranport taxi system. He also says that the car would use half a fuel of todays taxis and would offer more flexibility than a bus.He believes thats such cars would fundamentally change the world. But as for me, I do not believe that it will change the world. People will face consequence, death, and danger if cars like this are invented.

In paragraph 7, it says that cars are designed to notify drivers when the road ahead of us requires human skills, suck as navigating through work zones and around accident. If the car was invented,how would we be able to turn away from accidents and work zone? If something happened while inside the car, we would just be dead.Inventing this car will bring death,

desruption and war to the world.

People do not want desruption,death, and war, they want peace and if this car is invented we will have to face danger.

In paragraph 8, it says that in-car system is actually a safety feature and that safety is a big concern. If the car is invented there won't be any safety. The reason why is if there were no stop light, and signs how are we going to know what the rules are?To change the rule and the law , the goverment would have to change everything that they have worked on for many years.They would have to make new rules and new laws.It will just bring choas to the goverment and to the people.

In conclusion, having a car being invented without a driver would be a bad idea for the future. The reason why is because it could cause death, consequence,change, and desruption to the people and to the world.The cars will not secured us, or give us safety, it will danger us and kill us.We should be happy right now with all the rules and the laws because it keeps us safe from dieing and accidents.People will died twice more than people dieing now.Inventing the car is a bad choice for everyone.

Caring for animals all day on a boyt can be very hard work, but it is alway fun and intergetic work. It is the most exciting adventure you could ever do in your life time, so just try it. When I first heard about the trip it was like th emost amazing thing ever.

Never before in my life had anything seemed so great. The trip wass fantastic, just all the scenery and things you saw. You get to meet and be with other Cowboys. You learn to trust and like to be with animals. It just so I would really advise you to at least try it and see how you like it at sea for so long.

You get pulled in right away whoever you are old or young. There are games such as table-tennis tournaments,fencing, boxing, and the cowboys also play baseball and volleyball in the stalls where there aren't any animals in. You could also read, or wittle to help pass the times when you didn't have anything to do. You aso have a lot of oppertunities to do diferent jobs aound the bout.

When I was on my second round giong along with the Seagiong Cowboys I surved as a night watchman. When you get this job you have to go around every hour and check on the animsls and see if they are all right. While diong this I slipped and fell which was a scarey thing because I wa sheaded strait for the edge of the bout. Lucky me I was caught and only had a brocken rib.

You can also become a very well know person if you do oit right. I am so thankful I went to help, as I said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" I have helped so many international students and and exchange visitors for years. This trip has made my life such a bliss since I agreed to sign up for that trip to take care of the animals while they get shipped across the ocean from place to place and to time.

As I have been telling you just try to and juust see how you like it. When I came oout of high school I was working two part- time jobs and had a best freind named Don Reist. When he came up to me and askekd me if I would do it I couldn't say no. I knew this would be my only chance in a life time. So why don't you try this, or if you don't like it tey something else. Just just do what your heart tells you to do, and be happy.  ",4,2.0,2.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 2

1c71060,"Have you ever thought about what the world would do without automobiles. I have and it isn't pretty. Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Now, chew on that! I mean if you think about all the gas stations, and all the space that automobiles take up, it really wouldn't be a bad idea in banning cars in like citys and small towns. If you were to drive 20 miles in 8 minutes, How fast do you think you would get to that destination if you were to walk that 20 miles. Some situations just isn't fair, Like motorists with even-numbered license plates would have to leave their car at their home, or suffer a 31$ fine. One of the most populated city in the world has gone down to 60% of their population in about five days of intensifying smog. If you were to get rid of all these cars, Who would be getting up every morning just to go to school or even their jobs?

I've thought about alot of things in my life, But never across the fact of get rid of cars. The advantages of limiting automobiles are high, just for the fact of smog problems, or even damaging the air that we breath. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicle in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of idesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.(Duffer,16)

Pow!

You just ran into a car trying to park the long bed V8 4*4 Nissian Titan at gatorbait in Melrose FL. All that money that you payed to get the stupid truck, and now you dented the front bumper. That will be 12,000 for the truck, with another 2,000 to fix the front bumper. How can save money, but also get rid of all this crammed space. I will have to say that we need to get rid of all these cars and just leave them at the house.

I don't know what will happen to automobile shops, but it isn't about the lousy shops! It's about our freedom to do what we please, and if that means that automobiles are in the way, remove them. We, the people, need to make more compact, accessible places where it will be with less space to park. I have an idea, let's forbidden street parking, Driveways, home garages, and generally anything that can be used to park or put a car in. Until that happens it is just a dream, that hundreds would love to become reality. Fellow citizens should also make only 2 places avaliable to park, and that would be parking garages or you have to pay 40$ and buy a house if you break a rule to drive your car to a place.

It just dosen't make sense to keep something that is causing us so much greaf. Did you know that passanger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe,While up to 50% in the U.S is car intensive areas. Life as we know still goes on like nothing has every really bothered us like the Automobiles do. ""Our Development since World War 2 has been centered around the car, now that has go to change."" Said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. They are promoting new communities that would be less dependent on cars. I believe that we finish this car problems, We can focus on more important things such as life, family, and Money.

As I write, People are out in the real world making cars for humans like me and you. If we can't put a stop to having all these new vehicles, than it truly will say something about us and who we are as a community. Yes, I agree with having vehicles to drive from point A to B, But that dosen't mean that I don't want change that will help us with money issues. Automobiles are a waste of space, and can hurt by putting all this money that we're just throwing away like we are the richest country in the World. But, we are not.    ",4,2.0,,,":**

1ca2b1e,"I believe this idea of having self driving cars is not a good idea because, you have to be alert at all times while in this type of car, human skill is going to be needed at times while in these cars and because, its just simpliy a watse of time and money on the manufactuar´s part.

In the story it talks about how self driving cars will change the world and all but, as I see it its all still the same as if you drove the car yourself. In paragraph two it clearly stats that the passanger in self driving cars still has to stay alert at all time just incase complicated traffic issuses are happining. What good does having a self driving car if you have to be alert with it as if you were driving the car yourself.

On top of having to be alert at all times while in these cars. You as a passanger will be needed during complicated traffic issues and roadwork or accidents. I understand that these cars can only do so much as far as tachnology goes but, as I see it they really are not changing anything. In paragraph 7 it tells the reader that self driving cars can function up to speeds at 25 miles per hour but, what about if you are on a highway where cars usually have to go around 40 miles per hour what will the car do then? Its pointless to continue with this research because, the things that the driver would want these self driving cars to do are not able to be done with these cars. Just an example is most human drivers have hard curves and turns while driving self driving cars are not able to do this. This is why its just a waste of time and money.

My last reason why I believe self driving cars are not worth the effort is because of the time and money that is being wasted with these cars. The story clearly states that they have been working with self driving cars since 2009. Its been 7 years in this process of making what is being called a driverless car and to be

honest with you I am not seeing enough pros in this research to want to be on their side on wanting to develople self driving cars. On top of them being in this procees for 7 years I can not imagine the amount of money companies are wasteing with this process. I can promise that test drives for these types of cars are not cheap and in paragraph two is says that they have drivin more than half of a million miles with this self driving car. the only pro to that is that it has all been without accedent.

Who knows maybe in the future they will accomplish making a well developed self driving car but, as I said I do not believe this is a good idea. Much more can be said with the proper imformation but, in the long run companies are just wasteing their time and money in making something that will take years and years to perfect and by then what good will it do. One mistake with the car malfunctioning and all their time work and money will be down the drain.  ",4,2.0,2.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 2

1dd6a58,"How do we know if are feeling are real or not? When something happens to a person that is negitive. That person usall has a hard time getting though it. They try and hid there emotions for the people around them. That is there choice some people are quit and do not like to talk about there feeling and other like to open up and talk. It would be wrong if this system came out and is would show others how people are reallly feeling. Instead of the Facial Action Coding System showing our feeling it would be taking are feeling away in a sense. This Facial Action coding system is showing up everywehere, in classrooms, in the theathed and around the house. People can never hide for there true emotions.

How this works in a classroom. A computer in a classroom can reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored. And his advance technology can change the lesson and make the lesson essaier so the kids can understand it. This is wrong becasue if a kid does not get something they usally raise his or her hadn and asks a question. Kid would not do that becasue the computer is just changing it for them. The kid would lose a lot of people skill. Which are very importan to learn as a kid. Where is the teacher, does this system just replace the teachers all over the world. or do we still have them and the computers just tell them what to teach and what to said. This system could make the kids very self contes too becasue the system is just telling the kids that they do not understand it and that they need the information to be dumbed down for them. This system does not belong in a classroom.

People use this while looking in a mirror because they want to know if looking in a mirror suggest an a emotion. This system says that the musculs in our face know the different between a genunie smaile and a forced one. Why does it matter a smile is a smile. The only people that would be able to tell the differnce are the people that you are really close with. people that do not know you would not even care about your emotions. the system is pointless people have the right to hide there emotions. And if they want to share them witht the people that they are cloase to then good for them. This system should have be used when you look at yourself in a mirror. You personal should know what your emtionsa and feelings are.

People use this on stage actors use it to make more emotion on stage. And again why do we need this. If you are a weel tought actor you should not need a mechain to make emotions or faces for you. The hole point of being an actor is becasue you are good at expressing you feelings. How do the comman people know if the person is a good actor if these meachines are making their faceal expressions. This system is unneed in the arts the actors are capale of making there own faces and emotions.

Why do we need to know the percents of emotions. Do some people really care that much that they need to make it a math . It is very unhealth to make every little thing excat. Not everythiing is perfect nor will it ever be. Our emotions should not become a math proble. becaue the only person that can truly solve it is yourself. Emotions can be all over the place but that is apart of life. And if we had a system to make every little emotion perfect, then how would we learn. How would we know what hurt feels like how would we deal with that hurt. Maybe this system tells you that your 20% happy 50% hurting. It makes your think that is right. Thats how you really feel, computers can not tell you how to feel.

I feel like this system is telling you how to feel. When the people used the video imagery to see what the peainting would look like with a smile. That was okay becasue they were just seeing they were not changing anything perimatal. when you do soemthignfor fun to see what it looks like that is okay. But when you start to make it real. That is what is wrong making our emtions a math problam, telling us how to feel, and what emotions to feel when we are look in the mirror. That is not okay its wrong, you have to let us learn for our emotions in order to change them for the better. If we are sad then find somehting to make us happy. If we want to be alone let us be alone. Let use be human and feel are own emotions. ",4,2.0,2.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 2

1e26ea8,"I am against driverless cars. I feel this way because they will cost to much, there would be loss in jobs in the bmv, and if it cant get around roadblocks then why whould they be a good option.

Firstly the cost of driverless cars would be greater than normal cars now with all of the maitenence and the cost of aquaring the car. If something were to go wrong you would need to go to someone who specilizes in those types of cars. All of the high-tech gadgets in the car would cost way to much to replace. ot only the cost but what about the people who make a living off of making normal cars.

Secondly there are millions of people around the world that rely on making, and maintaning cars that would be put out of enployment because they wouldn't know how to get all of the gear into the car let alone up keeping them. Also people who make a living on making sure people know how to drive a car would be or of a job because no one would be interested in driving the would just let the car do it for them. The cars wouldn't be able to manuver around rodeblocks and accidents so whats the use for a car that doesn't know how to manuver around natural events.

Finaly natural occurences will happen and us as motorisses would need to know how to manuver around them. Imagen you're driving down a country road

at night when all of the sudden boom a deer walks out onto the road; its already

hard enough to avoid a deer when us as people are driving and even then we reduse our speed greatly when it happens so if we were to hit that deer the inpact wouldn't be that dangorous. What would the car do keep going at the same speed? If it does that one dear could kill who knows how many people in the car along with destroying the tech that comes along with it. Another situation would be what if there is a natural disaster like a hurricane and the city or town is evacuating; now lets say that there was a crash along the way and the cars don't know how to get around it, but nether do the people driving because they have relied on the cars to do the driving; no one would be able to escape the city before the hurricane because they had developed a relience on the cars.

These reasons are why I personaly thing that driverless cars should be kept in hollywood and in books because: the cost would be to high, jobs would be lost in manufactoring and upkeeping of the cars, and if the cars couldn't get around an accident or construction what good would it be.",4,2.0,2.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

1e8c487,"Dont you think that having driveless cars will cause many problems? For instance driveless cars would be like schools that dont teach. Teachers would be there but they wouldnt do anything but sit there. Therefore no student would learn. So i dont think that it is a good idea to have driveless cars.

One reason i dont think that there should be driveless cars is because it would cause problems with the manufacture of the car and the owner of the car. I say that because in the passage it states that "" maufactures are aslo considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road."" That is invasion of privacy. Therfore the company and the maufacture of the car can be sued. And im pretty sure that no company would want to gert sued for having cameras on the inside of a car that watched the driver.

Another reason why i feel that there should not be driveless cars is because cars would no longer be fun for people to have. By that i mean most people like to divr they say its fun and it gives the something to do. But if there was driveless cars they wouldnt get to drive. They would just sit in the car and wait untill the car gets to the destination. So how is that fun? It would only be fun if there was a button or a switch that the owner could use to change the cars settings so that when they want to drive they can sand when they dont want to drive they dont have to.

The last reason i dont feel that driveless cars are a good idea is because there is no promises yet that there will ever be a driveless car. For example if a person is looking to buy a car and they go to a car dealership and the person trying to sell them a car says it drives on its own and the person buys the car. When they get to drive it they see that it only drives on its own at certain times. Dont you think that is real misleading? I mean there is no way that a company cant get sued for that. I say that because the company sold a car to someone that was suppose to ""drive by itself"" but it doesnt drive on its own therfore it is misleading and can cause major problems for the company.

And those are only some of the reasons on why i feel that there should not be driveless cars. They will cause to many problems with car companies and the owners of the cars. They will take all of the fun out of being able to drive cars. And if there is no promise that the car will be completly driveless and a company says it is then it could cause companies to loose a lot of money. So for everyone that thinks they should make a car that is driveless dont do it.",4,2.0,2.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 2

20b7318,"During my life i have watched meny presidental elections on my telivision. To me the Electoral College on papper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphes on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not haveing the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not haveing a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presedency but won the populure vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. Anouther piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be presedent then how do we have a presedent that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College chould be a distaster waiting to happen is that rthe votes are tied which may seem not likey at forstn glance but say if the votes are tied the presedency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the desision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barly have a say on who gets to be presedent or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certine party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its posssable for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikey supports what im trying the say in my earlyer Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikey it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that ""we"" vote for the eclectoral College help vote for the presedent insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winner-take-all system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 1/4 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in papper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be.                    ",4,2.0,2.0,,":

very few people want their emotions to be documented on a computer where someone can read them off of. in order for a computer to understand emotions, the emotions and facial expressions for a specific emotion need to be documented. that would make it easy for a hacker to hack into your computer and figure out what emotions you express to certain things. on paragraph 6 the article says,"" imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a simular ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different."" not only will hackers figure out what emoitions you express to certain things, they can also figure out what you like/dislike or what emotions you express when texting someone.

22e1e7a,"Who would want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't you feel bored waiting for your turn to drive. If by chance, you got in an accident, who would you blame? The driver which will be you or the manufacture? I were in your shoes, I would rather drive around myself. I would rather drvier around myself, because I trust myself more than their driverless car. I believe any company should not try to developed driverless car.

First of all, I believe that any company should not try to developed a driverless car because it cause more accident. I believe it will cause more accident because the driverless car they develope is not 100 percent safe. Imagine a 50 cars driving it self in high way. You don't know who they are going to break or stop working. Even tho ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object"" I still would not trust it. Will you be ready when it's vibrate?

Second of all, I believe that any company should not try to developed a driverless car because it can lead to serious trouble. For example, If you get in an accident, who will you blame while driving driverless car? Will you blame yourself or the company. I can tell you this. No one won't want to lose their money. You won't want to lose your money nor the manufacturer. When this happen, someone will fill lawsuit. The company and the people will hate each other.

Another reason I believe that any company should not try to developed a driverless car because anyone won't like a driverless car who need assit. What is the different between you driving the car and you have to be ready when ever the car need assit. I can tell you that many people hate to wait. Also you can trust 100 percent that when the car need your assit. You don't know for sure that it will alert you. It is man mad car. Anything can happen. If I were you I will not trust them because they can lead you to death.

Finally, I believe that any company should not try to developed a driverless car because you can drive as you please. Pretend you are late for something. And you need to get there fast. You need to go faster and driverless car has certain speed. This are the reason I believe manufacturing should not develope a carless car. ",4,2.0,2.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

2343110,"Dear senater ,

I know befor you were senator you voted just like us and you know how frustrating it can be somethings. The Electoral Collage sould be discarted and Presidents of the united states should be elected by popular vote. If we do the popular vote it will be more efficent and be easier to keep track of. We have to do it because The Electoral collage it's failed to elect a President , the masses (the people) don't get to pick the president, and its outdated.

Firstly, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it has failed to elect a President in the past. In the case of a tie in electoral votes it would be the task of the house of representatives the elect a president and the way they elect the presidnt is worse then the electoral collage. even thought and exact tie in the predidental elections has not occored so the catostrify of the house of representatives electing the presisdent has not happen yet ,but it is entirly  possible.

Secondly, we need to abolissh the Electoral collage because the masses (the people) don't get to the president. In the  electoral collage usage of the system resalts in the

People electing the electors ,to elect the president. And in this system the eletors can pull a switcharoo and vote for the other canadent if they so please, to betray the people by doing so. allthought its system has worked scince the founding of our country ,it is still quirky and disfunctionable at times. the electoral collage allows the electors to do as they please if a elector for florida promises to pick one president and gets all the votes to got to the electoral collage he can choose the Other canadent because his freind wanted him to. how stupid is that!

Thirdly, we need to abloish the electoral collage because it is outdated. in our day and time we have smart phones and aindroids that we can use to vote for the president in the peoples choice. there could be a web site that you can go on to submit your election and at the end of the election the compuster can tally us the number of votes to the exact amount so it would be the peoples choice. its  also outdated becouse we dont need one or a few guys to be sent somewhere to cast the vote of the people , we have so mmusch advanced technology that we can have any legal person who wants to vote can and actually have there vote matter insted of what the elector pick so it matters to those few poeple instead of every single person in america.

In conclusion, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it can fail to elect a president(which is almost did in 1960), the masses (the people) can't elect the president(they have to elect the electers to elect the president, and also is is very outdated. in my opion, we should also consiter tweking the electoral callage instead of just getting rid of it.                                                                                                  ",4,2.0,2.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 2

Now a day's people have to take two test too be able to drive. First test is the reluctant permmit test once you pass that you have to get your hours. By hours I mean driving hours at night, morning, on the highway's, streets and etc. The second test we have to take Is the critical drivers test this test is mostly on you,you make your own pressure. There are two people in the car you and the (scorer),she/he dosn't matter who it is they will not jugde on race or sexuality.Once you pass that test your off to the races.

We as people have to go through all that as humans to be able to drive. I get those test make sure we will be responsible on the road so we don't injure yet even kill innocent bystanding pedestrians. All those test to keep them ok and safe I can deal with that so I will be able to drive. In some cases people don't even have a(n) permmit they just drive. There's a catch to that they don't drive stupid or and don't get pulled over.That's breaking the law but if the police don't catch them so be it.

Brains. I know people have those what about robots or A.I. do they have brains? Technically speaking they do have brains called the mother board. That Board/ chip is the harness to their thinking without that they are smart as rocks. What and how many test did they have to take too be able to drive for google, or BMW? I get people have been fasinating over cars that drive themselves. But if the A.I cant pull into drive ways or deal with complicated traffic issues like, roadwork or accidents. I get companies have did remarkable test with great outcomes.

Why do we want cars that drive themselves? The test that G.M did was a graet test and idea. Too exspensive they said how much money did futurist spend to make theese driverless cars.

in conclusion I don't think we need driverless cars. It will take alot more money to build than regular cars. So I say nay.

Located in paragraph one, the positive behind driverless cars is that they use ""half the fuel of today's taxis and off far more flexibilty than a bus."" Sergey Brin believes that these care will fundamentally make a difference in the world. Another amazing fact is that these cars can drive independently drive themselves more than half a million miles without crashing.

Located in paragraph two, line four, it states that these Google cars are not particularly driverless. These cars appear to alert th driver to take over the car when the car is pulling in and out of driveways. They even alert the driver when dealing with complicating issues with traffic. For example, ""navigating through roadwork or accidents."" Car accidents can happen in a split second. It may alert you right away, but this will not give you time to turn away or slam the breaks to keep you from being involved in the wreck. If you happen to be involved in an accident, who is to blame?

Located on paragraph nine, line nine, it states "" new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of the accident. If the technology fails and some is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a huge problem! Most people now will trust that this car will not wreck, however, if they do get involved in an accident they will blame the manufacturers. Like most large businesses will defend themselves and bring them to court.

Finally, what about the teenagers? They go to school and study real hard for their future. The first car they receive is a driverless car. How will this teach young adults to be responsible? How will young adults learn the basics of paying attention to everything on the road and around it? Personally, this whole driverless car invention is sounding a bit lazy and crazy. As a sixteen year old with a drivers permit, I would rather drive on my own then to sit in a driverless car. Driving has helped me to not be completely oblivious in my surroundings. I have learned to pick up some sort of detail in everything. Driving has also helped me with my reflexes. Ina driverless car it doesn't sound too reassuring.

Driverless cars can impact many people in many different ways. This invention can save us fundamentally. This invention could lower the car accidents rate. Nevertheless, we the people can do that on our own. We all just need to pay more attention on the road, and to know when or when not to drive. That is definietly one way to save money. Don't believe me?

Many people just feel like driving instead of walking. If it is a nice day out and the store is a mile away. I do believe people have the ability to walk. Get out and enjoy. Like I have said before, and I will say it again. Driverless cars can impact many people in many different ways. ",4,2.0,,,":**

25a9e8a,"In the Article "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" has a very distinct view on cars. Majority rules that even though these computer cars are more efficient, it can also be endangered for the drivers due to any conditions. These smart cars need more power than just a start button they need sensors. For instance the Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, etc. These smart cars are just too much not just for one person but multiple. These cars may seem fascinating but once you get that bill you'll think other wise . The expenses on the material , technology , and anything else you want will break your pockets. So why even bother when you can have a normal SUV truck that you drive on the regular.

Others may vouch that "" Regurlar Cars "" are basic and dual. They need something that will keep them up to speed. Of course regular cars may cause you more gas, fix broken parts , and more focusing on the road than having the car that can do it itself. But do you really want to waste all your time putting money into a smart car. Thats only going to last for almost a year before you give up. These high technology sensors are nothing new , of course . In 1980, automakers used speed sensors. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger surroundings.

Are these smart cars actually keeping citizens safe? In 2013, BMW announced the development of the ""Traffic Jam Asissitant"". The car can handle driving functions at speed up to 25 mph, But special touch sensors make sure the drivers keeps hold of the wheel. A regular 2009 lexis doesn't need the stability of an assisstant nor these high risk sensors. this car can obtain the same ability of a smart car. So, whats the difference high technology cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Wow!! thats very exciting, even though notifying a driver about upcoming navigations such as work zones, accidents. Human drivers still must remain alert and be ready to take over when situations like that occur. Why investigate into something you cant actually control , but can also harm yourself and others.

These sensors can go out at anytime developing a more dramatic problem upon yourself. By having a regular car you can just go to the gorage an get it fix. Instead of waiting for days to get all the technology back up to running you'll be out on the road an no time. Considering that its more cheaper an less parts to fix. Human aspects on technology is very inconsiderate than rallying on themselves to get the job done.

2837087,"The electoral college is not a good thing and it certainly messes things up it takes votes away from people,  It changes the votes to make a person lose presidency even by changing the senators, and it's a winner take all system these dont turn out good no matter what.  It's even overthrowing the people with the popular vote yes it sadly is possible.

Why would you still have the electoral college if it doesnt help anyone at all?

There are many many ways to win an election and this is not one good way it can easily make one side lose even if they won the popular vote.  The odds of one side winnning is easily changed with electoral votes.  This inturrupts the odds of how much the people likes them then it turns into how much the government of states likes them.  However it could help some people win if they are not the popular vote.

It can also make anyone with the popular vote lose when they should have won like after Al Gore during the gallup poll thanks to the perks of the electoral college won the popular vote but he lost presidency over it. Even though 60% of people prefer the direct election now some prefer the electoral college.

But this can all be due to the fact that the electoral system was made by our founding fathers on the Constitution so it may only be natural that they support it.  A good arguement was when the system allowed for far worse when the electors for defy the will of people like in passage 2 it says ""in 1960 when segragationists in the louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing electors who would appose John F. Kenedy"" that is just evil.  Although the law has not been changed since the Constitution was made.

Even at the most basic level the electoral college is still unfair to voters because of the winner take all system put in place for each state.  They saddly dont visit every state in passage 2 it says ""Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have 0 chance of winning, focusing only on tight races"" Although the winner take all is made just to do what they are using it for by awarding electors to the presidential candidate (exept for Maine and Nebraska) it is being used for what they are using it for.

In all the electoral system is not good but its not all bad it takes the votes away from the people,Its a winner take all system, and its taking people down who deserve to win even changing the senators to make them win.  Its evil and makes no sense to what they are doing trying to give other parties a chance i get it but its gone a little to far.

28d2498,"The limiting of persoanlcar usage has done wonders for the areas that this policy has be implmented. Strictly enviermentaly swpeaking in the cites that have limited their residents persoal car usage the smog rates went drasicly down. Thoughschanges happened in a matter of days. Imagin the changes that could accoure if limited car usage was implmented on a wider scale for the long term. Not only envirermentaly benifical but limited car usage also has large and far reaching econmic and social upsides. The lack of money being waisted on persoanl automobeal transportation leads to a surplus of savings for everyday familes to spend or more nessary items. Socialy limited car usage has be proven to be benifal as a whole also. People living in areas that have  already been placed under this polices report signifigent reducions in stress and worrying, leading to much weight off their sholders and a genaeral better aqttude over all.

The first and most obveous advantage of the limed car usage policiy is the masive positive impact the police has the earth. As stated in source one and I quote ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."". Now imagin if thoes percentages just went away. In the city of Vauban Germany, an expermental city already under the policy, it did. Another example if Paris. A city that literly had to force the policy of limited car usage apon it people in a desperate attempt to reverse what the evils of personal car usgae was doing to the atmosphere of the city. The personal cars created smog so think the city hit record polution levels that even rivaled Beijing its self, one of the worlds most poluted citys. As stated in source two, the city put a ban on cars with any license plates that were even numbered on the first day from driving and a ban on odd numbered the second day. The positives of the limited car usage plicy was so instantanous that the second day of no driving for odd numbered cars ws deamed not nessary. The massive envirmental advantages of the limited car usage policiy can neiter be denyed or ignored.

The economic advantages of this policy can also not be ignored. To fully grasp the economic upswing that will accure under this policy we must turn our attention the the great city of Bogota, Colombia. In this former Spanish colony turned capital city a program has been set up called the ""car-free day"". On this day no cars are driven and a festable is set up to promote alternate transportaion and reduce smog. This year two other Colombian citys, Cali and Valledupar joned the event citing the obouse advantages of the policy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says buisinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza source 3 quotes. The policy as done economic wonders not only for the people but for the city its self. since the day begin in the mid 1990s over 118 miles of bike path have been created, parksand sports centers have bloomed throughout the city, uneven sidke walks have been leveled out, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up as reported by source 3. The limited car usage policy cound be the merical policy for citys in need of an economic boost.

Finaly the social advantages of the policy have also been noted.

The evils of the modern day car culture must be destroyed. As said by Carlos Plaza preveously ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". ""When i had a car I was always tense. Im mush happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter resident of Vauban. Two people on two totaly differnt sides of the world both experenced the social advantages of this policy. Even young people are seeing the advantages according to a study last year that found that driving by young people devreased  23 percent between 2001 and 2009 according to source 4.

As one can now clearly see the advantages of limted personal car usage are impossibkle to deny and even harder to ignore. Economicly,socialy, and enviromentaly this policy as done wonders where ever it has been implimented. It has both immeadit and long term positive effects with no odveous negitive effects. Altrnates to personal cars could be things like Bill fords bisiness plan for a world in which personal vehical ownership is replaced witha partnering with the telecommunications industy to create citys in which pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, and public and commerical traffic are woven into a connected netword. The acceptence of limited car usage and the extenciton of modern day car culture is the next step for the advacment of humanity.            ",4,2.0,,,":** The essay effectively presents a point of view on the issue of limited personal car usage and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

2d1c466,"Boom the sound of ginourmous truck slamming into a house full of people , smoke everywere there's about to be a fire many people are unconcious or dead. More than half of the people in the house are rushed to the hospital. As you can see there has been an atrocious accident because of that vehicle. Their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents , people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution. Also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people.

Obviously we're having a lot of problems with money in this world , if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot. See as it states in source one paragraph two '' A car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars , along with a home.'' With those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world . It aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now. Who needs a car when you can just walk ''stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather than the malls along some distant highway. ''source one paragraph 6.

Pollution is destroying our world and we need to help stop it, so here's an idea lets ban driving due to smog says Paris. Their was an enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Do you agree with that? well I do and here's why . Paris has more smog than other European capitals so if they don't stop the smog it's going to be horrific for their city. Source three paragraph twenty one '' the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.'''Not having cars for one day is brilliant idea because is an improvement to the city of Bogota.

Their is a lot of disruptions an accidents going on because of cars mainly because of the traffic so if their was less cars it would be more peaceful. Usually when there's traffic you hear a lot honking and there's a lot fines for that. The fines are very expensive to pay so you're wasting a lot of money. Also when people are honking they don't realize that other people are sleeping . Everyone needs sleep , some people can't sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam they're awake. Sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that .

So in conclusion what I'm saying is car usage should definitly be limited at least in some countries or states. Money is a really big problem we have that needs to be solved and this is a great way. People living in a surburan area have to pay more just for extra parking places. Air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well. Traffic is not good for the world either because it is stressful an it is not good for people to be stressed.    ",4,2.0,2.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

Whenever they allow driverless cars in most states, its going to create aot of work for the goverment. You have to create new laws, and you would have to qualify for those laws. The best way to keep it is like we have now. We now have cars that may stop and park on their own, and personally that seems to be enough for me. Why would someone want to spend money on a robot car that just drives on its own? The only things thats doing is just making people wanna text while their car is being operated by something they don't even understand. The first reason people will most likely be in danger is the fact that they are going to feel like they don't have to do anything but just sit there. Whenever you have to just watch the rode it can get boring and you might wanna watch a movie on your phone but if you look down you might get a warning to take contol and something happens before you can even look up. Then whose fault will that be? Thats only going to get the car companies sued because the people who bought the cars are gonna be injured and want to blame the car company for warning them too late.

Cars that require drivers are better, they offer more and if you drive somewhere you can go the way you want to unlike the driverless cars, they might take you a longer way than what you want. If you drive by your self YOU can take any short cut that you want. GM has created cars that have seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Some people may get scared easily and a vibrating seat when the car is silent and their mind is on something else can create a panic attack, then what happens? The car and the driver can be at risk all because the seat scared them. I think that if you want to have a driverless car you should just call a taxi so you can sit in the back and have someone else drive for you. If they create driverless taxis that will cause alot of people to lose their job and that will make the crimerate to go up because they might find another job and it's gonna make them angry and wanna take their frustration out on other people.

When someone buys a driverless car they might have to take a class on that to teach them how to work with the cars operating system and thats doing too much. The point that i am gettin at is that if you need a liscense to drive and they come out with these driverless cars that a waste of your learning skills and people shouldn't even have to go through that if they are going to make you get a driverless car thats so pointless because you should have to have rquirements to operate one, and if they don't have any then i am going to stick with my arguement because self driving is more traditional and that's the way it should be.

2ece958,"In the article "" Driveless cars are coming,"" the author presents both positiive and negative aspects of driveless cars. The article is about a smart car that could drive itself. Many of the aspects are unaware and may need human assistance at some time. Even if the cars where fully aware, many states would need an aware, and

focused driver on the wheel at all time. These cars should be made, but only for people who have restrictions on driving such as blindness or

people who are autistic.

Drivless cars are only currently made to be used with help from a human driver. The car would be able to drive itself but the drive would need his hand on the wheel at all times to do sensor in the wheel that could tell when there hands where taken off. ""The car can handle driving functions...but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel"" Another reason the cars are only need help from humans is because they can not drive through workzones and would need help. This would be necessary when roads and bridges are damaged and need repair. This can happen often and would need an alert driver who is able to correctly move the vehicle in a legal way.The car is also able to announce when it needs human help. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill.""

If cars where able laws would still have to be changed. Laws require that there is an alert driver always in a vehicle, in this case it is illegal to test computer driven cars . A few states are leading the nation in the development od self driving cars, these states include California, Navada, Florida, and also the Distric of Columbia.Manufacturers believe as soon as the cares are proven safe, more states will follow. But, there is still on question to be asked if there is an accident due to the failing of technology who would be held responsible. I believe that the manufactorer would be held responsible.There would be reason that it is not there falt, but the falt would mostly be his.

Drivless cars are not copletely drivless yet. They still have hand sesors requiring a driver.There are also stale laws requiring an aware drive at all time. This is why i believe iuf there was to be a copletely drivless car it should not be sold to everyone, but only those who can prove they have have driving issues.              ",4,2.0,2.0,,":**

2f28033,"It's 2020, and manufacturers are fianlly coming up with the technology to create driverless cars. You don't know if you should be for or against this idea. Well, there are many reason why you shouldn't be for the idea of driverless cars. They can be very dangerous, they are probably very expensive, and people would become lazy and inexperienced?

One reason driverless cars are bad are they can be very dangerous. The manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment to make sure the driver doesn't get bored. In doing so, they care creating a distraction. If something happens to the car, nobody will even know because they aren't paying attention. Speaking of, what if it breaks while you are using it, will people know how to fix it? I assume since it will such sophisticated technology that most people will not know how to fix it. Those are just some of the ways we know that this car will be very dangerous.

Another big reason we know this car is not a good idea is that they are probably going to be very expensive. People can barely afford the cars we have now. How can the manufacturers expect to sell a smart car to millions, or even billions, of people. They would not be able to sell enough cars to come out with a profit. On top of it being very expensive to buy, you also have to to look at how expensive it would be to fix it if it broke down. If you can barely afford to buy the car, how can you expect to repair it. Those are just a few reasons on how the car would be very expensive.

Lastly, if everyone could be driven places, would there be a need for riding bikes, or going on runs? People would become obiese. Nobody would stop to smell the roses, or just stare at the beauty of the world that God created for us. Another reason is that kids would never learn how to drive because the car would be driving for them. If the car were to break and stop driving itself, how would they get home because they can't drive it for themselves. Those are jsut a few reasons on how people would become lazy and inexperienced.

317173f,"Driverless Cars are coming soon or later? People have argued that there are positive and negative things about this crazy invention. I see alot of negative things about this invention that is suppose to come into the world by technology. If the car would fail at a point

you could be injured, injured bad or death can occur, people have less experince driving and people will be more lazy then what they already are, and someone could even fall asleep because they arent incontrol of the car the car is incontrol of you and something bad could happen if your in danger and the car doesnt alert you like its suppose to or what if it doesnt?

What if the car fails at letting you know you are in danger and something bad happens is it your fault or the cars fault? If the car fails at telling you this you could be hurt, hurt badly or you could put your life at risk and you could die if your in seroius trouble. You cant depend on nobody or nothing but yourself. I feel like this could put your life at risk. Most people would like to drive the car not the car drive them. Technology could break down at any time you just never know when that time is. It may not work at its best like they say it will, at some point and time it will or could fail

People would have less experince as drivers do today and people would be more lazy. What if your in danger and your incontrol of the car now what if that person has lack of experince and they wont know what to do. They will be in danger and could really hurt themselfs or others. They could crash into another car or crash into smething. This invention is sounding very dangerous not just too me but many others. People are already lazy enough and they would be even more lazy with this invention. Technology is taking control over our world and this would be a big one. Some car accidents are going to happen in the world but i feel like most people are alert and focus already on the road and their surroundings.

If you arent incontrol of the car you could possibly fall asleep at the wheel and what if you need to take over? Then what? Something serious could happen and you could put you and others at risk. Most people want to be incontrol of the car and not have the car be incontrol of them. This invention is very dangerous and i dont feel like it would help our world today. If this invention isnt made i feel it will cause no stress and not alot of worries about the negativities that could happen.

Technology is taking over our lifes very quickly and thats not how it should be. I hope this dangerous invention doesnt come soon or later in our lifes we need to be resposible of being incontrol of the car at all times. This could cause lack of responsibility in many of peoples lifes. This invention is very dangerous. I hope many others see alot of negatives i see in this invention that might happen in the world I would like to see and many other would like to see more people come together and argue that this is dangerous and shouldnt happen in our world.

For most children in school they all have mixed emotions, and what does seeing how happy they are change anything. Children go to school to learn and get education. Some children are happy to be at school, while some are not happy to be at school. And thoes children already show their expressions. When a child is happy and wants to do work at school, they are the ones to always raise their hands and are bubbley. While the children that are not happy to be at school are usually the ones to not sit right, slouch, and do not raise their hands. Most schools say that they want their students to be happy at school, but with all the work that all children have to do and how they are taught to learn, they do not show the same effect on all children. Some children like things to go one way, while the other children like it the other way, so in that case not all children could be happy at school, unless they were to slit things up to make evey child happy and they still learn the things that they need to learn. In the article, it states,"" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's slime. But we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions,""(paragraph 7). If our computers at home can not handle the power that is used to detect one of our emotions, how can so many more computers on one software be able to do that. Schools need to spend money on other things like maybe new floors for the gym, or new lockers, what ever it is there are more important things that need to be done before spending money on a computer that can detect wheather we are happy or not.

A way that the Facial Action Coding System can be used in our schools is to see how every child likes the way they learn. Some children can be so comfused in a clas but they never ask for help because they are too embarresed to raise their hand so they hide behind a computer screen and never get the help they need. And if others can see his expressions and notice he needs help they could help out. There are children who need help but are too scared to raise their hands because then they will stand out, and maybe even made fun of. They hide behide a computer screen so people will not know who is confused or needs help. In the article, it states,"" By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece),""(paragraph 8). This states that it can identify if a child is confused, mad and/or sad about their issuse and their communitcation skills. It can help out the adules on the school help out the children of the school. If they had the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms, it could help a lot of children come out of their shells and maybe even change in a fantastic way.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System is an amazing thing that can identify people's expressions, it does not really need to be in a classroom, but it can definetly come in handy. Maybe just in the libraray but not in every classroom. They can be very helpful for old paints and seeing those expressions. But there are people out there that put on a fake smile everyday to show others that they are not in pain when they actually are. A lot of people put on an ""act"" for others, meaning that they smile and looks so happy to others, while actually they are hurting and are in pain on the inside. Most people would not notice because they only see what other only show.

34e37d0,"In my opinion, I'm against driveless car and I believe that it is not safe for us. Driverless car still have a long way to go; none of the driveless car that are invented today are ready to be tested in the real world. We have car that we used in today world and theres no problem with it. There are no reason why we need Driveless car.

First, how can we trust driveless car or the company creating these car? They are so useless and we dont need it. I know it sound cool ""self driving car"" but, how can we trust these companies makeing these car. Most of the comany that sell car are money maker. According to the ""Drivelss Cars are Comming"" in paragraph nine the author stated ""If the techonology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" What if you are invloved in accident and none of it was your fault, and they chager you for it.

Futhermore, We should all be concered about this, and my big concered is how much these Driveless car cost? What if it cost like million of dollar to own these car. Then it would be useless and a wastefull of money. In the text it also stated that the car can only handle 25 mph, and the human have to keep hold of the wheel. What the point of riding the driveless car, if you have to keep hold of the wheel. In the rest of paragraph 7 it talks about the human must stay alert and be ready to over take any danger situation. Coumpter car are not really safe there could be a smart hacker and takes contorol of your car. How will we react to a hacker and who would be responblie for it if we got invovel in a carsh?

On the other hand, Most of the company like Mercedes-Benz, audi, and Nissan plan to have car that can drive by themselves by 2020. As times goes on coumpter will drive our own car and ruled over us. We have to be aweard of what is happening. Most of us are not even sure what self driving car exactly is and never been on self drving car before. For me, I think I dont need self driving car I got my own hand and I can drive my self as safe as I wanted to be.

In conclusion, I hope in the near future there will be no consequencey with self driving car. Years 2020, is not a long way before you know it everyone could ride selfdriving car. Coumpter will contorol the car and we put our saftey in their hand. We will have to turst the coumpter that it is safe to ride the self driving coumpter car. ",4,2.0,2.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

35ba672,"We humans have made some fantastic things over the years, but driver less cars was a bad idea because things maulfunction, there's no one to blame in case of accedent, and we will become dependent on them.

To begin with, our technoligy has malfuntioned a few or more times, so how can we be so sure that driverless cars are a good idea?

The main question is what will we do then?

We should just stick with the old fashion way hands and wheels. Machienery can be risky at times because there so unpredictable they can be working just fine then all the suden BOOM car crash, and some people can't afford insurance. How will the company pay for all the car crashes, they wont.

Another reason we should not put these death machiens on the market is because who are we going to blame for all the accedents and car crashes that are going to happen? So many problems are going to be faced when some one is trying to get money from a crash or some one is injerd. How will this be ruled out and can we trust our selfes and the next generation with this vehicle? Agien these vehicles should not hit the market because they will hit people.

In the article it states that ""the car is in autopilot 90% of the time"" what about the other ten percent of the time.

Although there are many things bad about this car there have been SOME good things about it the article states ""the car seat shakes when the passenger is in danger"" so thats good. Some people think that the car is a gift from god and from really any stand point this car will change the world (or the U.S.).

Last but not least, we should not have these cars because we will be dependent on them. These cars are going to be like phones first unreliable then they get better then they take over the world. A bunch of people will have their seats all the way back lounging not even caring at all.

As we can see these will become a problem for the next generation mabey the car reck rate will go up maby it wont. People wont even have to see where there going just put directions in the gps and sleep.

These machines should not be trusted. People who are making these STOP!

389c7bf,"I would argue yes this could be a valueable. The reason this could be valueable is because this can be used anyhwhere in classrooms work offices police office etc. People wouldn't be able to lie about what they done or how they feel inside. This could become a lie test for people who comit crimes.

I believe this new technology could become a great tool. The teachers when they ask a student if he/she understand their face tell it all. This can also help teacher who at times don't know how a student feels and relate with the student. If the students aren't into a lesson the teacher know so she maybe come in at a different point of veiw. This would not only be a good tool but it could make people better at their jobs.

This new technology can be use in the court. When people lie they put on a different face with the kind of tool the courts can detect if someone telling a lie. This new technology tool can make jobs like easier and take stress off people knowing that they did the right thing. This can also tell if someone gets mad and about to lose control which can also be a sign of guilt.

This new technology tool can be of great use in the at docter office or the emergancy room. This tool can help se how much pain a person is really in and what they can do to help. This can also see if someone is liying about pain to get pills to sale. This can also see if someone needs help mentally and what can help or be of great use to them. This new technology can help after a women has given brith to see if the baby is doing well.

I think this new technology tool can be of great use to our society. This technology open doors to a better life a better school for kids. This technology can be useful because it helps people see the things wrong about them. This technology can be used anywhere helps peole who needs help this can also help people descirbe how they feel in the inside.

390be02,"My position on driverless cars that there is a cause and effect to it. You can have postive effects and some bad effects such as having someone drunk in the car and they do something reckless in the car. But a good effect is that you can have someone avertise the car or use it in a good way. You have good reason that you can be having long dinstance driving and might take a nap if you get tired. then wake up and take control of the car. You might have the car for it's breaking system and not know that car that close to you and it can save someone life. But there somone bad effects like somone with out there driver liscense might get a smart car and get pulled over with them in it or have some thing bad happen to them.

Then you got the waitng on the law there might be some states that might not like the smart car and have people getting hurt and having it be the people that created the car problem. Such as california,Nevada,Florida,and the District of Columbia. they belive that you need somone with a licesnse to be driving the car so they baned it. They belive it be more reliably and safe. Who falult could it be the driver or the manufactur. But automakers still making there work and plan to have them ready by 2020.

Then you got senseing the world like travling long places in a smart car or having them racing. There alot of radio recivers and satilete information it has to be for the car to work right. You gonna need some type connection in the area at all times so the car don't do anything wrong. Then you got many car manfuctors trying to work on there own types of cars to make there's better. Then they got sensors for the cars for speed sense to know how fast you are suppose to go. Then for the breaks so you dont have out of control skids down the road.

Last thing is you have advertisement for the cars in movies and on tv. Trying to get people to drive them and persuade them to get it and not make it a money issue. Make it easier for public transportation and taxi-system. Then try to make it a better way to get around in all of the coutires and states.

Like tomorrow this can't be stoped people are going to make cars that can drive them selves.

But cars that drive them selves would be a tariable thing for this world.

Driverless cars would not be good because a computer can not react like a human can, we would loose jobs and this would effect the economy, and because they limmit the freedom of the passanger.

Driverless cars would not be a good thing because a computer does not react like a human.

Humans naturaly have a reflex that a computer doesn't, we see something run into the road and we know weather to slam on the breaks (in the case of a child) or run over it in hope you don't hit it (in the case of a squwarl).

A computer could mistake these suck objects and thus causing another problem of is it ""the driver or the manufacturer"" (10).

Also in the case where the car would control the speed of the car.

Say you were driving a woman to the hospidle because se is going into labor, or someone needs medical attenshion and you need to drive them there.

In cases such as these going the speed limit is not the best thing.

You would need to go over in order to save or help the person.

For reasones like this a computer as a driver would not be a good idea.

In the state of Indiana the manufacturing of car is one of the economical exports that we have.

If you were to take all those jobs and take them out to California to build driverless cars, that would hurt the economy of Indiada.

Also what about other formes of trancportation that require a driver?

The taxies of New York, or the local buses that run all over the country? what would happen to bus drivers jobs, would they all be replaced with driverless cars? For that reason of hurting the economy driverless cars would not benifit America.

Driverless cars also would restrict the freedoms of the individuwal.

Say you were of a drive and you wanted to go throught backroads to see the landscape, would the driverless car take you there or would it take you on the main highways? In these driverless cars how would the passanger be incontrol at all? Technology may be atvancing in many ways than one but I don't want the way I travel to be restricted.

Driverless cars would be horiable because computers can't react like a human can, we would loose jobs and it would effect the economy, and because they limmit the freedom of the passanger.

For all these reasons we should not have driverless cars.

Pluse haven't we seen enought movies where there are driverless cars and robots walking the streets that take over the world?

Variouse movies have been created like these and every day we come closer to robots taking over the world. I don't want that and I think we should provail it as much as possiable starting with the driverless cars.  ",4,2.0,2.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 2

3d0abd2,"To promote, I would like to start off by saying I am one who is all for new technology because it is the 21st century after all. Technonlogy has become an everyday thing such as the iphone or even somehting as advanced such as CGI movie technology. These are great attributes that will help us learn and will help our future to further develope the technology we have discovered but for something as a Driverless car might be a little to dangerous for us just yet.

In addition to my previoues paragraph, I will enlist you on the negative outcomes of why Driverless cars. To begin the name "" Driverless Car"" is a false adverstisement because these so called cars aren't even 100% driverless. In order for these cars to work they still ahve to operated by a human being at somepoint why the car is active. In most scenarios the car can accelerate, brake, and even park itself without human interactions. For other situtaions such as construction blockinh you near by exit or a terrible wreck on your way home from the work,

the cars sensors will not be able to manuerver around the problems that lie ahead so you must then take the job at the captain's seat and control the vehicle yourself. Already we haven't even spoke about the danger of these Driverless cars and we are given many reasons to disagree with it's exsisitance.

Carrying on, cars such as the Toyota Prius have been Driverless cars for quite some time but not everyone wants to drive a Prius becaus may not suit their liking or needs. Therefore with this being said this is another negative outcome for those of us who want the newtest brightest technology and are disappointed because they don't simply make the technonlogy fit our needs. Also included in the Prius is tons of technology such as senors for parking and close bumper action, a rotating sensor on the roof, a GPS, and a rearview mirror camera. This car comes with many surprises and features that suit the tiny geeks in all of us needs. Even though this car seem very safe with sensors and cameras mounted at every nook and cranny, what if we were to get into an accident and the physical features of the car were repaired but not the technological features. What would we do if we had relied on our sensors to help us brake and instead of the car breaking it were to roll back and hit someone else vehicle? Also maybe the car could have a malfunction and accelerate instead brake causing an accident. Who is to blame now, th ecompany who made such a safe 21st car or the driver who wanted to be with the new times and have the the greatest piece of technology out there on the road?

With more to say, what are we do about the pricing of these Driverless cars? Sure they may be twenty two thousand dollars and that may be a deal with some of the customers that purchase them but what about the technology underneath the hood. Such as the radar which was a hilltop program just being discovered and was a very advanced program when first sought out by Sebastin Thrun. He was the founder of the google project and used radar in many of his cars. What if we were to somehow damage the radard and a customer used this radar everyday because they were a business man or woman who travled day. What would they do if this two hundred million dollar piece of technology broke. Of course it's just the program that cost that mcuh but would the company fix it or leave it to their custmor considering it's their car or ""problem"" now?

In conclusion, to my rebutal of the posititve outocmes of Driverless cars I speak about how if we were to even think of purchasing one of these vehicles would it's phycial appearance even suit us? Howevee if that doesn't change our mind about not buying one then maybe the type of protectioe it offers will because no ones wants to be hurt by something they absoulutly adore. With that being said we would most defintely not purchase such an item espeacially if the car didn't offer full coverage on it technological material because paying for an expensive car is enough, why woudl we pay for the technology they made to be fixed again because of their faulty work.

3d100f8,"The future holds many great things but one thing that isn't on that list would be driveerless cars. Just thinking about it brings danger, with people inside a car without a real driver can cause many accidents. In the future I feel like our death population will really rise up because of self driven cars. How are they going to know when to turn or what to do in a bad situation. Driverless cars is going to be a very nad idea.

Why do we need driverless cars there is absolutely no point in it. Just so people dont have to drive and they can be lazy. Or because just in case if someone is tired and can't drive much longer. Well would you rather drive your self than a robot car that for sure has no idea what other people can do. Because when people drive and someone is next to them they can tell when they are shifting over but a driverless car can't because all it can do is tell whats behind and in front of it not to the sides. With this idea I am definitly not for it becasue I will rather walk it is just to dangerous and I do not want to take the chance. If they give me an oppurtunity to drive a driverless car and a self controlled one I would rather go with a self controlled one. Now by the time the driverless car is invented I moght be dead. But I would rather be dead from something else than a driverless car.

America has had many deaths and a lot of that is because of cancer, car wrecks, and other sickness and if the driverless car is invented I feel like it would turn into the top ten death causes. No will understand how many causes we will have with them. And im not just looking out for the people bt also google. Google will be a lot of debt off because people will be sueing them all the time. Before they make this a final decision they might want to look into the future because of all the teens also. Teens will play a big role into that and that could cause a lot of damage.

Who ever made this idea is a smart person I will give them credit in inventing something that can drive itself around, but I will also give them credit when it's there car that has caused the most deaths in the world. Plus what if someone tells them to go somewhere and they fell asleep and didn't notice the robot went the wrong way and the person would end on the complete opposite side of a town or even a country. You never know how smart the car can be. And if it was up to me I would not be one of those people who would buy a driverless car.                    ",4,2.0,2.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 2

44b5fc5,"How much money do you think you would you save from gas if you didn't use your car? In Germany people do not use cars, they have given them up. In Vauban's streets they infulenced people to not drive their cars or own a car so they would not pay have to pay $40,000 for a garage to store in their car, including a home. Over all Vauban's streets are car free, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own a car and 50 percent sold a car to move there. When a place becomes car free it leaves more space for walking and less space for parking.

Paris enforced to ban driving to clear the air of the global city. Drivers would have to leave their cars at home if they had odd or even numbered license plates or pay a 22-euro fine. Car traffic decreased to 60 percent in the capital of France after five- days of intensifying smog. Exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybirds, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transportation was free from Friday to Monday. Paris has more smog than other European capitals. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

Car-free day is a program in Bogota, Colombia;it began in the mid-1990s. The program is meaning to spread to other countries and the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Colomians did a varitey or activities as a use of transportation; hiking, biking, skating, taking buses, taxis to work on car-free day. Streets were more clear. When Colombians drove cars on this day they would pay a $25 fine. Two cities from Colombia, Cali and Valledupar joined this event, people would still participate dispite the weather condition they were in. Changes were occuring, parks and sports centers were blooming in the city, uneven sidewalks were replaced by smooth sidewalks, new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

President Obama's goals were to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies say that Americans are buying and driving less cars and licenses are decreasing as each year goes by. The rise of cellphones and car-polling apps has faciliated and more commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. New York's biking program bridges and tunnel tolls reflect new priorites as of car-sharing programs accross the nation. People have used other kinds of transportation instead of using their own. Mr. Sivak's son lives in San Fransico and owns a car but uses Bay Area Rapid Transit. A study has shown that fewer people have found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001-2009.

You waste money on gas for your car. There is another way of transportation you could take to arrive to your destination to save money. You could go car polling with a friend or take the communities cheap transportation. Using a bike is also a simple transportation and walking...most people are capable of walking. When cars use gas it eventually spreads in the air that we breath. The only way to decrease the polluted air is to limit car usage. Countries are helping in a way, by encouraging them to participate in a program (car-free day) and banning cars.    ",4,2.5,,,":**

4993cfc,"Driverless cars should not be used on the road yet, or anytime soon. Driverless cars are way to damngerous, and could take up a lot of money. The main thing most people would be worried about is the fact there not really in control of what goes on with the vehicle they purchased. There could be many costly bills, many law suits, for something you didn't do, but what your driverless vehicle did. This could lead to too much then we neen when we could all do what the vehicle is made for, which is for us to drive not to drive by itself.

Even though many people have already started investing in the idea for driverless cars, they could be putting themselves in a bigger hole then they thought. The money there putting up could go to waste cause more then likely people would want to drive there own car. This meaning there investing in something that nobody would probleby not want. The big name companies such as Toyata, and Chevy could lose alot of money, when they was making more doing it the normal way. If your in the car driving what you bought you would feel better about your car.

The driverless cars could come with maufunctions that could lead to law suits. Things like your brakes, your steering wheel and even wheels could mess up and you're not there to see who did it or not, cause the car is driverless. Such as if someone was to his your car and the car was messed up, how would you know who did it. Little things like that could change someones whole perspective on the vehicle. Which could make the people take back the car and get a normal one, which means the big name companies would lose money.

Not only would we have to wait to even get the car, you would have to be careful with the laws too. Laws such as keeping people focused on the road. Such as if someone hit the car your not driving who would be respansible. If no one was there in either of the cars no one would win the law suit. Many states its already illegal such as California, Nevada, Florida, and Columbia. Once other states realize the damages, they'll change there minds too, and make new laws for cars, Which will make them fustrated and ban cars from many places. In that case if that happens the big name companies will lose a lot of customers and long time assumers, then eventually lose all there money they invested.

This could lead to too much then we neen when we could all do what the vehicle is made for, which is for us to drive not to drive itself. The driverless vehicle is not safe enough to be on streets yet. Nobody would know who's responsible for the mistake of a (driverless car) nondriver. There will be lots of laws banning them and running car buissness down the drain. There would be many things wrong with the routes, such as if there was a car acctident, and the car had to reroute it couldn't.

4a6a1db,"Is Venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers of studying it ? Well in the text it is stated the ¨Venus is the second planet from our sun¨ and mostly it is referred as the Earth´s twin. So the author claim´s that it is a challenge to meet and presente by Venus having value, but the travel on earth should not be limtied by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the imagination and innocation.

So the author talks about how it is the closest planet to Earth in the terms of the size and density and of course the closest in the distance too they are like planetary neighbor. There are differnce because somethings it changes we are closer to Mars and sometime we are closer to Venus. There have been previous mission that was unmanned, but they were for good reasons. According to the text ¨snice no spacaft survived the landing for more than a few hours, and numerous factors contribute to Venus´s reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity for us.¨ so the author tells us why there have been many fails and why they are still studing for it.

The another thing is that how Venus is a thick atomsphere that is cloely by 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. That it is more hard for the clouds to have highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atomsphere. According to the author ¨ on the planet´s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet.¨ So this is more far extreme than something else humans encounter on here this earth so trying to move up there is going to be a little hard and diffult.

Last thing to support the idea of studing Venus is long time ago they said maybe there was ¨probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth today.¨

Also now that NASA has one idea that sending humans to study Venus though they said it will be challenging because of the temperature will be toasty that will be around 170 degress Fahrenheit. Also the pressure of the air would be closer to the sea level on Earth. They will use solar power and radiation that will not exceed Earth levels, but that will be survivable for humans. Also with many of there new teconology and new modern computers that are powerful, flexible, and quick, but becomes more delicate when it comes to extreme phyical conditions.

Overall the author made many supports and the idea of studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

4afb85e,"I am Luke Bomberger, and i go on sea cowboy trips. There are many things to see and tour. There are many reasons why some one should become a sea cowboy. I hope you listen to my advice.

One reason someone should becoome a sea cowboy is because you get to do a lot of sightseeing. I got to go to China, Greece, Venice, and Crete. In China, there was great sightseeing. So many things to tour and look at, and i got to see the Panama Canal while heading there. It was beautiful.

I aslo got to go to Greece, as i have already told you, and got to see the Acropolis. Greece was by far the best place i went. It is one of the spectaclals of being a sea cowboy. If you aren't a sea cowboy then its likely that you will never see the things i got to see.

In Venice, the streets where made of water, or atleast people traveled by canals of water. The people of Venice had to be good at controling boats to do that because i tried, and fell in the water. You get to do some unique things as a sea cowboy, such as the things i just described to you.

Crete was the second best, because i got to see the Panama Canal. I couldn't say enough that it was beautiful. With its wide mouth and trees every where, you don't see that every day unless you're a sea cowboy.

There may be a big wait to get to those places, but its worth the wait. Hey, that reminds me of the time i almost died at sea. If you like risks, you'll love being a sea cowboy. Back to the time i almost died at sea. I was walking on deck, just back from checking the animals, and i sliped on a ladder below me. I started sildeing down the side of the boat, and caught on a peice of metal. That peice of metal saved my life. I did end up with a few broken ribs, but i was ok.

Did i mention the animals, almost 400 hundred animals each trip. The best part of it is being with the animals. I get to feed them, clean them, and water them. Some of the animals you get to see are some of the ones that might start to feel connected to. I got to keep a horse that i loved. Another great thing about being a sea cowboy.

4c28b83,"Every day people wake up, get ready, and go to work or school. The way they get there can vary but for the most part, people drive cars. That's about to change. Helping the enviroment and becoming more relaxed are advanatages for limiting car usage.

By reducing car usage, emmitions produced from automobiles can be reduced and help the enviroment. When cars reslease gas into the air, it causes smog which traps the gases and inhibits them from being able to escape the atomosphere. In largely congested cities smog can be as harmful as 147 micrograms of particulate matter as seen in Paris, France (paragraph 17). Paris enfored a partial driving ban due the amount of smog and just after one day of reduced driving, the smog clears enough so they didn't have to enforce the ban another day (paragraph 19). Passenger cars are resonsible for 12 percent of greeenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United States. (paragraph 5). This staggering statistic can open your eyes to how much cars really effect the envrioment. If just once a week you didn't use your car, you could reduce greenhouse gases drastically. In the United States today, recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, and are driving less. (paragraph 29). Since 1995, the number of miles driven per person dropped almost 9 percent (paragraph 32). With lesser people buying and driving new cars, gas emissions could change drastically within a few years and could help our evrioment exonentialy.

When you do not drive a car to from places every day, you become a more relaxed person. In Vauban, Germany- residents have given up cars almost all together, only 30 percent of residents owning cars. In this Suburban town, it seems comman for mothers to own a minivan to ship children back and forth all throughout town; Heidrun Walter feels other wise. She has given up her automobile to get around town and ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter states. (paragraph 3). For the past three years in Bogota, Colombia they take a day out of the year where only taxis and buses are permitted, the Day Without Cars. Even when dark clouds circled around the city and rain splattered down onto the heads of people, they didn't revert back to their cars. A businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (paragraph 24). This day has become so popular, two other cities in Columbia joined in as well the celebrate the day where people do not use their cars. People do not need to meet with other people in order to go to work or hangout with friends anymore; they can be in their own homes using the technology they access see their friends and continue to do their work.(paragraph 35). Without having to commute to an office, people feel less stressed and more relaxed being able to do their work in the comfort of their own home.

People used to accossicate cars as the best way to get from place A to B without thinking about the consequences it can have on the planet or on yourself. You have to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. What can you do to help change the world?

016010c,"Driverless Cars

Driverless cars are coming in the future. In the future, no one will probably need to buy cars because they won't need them. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, that will happen. He sees a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public- transport taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. There are many great things about driveless cars, but there are some bad things as well.

Driverless cars are really beneficial. Driverless cars have way more senors and alerts than regular cars. For example, if the car is about to back up into an object, the driver's seats will vibrate to let you know. Also, within the past 10 years, sensors on the driverless cars have become way more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Driverless cars are also very safe to use. The cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mile per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Even though the word ""driverless"" may scare you, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. Which means you are still somewhat in control of the car. The cars may be able to steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when the time comes. The car can quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Basically, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. (Paragraph 7)

Driverless cars are going to become the next big thing. They won't just become beneficial to you, but everyone else as well. The cars would only use half the fuel that today's taxi use. Which is a huge deal because we as a whole, we use a lot of fuel. Also, it will offer more flexibility than a bus. Just imagine that. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes these such cars would fundamentally change the world, and everyone else should believe that too. (Paragraph 1)

Some people may agrue that letting a car be in control is just absurb. You never know what the car might do. It could end up causing you to end up in a wreck, or maybe it won't slow down and the brakes won't work. Even though you are alert, what can you do if something goes wrong? Nothing. If the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is not a whole lot you can do to stop it. You just never know with a driverless car. You are putting yourself ar risk while you are in the car because you are not 100% in control of the car and that is not safe.

In conclusion, driverless cars are very safe and have major benefits. Some people may be scared of letting a car be in a control, instead of them being in control of the car. But no one should have nothing to worry about. As long as you stay alert, you should be fine. Even though the car can do many things by itself, it still sends you heads up when it needs your assistance. Driverless cars coming very soon in the near future.

01c5e87,"No, i do not agree with America creating ""driverless"" cars . Depending on a machine to navigate the roads and sucessfully take you to your destination is an accident waiting to happen litterally. Who would be at fault if a wreck were to accure? Would you really be able to have piece of mind while letting your car do the driving?

First, you have to think about who would really be at fault if an accident happened. In the article it states that ""if technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" Well it would be challenging to understand that fully, because if something were to happen with one or more sensors malfunctioning, than how can you blame the driver in that case? The maufaturing companies would have to run numerous tests and double check to insure that all of the sensors and gadgets on the vehicle are in working order and stay that way so they deliver a safe product on their part. At the time of the wreck, you will have to take into concideration what each driver was doing, and the steps leading up to the event to come to a conclution of who fault it is.

Secondly, the cars arent 100% driverless, you still have to take over the wheel when need be. When in these cars, the driver has to give his/her full attention at all times, so you might as well be in an ordinary vehicle. A quote from the text states ""their cars have driven more than a million miles without a crash but sofar, Google's cars arent trully driverless; they alert the drivers to take over the when pulling in and out of drive ways or dealing with complicated issues, such as navagating through road work or accidents."" Having to take over when their is a contruction zone or driveways etc, is not the deffinition of a full driverless car to me.

lastly, the cars have fancy sensors and other tools and whatnot , but these cars still call for human skills. Driverless cars are intelligent but may not be able manage a situation if you were to look down at your phone quickly or something else along the lines of that. The information states that ""they can steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. You have to stay focused on the road and guide the car if needed in a situation. if you want to not stay locked on the road and do another thing while in the car, these vehicles are not for you.

In conclusion, i do not approve of these inventions until it is proved that they are 100% safe and until you dont have to pay attention to driving the whole time. Driverless cars still need the skill of a human behind the wheel, they arent fully driverless and something may not work in proper order, and also you have to think about who would be at fault if a wreck happened. These are all things we need to take into concideration before going out and purchasing one of these new vehicles.

01dabde,"Work. School. Party. No matter what you have on your to do list you still have to get there, so why are car sales going down and how is it benificial to our society? Teens and young adults can often be heard discussing what brand of car they one day hope to buy and all the modifications they will make to 'trick it out'. Many people though end up being 20 or older before they actually get that car they always talked about, and despite parents claim of laziness there could be more to it then that. So what advantages could there be to a  world with fewer cars on the road?

The first topic that is at the forfront of the minds of most people just starting out their new life is cost. The world revolves around money, thats just the way it is, so many people are finding themselves cutting out things that they don't really need. Now I know what your thinking but before you begin your argument that you really need that blue mercedes you saw in the magazine think about just how much that cost compared to your last paycheck, not so exiting anymore right? With public transportation becomingh more and more avalible many people are choosing to take the public bus rather then buy their own car. Another thought is all those taxes you pay. What you thought they went to police and teacher's wages and building nice little parks for the kiddies? Well acording the Environmantal Protection Agency 80% goes into making Highways and other transport, and why do they need that much money? Because we drive 100 tons over them every day. Many of the more polluted citys are even begining to put laws into place banning or restricting traffic in some areas and placing fines on those who violate them. Between the purchase price and matnence as well as gas and the money used to fund roads and highways theres a lot of dough pouring into your car drives.

Now heres the topic I know your all tired of hearing about but its still very important, the environment. Car emmisions are the second biggest source of polllution in the atmosphere, first place going to powerplants and third place being cows, yes cows. Is a world blanketed in smog and smoke where the very air that sustains you is poison the kind of place you want to live in or, for that matter, raise kids in? Its not the the planets health we're talking about here its the health of everything living on it including us. While we're on the topic of health one of the greatest health issues in America is obesity, now imagine if everyone left their cars at home and walked or biked instead, the whole country would be healthier then ever before. And you know how when you go into the country the air smells so nice and clean, well that could be the city too if we just cut back on emmisions, we could have nice fresh air as well. Now think of your children, or friends or even yourself, just outside playing football when a car comes by and almost hits you, dozens of people die every day in car crashes that wouldnt if there were less cars on the road. So think of the health of your familly, your friends, your pets, and yourself.

Finally we have the cultural shift, many Americans are already choosing to carpool take public transport or even just walk and less and less are buying cars. This trend is so noticibly prominent that car companys are trying to come up with new ideas and products to keep their customers coming. Citys are coming up with new systems of bike and car borrowing as well as a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and imporve safty"". So for those of you that can't stand to be left behind by the times jump on the band wagon and you can do your part to bring about a new cleaner era in the world.

Cars, the parasprites of a modern age, keep multiplying and destroying more and more. The emmisions given of by these monstrosities will linger more many a milenia poisoning the air we breath and devastating the world out children will inherit. Unless we do something to stop it now this travesty will continue to ravange all life on the planet untill we are on the brink of extinction, so do us all a favor and help to push this new trend of a car free world.

01f5682,"Dear State Senate,

I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don't care about voting for the next United States prsident because they don't get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.

In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that particular state. There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country.

Source two talks about the electoral college and how the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. In paragraph nine,  the text says, ""... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters  would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

Paragrapgh twenty-three, ""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state- Democrates in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don't even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won't do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn't care less.

We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.                             ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

022a010,"I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be slightly helpful, but other than that, not at all. While few would benefit from being taught by a computer, others, not so much.

Dr. Huang said that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I believe this is wrong, as there is no way of making a student less bored. If you were to add entertainment to the mix of the lesson, then how could the lesson be taken seriously? Teachers tend to add their own spice to lessons that, both, make the students laugh, and become more interested in the lesson. No computer could mimick a human's humor. A computer also would not be able to explain things as well as a teacher could. A computer could modify the lesson as many times as it could, but the student would still be confused. A teacher would be able to explain things better and make it simpler than a computer could. It would also be quicker.

It is proven that students learn better with paper and a physical learning environment. Sure, a computer would know more and be able to explain things more properly, but knowing this fact... Would it even be worth teaching the student if they won't even remember it? Technology would also completely replace the need to write down notes by hand. With a physical environment, you also learn life skills. For example, knowing when to speak and ask questions, manners, and getting along and working with others. These skills are often used in work environments.

And, what about those who have no access to technology? Poverty and homelessness are still big in the world. Sure, your child could participate in a physical environment at a school, but why would there be a need for schools if it is all on the computer? It would also be cheaper for school officials to have computers than to have teachers that require a weekly or monthly pay, and to not require supplies for the children as well. It would quickly spiral into a ""be rich or be homeless"" world in an instant. A lot of stress would be put on the backs of many people who wish for their child to get an education. We already give these people a hard time, why given them an even harder time, and even include their children?

In conclusion, a lot would be wrong with using the Facial Action Coding System in schools. Very few would benefit from having such advanced technology instead of teachers and a physical environment, but the rest would be disadvantaged.",5,3.0,3.0,,":

02ab5d2,"One car, one life, one big accident. That is all the future is asking to develope by continuing to try to improve and inspire people to use ""driverless cars"". I do not think driverless cars should ever become a new big thing for many reasons. They can malfunction on you. They still need assestence if they cant handle a road situation. They might not update any new laws or road changes nearby. There is so many negative reasons and thoughts that appear when thinking about the development of driverless cars.

My first reason to why I am against driverless cars is because they can always malfunction. What if it doesnt see an animal in the road and runs it over will it stop to help, would it starting loosing control? Who knows because your not the one behind the wheel. You could have stopped and saved that poor animal, instead you let your car take control. Also what if it just shuts down? Turns off completely in the middle of the road. All electronics have a point in time where they are slow and slowly begin to shut down. How long would you have the car to keep? Do you think a driverless car can last you up to 10 years? Maybe if your lucky. The weather and the technology cant keep up and hold its together as long as a gas opperated automobile is. What if it doesnt let you take control because it malfunctions and you end up hurting someone? Like it says in the text ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture?

Also, what even is the point to have an automotive that still needs you in the car. If its not smart enough to drive without needing your assistence it would be useless. So say you are driving down the street and your texting and letting you car drive on its own. All of a sudden it crashes and hurts other including yourself. It would still be your fault even though you was not the one driving. In other words if you get in a car accident would the police put your car in jail or you? Well you offcorse if your even recovered from the crash your car has put you in anyways. Driverless cars allows drivers to think they can keep their eyes off the road when all reality they have to pay attention and be alert. If you have to have your eyes remained on the roads at all times then you might as well drive, atleast you will be secure and more alert.

Finally the car over all is just a big mimic. People are tying to develope objects with human like qualities. In the text it even says ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" Personally I believe being human is special and an automobile can never be as special as a human life. Yes we may love our cars but never as much as one would love there children, friends, or family.

Driverless cars are just an overall bad idea and we should keep our state safe and the people in it. I'm not the only one who agrees. Driverless cars are illegal in most states. In the text it mentions ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" This shows that im not the only one who belives they are not safe and no matter what upgrades and assumptions that are made will not make a driverless car a good idea. Lets be original and stick to the safe way lets avoid the one car, one life, one accident.              ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

0459116,"Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.(The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able  to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.                                                                               ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

04b354e,"Walking into the voting booth ""...every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November"" (Office Of Federal Register 6), the people of the United States of America expect their vote to count. Although, the president is elected in a more indirect way, by the electoral college, which does not represent the people, and is not fair. The president should be elected by popular vote from now on.

The first problem that the electoral college faces is the fact that it does not truly represent the opinion of the people. First, voters can walk into the booth and ""...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is ""rare"";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.

Looking deeper into the subject, elections by the electoral college are not fair. The first example appears in the method of the ""...""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""(Office of Federal Register 7). Because of this system, Presidential candidates may not feel the need to campaign to all people, just those of the states with the highest amount of electoral votes(Plumer 13). This goes against the american concept of ""all men are created equal"", leaving voters feeling undervauled and not important. Second, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.."" (Posner 18). Although this tie is claimed to be ""highly unlikely"". However, an election by popular vote would make the conundrum even further unlikely by the general logic of the fact that it is a lot less possible for the opinion of an entire nation to be split down the middle than that of 538 electors. Another issue with a tie in the electoral college lies in how that draw is resolved. The  tie-breaker is left to the representatives in congress, and ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming...would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California..."" (Plumer 12). This simply does not give all the voters equal say in who wins the election. All of these topics and more compressed together represent how un fair the election truly is.

Entering the booth next election day, dont only think about who you are voting for, but also how you are voting for them. It makes all the difference, and, ultimately, the popular way is the best way.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

05592d5,"People over the years that have been talking about cars that drive themselves have found this topic very interesting because of the phrase"" Cars that drive themselves"". Yes it sounds interesting and very cool and far into the future but there are downsides to this idea and there are some good sides. It depends on the people that you ask because some could say oh no way! Then there are some that could say oh yes way! Then you have to think of it this way, are these futuristic cars even safe for humans to be in?

Driverless cars do sound really cool to me because then you don't really need to do anything but sit back and watch. Then again I just don't think that I would want a car that drives itself only because of the dangers it kind of puts you in. For example, in the passage it states that these cars have all of these sensors on it that can keep you safe while you're driving it, well what do you do if while that car is driving and one of the sensors malfunctions and there is a car running a stop sign while it's your turn to go what do you do? You won't even see the car coming from the side of you and that sensor malfunctioned so it can't alert the car then you get smacked into by the other vehicle. These cars do come with very dangerous factors and possibilities that can happen at any given moment. So yes these cars are cool but I would never get one for myself.

In paragraph two when it talks about how television and movies have been fascinated with cars that drive themselves, I think it can be a bad thing for them doing that. That's because the way movies and TV portray the driverless cars is so unreal but others who don't understand that well, they could be in a good amount of danger. For example in the movie Transformers, every single one of those cars drive themselves. They steer themselves, they can open their own doors, they can do all of this stuff and someone who actually believes that that is what these manufacturers are coming out with, then they are wrong because they think that it will be able to do that stuff and while they're distracted BOOM! They just got t- boned by another driver because the person wasn't paying attention. These cars could really cause a lot of danger to society.

Driverless cars are way too dangerous to me, I feel like people would be irrisponsible with them and cause harm to the community. I'm against cars that drive themselves for right now until they can proove to me that these cars are 100% safe. Like we all know today there are crazy drivers out thtere and with them on the road with a car like this, that could put a ton of people in danger. To help prove my whole point in paragraph 9 it says that ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer""? Well here is the thing, it said if the technology fails. That means that there is a chance of the technology failing and causing harm, just like a lot of other technology can do. For example, some sort of saw to cut wood or metal. If one of those things malfunctions and a blade goes flying it could hit someone and easily kill them. Not all technology is 100% fool proof so that is why I wouldn't trust this driverless car.

So once again I do not support the creation of one of these driverless vehicles because of a safety issue. Even if this car does have all of these sensors on it that doesn't mean that it is totally safe because you still have all of these other crazy drivers on the road that could potentially smack into if they aren't paying attention or even if you aren't paying attention. Yes in the movies these cars do look really cool but I don't think that they need to be created and brought into real life. I say that we just stick to what we already do. That's having actual people drive the car instead of having a computer programmed into the car driving it. Now I know people don't drive 100% either but what if the technology fails and someone dies in a crash? Then what do you do?

0668f09,"The breeze of the late summer air, it's fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coinsided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.

To begin with, banning cars/reducing them will benefit our ecosystems and enviornments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog; it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing (Source 2). That CO2 rises into the air, the atmopshere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of car-pooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3; and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael Sivak brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, ""Mine (19 and 21) [speaking of her children] have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

Alongside with the bettering the enviornment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the city/town. In Bogota, Columbia (according to Source 3) new paths have been opening up, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city,"" stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks; DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.

In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the enviornment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and check-up like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice.                                            ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

What if when you drove your vehicle there was a computer driving next to you and driving you? Google and GE have made self driving cars that survey the surrounding area to have all the peripheal vision as a human and drive for the human. Google estimates the vehicles would use half the fuel used today and that these cars would fundamentally change the world. Self-driving cars use computers that proccess situations and scenarios just as well if not better than humans, still allow some control through construction or traffic, and elliminate the despised people that text, do make up, or eat while driving.

Most people would agree that computers are smarter than people and can proccess situations and scenarios faster than people too. For instance, I know of no one that can do math faster than a scientific calculator. So why not have a computer drive for us. In the end it would result in safer transit and maybe even earlier arrival itme. Smart cars, as the leading industrys call them, use a spinning sensor on the roof of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Humans can only see so much through their two eyes while maintaing eyes on the road. These cars are maintaing a constant image of their surroundings, not just what is in front of them. This leads to safer travel and ultimately smart cars driving better than humans.

While the computers do have a complete 360 degree view around them, they still require human interaction. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" a car than can handle speeds up to 25 mph by itself. This smart car has special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel to ensure that in case of an emergency the driver can safley navigate out of it and overide the computer's autopilot. These smart cars allow you to steer, accelerate, and brake, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as driving through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must stay alert and ready to take control at a moments notice in case of an emergency, so humans are not completely out of control.

With all the technology and distractions at the wheel a world where the technology drove the car might not be such a bad idea. For example, there have been multiple accidents a year due to texting while driving. In many states you can get pulled over by the police for doing things such as texting at the wheel. But what if smart cars made the world safer from texting and driving, or make up at the wheel, or even the people that eat meals or take drinks while in transit. With smart cars people that do those things will have trouble doing them if they have to keep hands on the wheel, but if they still manage to get a text or bite of food, the smart cars will be in control and there to steer them to safety. This would keep not only the people who text and drive, eat, or do make up safer but the people around them would also be away from that danger that they themselves can not control.

Smart cars might not be the first thing many people jump at as the way to go. But smart cars might be one of the safe options to eliminate human error and reduce accidents, drving casualties, and risks. Smart cars are just as equal if not smarter than humans, they are not in full control in case of emergencies, and they can save a life if there is a driver texting, eating, or doing make up at the wheel. I would certainley choose the computer driving me, my friends and coworkers around for my safety and theirs.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

08519b2,"Since Henry Ford made the first Model T, people have been obsessed with the idea of transportation.  This idea has evolved into many things between then and now.  We now have entire sports dedicated to cars and motorcycles, cars powered by alternate energy sources, and many other novel concepts that have taken the world by storm.  However, there are many potential advantages of limiting your use of our precious automobiles.

One of the first reasons that you should reduce your usage of cars is found all around us, in the environment.  Some statistics of the current amount of damage we cause by using our cars like we do include that fact that passenger cars are responsibel for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some areas of the United States.  Imagine if we could reduce those numbers?  David Goldberg, and official of Transportation for America (a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United states), said ""How much you drive is as important as whether you drive a hybrid.""  There are some places that are taking this concept to heart.  One example of this is in Bogota, Columbia, where on certain days every year, a Day Without Cars in the captial city leaves only buses and taxis with permission to be on the roads.  Despite the rain on the third time the event took place, the turnout was still great.  There were even other cities, Cali and Valledupar, that took part in the fun.  Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic about what they saw.  The country of Colombia has made a concious effort to reduce their carbon footprint since the mid-1990s.  Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicicyle paths as well as parks and sports centers have also cropped up.  This also in turn resulted in an improved economy as new restaurants and upscale shopping distrcits have cropped up. The current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has also recently unveiled ambitious goals to curb the US's greenhouse gas emmisions.  Wouldn't it be great if we could all help the environment out by reducing our usage of cars?

How great would it be, if at the same time as leanding the earth a helping hand, you were able to improve your own happiness?  In Vauban, Germany and several other places globally, this has already begun to take effect.  The people of this city are part of the ""Smart Planning"" movement.  This experimental community on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders, is taking reducing autombile usage to a whole new level.  Seventy percent of Vauban's families simply do not own a car.  Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two living in Vauban, said ""When I had a car, I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way,"" as she walked the verdant streetes where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering people drown out an occasional distant motor.  The ""Smart Planning"" movement isn't just restricted to this place though.  It is merely an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use.  In Bogota, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" on a Day Without Cars.  Some may still say though, ""How if by giving up my car, will I be happier?  I will have to find some other transportation mean and potentially have to wake up much earlier than I already to get everywhere.  That seems more stressful to me.""  However, due to the recession in the US, many people are having to do adapt this type of lifestyle out of necessity.  Many can't afford new vechiles but still must get to work somehow.  Even after the recession ends, many sociologists believe that many will not return their previous way of life.

Finally, there are already many plans in place to reduce automobile usage.  At the

Mobile World Congress in 2012 in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan that shows how impractical or undesireable it will be for many to own a vehicle.  He also proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create ciries in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.""  The Environment Protection Agency as well as legislators are promoting the reduced use of personal vehicles by working to induct a new six-year federal transportation bill, rather than previous ones that have devoted about eighty percent of the appropriations have gone to highway improvements and the remaining twenty percent to other transport.

To wrap everything up, there are many reasons that everyone should try to reduce automobile use.  For one, it will help the environment, it will increase general happiness, and finally, that there are plans that are already in place to make it more feasable for people to adopt this new lifestyle.  Whether we will see a drastic change or not, we will not know until we try.  But that all starts, with you.            ",5,3.5,,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue of reducing automobile usage.

08cdf6e,"We all hide our emotions at one point or another but, what if we had the technology that could detect whatever were feeling despite if were trying to hold them in or not. The Facial Action Coding System or FACS is just that piece of technolgy that is capable of detecting any given emotion. Dr. Huang inventor of this software has even modified it to were it can find out any emotion or emotions all at once. It's been questioned should this kind of technolgy be used in classrooms for students. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in the classroom because, if any student is having troubles on the actvity at hand the Facial Action Coding System could detect that modify the prompt and make it easier for the student to then understand. Second, this software could help you better understand someone and their well-being being able to see exactly what's making them happy and what's making them upset. Third, it's better way for human and computers to ""communicate or interact"".

Anybody couldn't say that they haven't had problems understanding something at any given point in time. Simpily because, everyone can't understand everything right away with no problem/obstacle getting in the way weither it being how the words are phrased or if the vocabulary is too hard to comprehend. FACS could solve this issue right away. As presented in the passage ""Dr. Huang predicts, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" therefore making it easier for the student or user to understand what is being asked or written. Solving probems much quicker than the instrustor could explaining the information piece by piece.

Understanding emotions when communicating with someone is key. Yet, we might not recognize all that are being distrubed to us. Another great reason for FACS to come into play. As stated in the passage ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This is all very true we can't comprehend every emotion that's more dull or hidden. So why don't we get a little help at recognizing more emotions. With FACS we can better understand someones true feelings inside and their well-being. This can than lead to possibly help solving some of the persons unsolved issues and other ""troubling thoughts."" Helping them become of the better verison of themselves.

In our generation today technolgy is something that we live and breath. It's important that we become familair with technolgy and being able to use it properly and effectifly. ""Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate."" Now isn't this perfect? Huang can help us better understand computers and help computers better understand us. If students will be using computers 24/7 why not have the proper setup for them. If the software gets used in the way it's meant to it can overall have a positive effect towards the situation. After some time the computer can develop how the student or user works and operates and what they can understand and can not. Having a large postitive impact. Greater increasing the student's grades, confidence, and potentional in class. Allowing them to fully understand the content be covered better than they would ever before.

In conculsion, the Facial Action Coding System or FACS is valuable in the students classroom because, it can modify the content of the information to be better understood.

These cars are very fesable because they are sought after, the technology is available, and they are getting safer with time.

These driveress cars are some of the most sought after technology that has entered this world. The human has drempt of the flying car for generations, and finaly the idea is fesable. The text referances Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and how he ""envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system,"" (Paragraph 1). Although this is just the dream of one man, millions more people believe that driverless cars are the key to the future. These millions of other people have drempt for driverless cars, and many times their fathers did also. Knowing this, many people will want to get their hands on this new technology that is a driverless car. Making the development of these cars very positive becasue the population will want and has wanted driverless cars for decades. Driverless cars have been a thing of fiction for so many people for so long, but now these cars are a reality.

Not only are they sought after by millions, but the technology for these driverless cars is available and has been available. Driverless cars were always thought to be a thing of the past, but the reality is that they are a thing of the present and have been for many years. The writing points out that, "" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (Paragraph 2). While many people view driverless cars as a thing of the future, Google has formed them to be a thing of the now. This technology, that has been sought after for generations, is now readaly available. It was even said that Tesla has released plans to come out with a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time in 2016. (Paragraph 10). Knowing that these cars are being released this year is over the top of many peoples head, and shows that the development of these cars is indeed helpful. Knowing that the technology is already out in the world shows that the development of these cars grow every single day. This growth will positivly effect the automotive industry, and keep the people making these cars coming out with new and safe versions of these driverless cars.

The one thing that people can control about these cars is their safety. This safety is both for the environment, and most importantly for the drivers of these cars. Indeed, these cars are as safe as they ever will be. We are reminded of the safety of these cars when paragraph eight reminds us that, ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a saftey feature, and saftey is a big concern,"" Not only is the in-car heads-up display a safty feature as it talks about, but reminds us that saftey is the biggest concern that the companies have. This paragraph even mentions how some of the ""fun"" features are for the saftey of the driver, mainly to keep them awake and alert at the wheel even if they are not the drivers. Knowing that saftey is one of the bigest concerns that the companies have for these cars sould be settling because consumers know that the automated cars that they buy would be in top conditions and have a multitude of features that keep both themselves and the passangers safe. One of the many features mentioned was the voice or even a vibrating chair to signal when the car needs a human to control the driving because the road needs the expertise of a human driver. Because these cars are safe, their development is very positive.

The development of these driverless cars should be continued because they are sought after by many people, the technology is available and is being worked on, and these cars are safe and getting safer. By developing these tests, the companies are creating a technology that, to millions of people, is still only a dream. The complications that these cars may have is a minute detail in the ever evolving spectrum that is the saftey of these cars for the people inside an out. Driverless cars are no longer a thing of the future but make up our present in every way imaginable.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

08fbb47,"Is it possible to be too passionte about something? This author wrote an entire article on how challenging but worth it, it would be to visit Venus' crtiical atmosphere. How well does the author describe, or explain, their own opinion? They support this idea very thoroughly by these three things: The idea that life could have lived there before, the conditions are inhumane, and the fact that it could gain insight and can settle our curiosity.

To start, the idea that at one point in time there has acutally been life living on that planet is crazy. In paragraph four, it talks about how at on point there may have been big oceans like that are similar to the ones on earth. We think this because there are many rocky surfaces, such as valleys, mountains, and craters, that can only be formed from water eriodication. When you even look at it, it just look earth like. Obviously it has changed over the years but you can't rule it out. Is it possible there were living things on this planet at once?

Secondly, now the conditions are inhumane. How did they get that way? Paragprah three is all about what it is like on Venus. The temperatures now rise over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The air is absolutely unbreathable as it is made up of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide. Not only is there carbon dioxide floating around in the air, the atmosphere is mostly made up of sulfuric acid which is very toxic to be breathing in that much. The air pressure on Venus is ninety times deeper, or stronger, than the bottom of sea level. If we even tried ot land on Venus none of the metals would last in eight-hindred degrees. There are also many impediments such as erupting volacnos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting. Minus all these problems we would have to find a way around, the author believes that it is still worth it to visit Venus.

Lastly, we would gain so much insight and our curioustiy could be settled. Paragraph eight talks all about this and about how this could open the doors for us to learn new ideas and come up with new technology that could even help up here on Earth. They also state in paragraph eight to support the idea that despite Venus' risky conditions it would still make a worthy pursuit by saying, and I qoute, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Which I interpret as do not let these conditions scare us. We are so smart and we can be creative and find a way around all of these 'problems'.

In conclusion, how opinionated and factual can someone be? How do you know to balance these two things? At times we have to be one-hundred percent curious about what we are writing about because you don't want to write an article on something you don't care about or find important. Overall, how detailed and opionated was the author? In the end, I think that the author did a great job at explaining why they think it would be a worthy pursuit.

0906ee2,"Your feeling ten percent annoyed, fifty percent boared, and thirty percent suprised. Advancements in technology has been brought to an entire new era with facial readers. One computer can tell people how they feel about themselves just by the muscel structure and movements in their face. Who would not want to know what some stranger walking down the street is feeling? I mean, I know I would. Today our generation is amoung the nosiest. Classrooms today need these computers to better understand their class. Emotional expressions can change society by understanding children, making lives easier, and progressing technology.

Children have mood changes as fast as people chose fast food over vegtables. Children are a hard age to understand what they are feeling, becuase they are so quick at changing the things they are doing and always moving. Having a brain wired to becoming board with something one day and then wanting to do it again the nest day. That is hard for teachers to keep up with. Dr. Huang commented, ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or board."" But, with having a computer that classifies the six basic emotions and picks up each one takes a great stress off of teachers. Teachers have a class from anywhere to ten to fourty students. Having to know each one personally and be able to read what they are thinking to help further their education is a big task for underpaid teachers to do. Those fourty students have all different facial structures and the Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track their movements and weight the different units. Teachers understanding their students better with the Coding System, will help them further their education in a classroom when seeing if they are frustrated or upset.

Fourty students, fourty diiferent views, and fourty different emotions. That is a lot to take in. Having the Coding System in your classroom takes the relief off the teachers of figuring out each student. With the easy three step process anyone can read their emotions, but just by video it makes it three steps easier. With no wires and personal information to plug in. Teachers have students that do not like to share their feelings, which takes a lot of time for the teacher to understand what they are feeling taking away from other students. Dr. Huang stated, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Saving the time of teachers and peronalizing lessons for the class creates so many benefits. Not having this machine will not do damage in hurting the students, it is helping them.

Fifty years ago classrooms did not even have a smart board or computer labs, they had chalk boards. It is a fact some people do not like change. Parents probably did not like their children learning how to use computers or new technology. But our world is advacing, and makes it that much amazing to see how simply technology is helping change classrooms for the better. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are developing ways for us and computers to communicate. People think that is scary and weird. The fact is, we can learn about the artwork from hundreds of years ago with the sytem. Classrooms can have precise and exact answers with the system. Huang used Mona Lisa and they figured out that she was 83 percent happy, and 9 percent disguested. Can your art teacher tell you that?

Technology is helping further our classrooms education and learn abilites.

Classrooms benefit from the Facial Coding System. Many people will be against this new change, but they have no arguement. The Facial Action Coding System is easy, helpful, and dependable. As a teacher I would feel more comfortable with giving a lesson and teaching views ,they all understood and agreed with. Lives can change by understanding childrens minds, creating hard ache free lives, and keeping up with the new technology. ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

098d10a,"The planet Venus may be one of our most valuable assets to understand our planet, but Venus has some dangers we cannot ignore. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a good job of suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers by explaining the value of exploring Venus, the dangers, and how the dangers may be overcome.

Venus is very similar to Earth, sharing approximate densities and sizes. The planet also shares geographical features with Earth, such as rocky sediment, craters, and mountains. It is possible that hundreds of years ago Venus really might have been the twin planet to Earth. Astronomers have reason to beleive that Venus was home to oceans and various life forms. If we learn more about this planet, we could find the key to unlock the knowledge of how our home planet works. This supports the author's claim that we must study Venus further by providing reasons knowledge of Venus would directly affect everyday life on Earth.

The author also uses the possible dangers of exploring Venus to explain why we must pursue Venus, through all the challenges. Venus has a heavy atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide, making it impossible for humans to breathe freely on the planet. The pressure on Venus is so great that a person would be crushed, not to mention the extreme temperatures over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit. It would be impossible for an astronaut to explore on the planet's surface without proper technology. Adding to the already intense conditions, Venus has volcanoes, eartquakes, and frequent lightning, which present their own problems. The dangers help prove the author's point that even though dangerous, we must explore Venus.

The author describes possible solutions created by NASA to show that it will be possible to explore Venus, even with the dangers. NASA has proposed an idea of humans studying Venus from a vehicle hovering the planet, but this would not be optimal because the exploration would be very limited. Viewing Venus from thirty feet above would be better than no exploration at all and would create livable conditions, so it is a relatively safe option for gathering knowledge on the planet. Another idea is using mechanical computers on Venus. The computers can make calculations, without electronics. These computers are also more likely to withstand the extreme conditions of Venus, unlike modern computers. No plan can be one hundred percent safe, especially in a danger zone like Venus, but the benefits outweigh the risks. The author does a proficient job of portraying this in the article.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author presents the idea that Venus should be studyed intently, despite the risks. The author does a good job of explaining this by telling how we could benefit from knowledge of Venus, telling the dangers, and solutions to overcome the dangers of Venus.

09c0506,"Dear Rick Scott,

Every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, the Electoral College casts their votes to elect the new President of the United States of America. These voters are chosen by the citizens of their state (Florida, Texas, etc.) to vote in their favor of their preferred party. For example, a Democratic voter in California will vote for Democratic Electoral College canidates to vote for their preferred President. Though many people are apposed to this method of voting, calling it an anachronism & taking away the vote from the citizens of the United States, American citizen's votes still count, the Electoral College can avoid problems popular voting could result in, and the Electoral College listens to those with the initiative and right to make a smart vote. For these reasons I would like to keep the Electoral College.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by a vote of Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, meaning one vote almost relies on the other. A common misconception made by citizens is that when they vote they vote for a President, when in fact they are voting for people to vote in their favor for the President. So the more Republican Electoral College voters your state has, most likely the end vote will be the electoral votes go to the Republican canidate. Many people say that the electoral college ""takes away the votes of the citizens, and that their vote doesn't matter"" when in reality, they matter in every way possible. If the citizens do not vote, who will vote for the electoral college members? And without the citizens to decide who the memebers of the Electoral College will be, who will be in the Electoral College all together?

Not only do the Citizen's votes count, but the Electoral College can help solve the problems that a popular voting system could have. The Electoral College votes with the majority of the state, meaning that the party with the highest request for its Presidency, the Electoral College will cast its votes towards. Meaning a highly Democratic state can count on their state's vote to most likely be for the Democratic candidate. The Electoral College also avoids run-off elections. This means that the election will always show a clear winner for the state's vote. There is a lot of potential pressure for a run-off election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cats; that pressure could greatly affect the Presidential election process, which the Electoral College reudces, ultimatley showing a clear winner.

And finally, the Electoral College listens to smart and eligible voters. Very rarely does a State's Electoral College vote against the wishes of their citizens. In fact that would be the exact opposite of their job. It's also an inetible fact that not every voter is an ideal voter. Many citizens do not keep themselves up to date on the issues candidates plan to solve, occupation backgrounds, or even their personality. Many voters in fact vote on astetics, which is ultimatley the most dangerous voter there is; an uner educated one.

So Mr. Scott, I hope you take into account that an in terms of an electoral college, an American citizen's vote does count, they avoid the problems popular votes could create, and they do listen to their state's smart, eligable voters. If the Founding Fathers created this tool for the balance in our voting system, then balance there shall be.             ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

0aaae26,"Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the Electoral College, must be changed.  Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote.  The Electoral College is unecessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated.  Source 1 says that the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers.  This begs the question, how can a system so old still be practical and in use today?  This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.

There are so many things that could go wrong with the Electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives.  According to Source 2, if this were to happen, than, ""the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""  This, of course, would not reflect the nation's vote, and would anger millions of people.  If we elected the president by a popular vote, than the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.

Another flaw of the Electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election.  Even though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3.  ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.""  This is a major flaw of the Electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people.  Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation's vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system.  This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the Electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.

The popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States.  According to Source 2, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""  If this is the preferred voting system, and the Electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote?  It only makes sense.  Not to mention, if the Electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of who the nation wants as their leader.

Some may argue that the Electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it ""produces a clear winner,"" (Source 3.)  But, the information given above disproves these unvalid arguements.  If the Electoral College is such a great system, than why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation's votes still win the election?  Will it always produce a clear winner?  What about the event of a tie?  Or, what about when the ""winner"" did not win the majority of the votes?

In conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the Electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary.  The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

0b5c44b,"Alien comics are the real deal?

The average conspiracy theorist might think the picture of the ""Face"" was created by aliens but science and reasearch shows otherwise. Many people connect space with aliens but it's all really fiction. Everyone wants to believe that those comics and fairytales they used to read when they were younger are actually real. So any piece of information from mars that could be the slightest bit connected to earth makes everyone go bananas! Here is why your ideas and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas Are way off.

First, How are you putting out their ideas and beliefs but we have yet to see you guys give any evidence whats so ever. See, The team at NASA has actually done research and it's our job. When we went out to the sight where the ""Face"" is located Us and other scientists figure it was just another Martian mesa, Also, these are common around cydonia, Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Next, If this accusation was in deed Truthful why in the world would we hide this from anyone!? It would honestly help us and make us even more financially stable.

Even when we revealed the picture it engaged many common citizens and it attracted attention to mars. So, even if the whole alien thing was true it would really benfit the people. Not only are they going to learn about possibly Alive aliens but they get to learn even more about mars and how they function in space.

Also, We've provided all the evidence that we possibly can. We even went back out to The sight and took pictures again to prove these you and the rest of the conspiracy thoerists wrong. When we went back out to the sight we used a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

Now you and many might say ""Well i still don't think their telling the truth, their probably hiding something because it might discredit them and their business.""

Well, NASA and the rest of the scientist have done all we can. Our job is to explore space and find new things that might help us on earth. So, after all the reseach we've done. Plus all the trips we've made back out there to provide the community with evidence and pictures and you guys still don't believe us thats your problem. When conspiracy theorist provide us with 100 percent credible and sufficent information then we can look into it more but for now you guyses Arguement is full of opinions.

In conclusion, This is how you and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas are very false and irrelevant. NASA has been in business for awhile now and we like to be looked at as very honest, diligent and hardworking people. We do not at all appreciate you and you team degrading us. We spend thousands and thousands of dollars each mission just so we can have evidence and Information that is accurate. We take our jobs very seriously. After speaking with you today i hope you can rethink your ideas and your beliefs because we've done everything we could to provide you and the rest of the people with good sources to support our decision and our arguement.

0b9d88d,"Driverless cars are cars with an automated driving system. Cool right? Using binary code, sensors and even 3-D imaging to check surroundings. Sounds futuristic like something from Back to The Future or Star Trek. But what good could they really do in society. Driverless cars are coming but should they? Society today can do better without technology controlling even more of our lives and something so vital as cars.

Google has gotten a head start on this process of driverless cars. The article states the car can ""read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code."" Yes the car is smarter than the average human being, that's because it's a computer. A computer cannot make judgement calls like a human being. With the intent on not crashing a driverless car could make mistakes and not know that they are mistakes. Such as hitting a child in order to avoid crashing into a tree. Something this article did not touch on was that the Google self driving car had its first accident last week when it hit the side of a bus in Northern California.

Today we have sensors and cameras in our cars but the driver maintains the speed, directions and trajectory of the car and where it goes. Humans must remain alert at all times, as stated in this article. Even though with self driving cars there is no human error involved consequences could emerge from there being to many of these types of automobiles on the road at once.

If this car goes into mass production problems will emerge just like with every other car brand. We have today many tools to assist our cars in knowing when to stop, turn and check coolant and power steering levels. We are still in control. In the article isn't was stated that if a problem should arise ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" What if this function doesn't work? Should the driver always have to hands on the wheel or would that ruin the point of this driverless car.

Is society ready for this or is this years in the making and we are just getting ahead of ourselves. Either way self driving cars should not be allowed on the street without a driver until the technology is 100% proven error free. This could take some time but it's worth it. This will significantly limit the cost of lives that could come from unnecessary laziness caused by this driverless car.

0cae471,"The auhtor begins with information about Earth's twin, known as Venus, has been a scientific question for decades. One of the brightest points of light in the sky and somewhat the closest planet to earth looks and proximity wise, is in fact Venus. Venus may be very easy to see from a long distance, but the closer you get the more danger you are in. There are manyreasons on why scientists and astronomers keep going back to venus and attempting after many fails.

Considering that Venus is sometimes, depending on the speed in which Venus orbits the sun, the closest planet there are hardships on why humans cant land a spacecraft on it. Sending a spacecraft to Venus has been done numerous times, but not one survived more than just a few hours. This issue has caused Nasa to be discouraged and havent sent a spacecraft in over three decades. "" each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours""( paragraph.2) This is just one reason on why Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to study.

The author states that Venus' atmosphere holds clouds made of sulfuric acid which is highly corrosive, melting most metals into liquid. On the surface, tempatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit as an average. Venus has the hottest surface tempature in our whole solar system. The air pressure is 90 times in what we experience on our own planet. These condiotions are far more worse than what an average person encounters on Earth, let alone a professional astronaut. Venus' environment alone could combust a submarine made to withstand the deepest parts of our oceans. The author also says that Venusian weather and geology have presented additional information such as erupting volcanoes, frequent lightening strikes, and powerful earthquakes. So why does the author think that studying Venus is worth these dangers?

The author found that scientists are discussing further visits to Venus becasue once a long time ago Venus might have been home to various forms of life. The planet holds a surface of rocky terrain and similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Given the long time frames of space travel, Venus is the nearest option, yet still isnt safe enough. "" the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" ( paragraph 2). NASA brought forth a very compelling idea for sending humans to Venus in order to study the planet. NASA's solution is for humans to hover above Venus' harsh ground conditions at 30 or so miles above the landscape. Temperatures will still be at a whopping 170 degrees Fahrenheit, and air pressure similar to sea level on Earth. Not easy but survivable for humans, this is the best idea NASA could provide. Although seeing Venus from a blimp like ship hovering safely above the planet would provide only limited insight on ground conditions, because some forms of light cannot penetrate Venus' dense atmosphere. As well as sight, astronauts cannot take samples from 30 plus miles in the air of the gas, rocks, or soil.

Despite these hardships, NASA is formulating other approaches to studying Venus. The author provided examples on their ideas such as simple electronics made of silicone carbide have been put in a chamber simulating the chaotic nature of Venus, and survived at least three weeks in these conditions. In conclustion the author supported this idea very well, and had a lot of information about the hardships and ideas formulating our jpurney to study Venus. I think that we will find the answer someday and unlock the many secrets that Venus' harsh conditons and unfriendly nature have kept hidden for so long. "" Our travels on Earth snd beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" ( paragraph 8) ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

0cc9cb5,"The electoral college is pointless, I believe that it is just another step that was added to the long process of picking our new president. It causes problems between the people and the government and it takes away time that we could be using to do something actually beneficial to our country. The electoral college is not a place but a group of people who meet and vote for the President and Vice President. Each state gets represented by a certain amount of electors which is decided by the population of that specific state. The electoral college should be thrown out of the way that we choose our president becuase it upsets the people, it can completley change elections, and because it gives to much power to the legislative branch.

I think that the electoral college gets people frustrated with our government. They have to go basically vote for another person to vote. If I lived in texas I would go to a poll and vote for the person that I wanted to put up in the electoral college. That person would then vote for the president. It makes voters, mad why spend time for voteing on people who you dont really care about when you could honeslty just vote for the President who you believe could help our country. The biggest argunment against the electoral college is that it we can't control who our elector votes for. You see when you go to vote for an elector you normally vote for one who says that they are going to vote for the person that you like, but they can change their mind and now you voted for someone that is going to vote for the candidate that you didnt want.

The electoral college can completely change the direction of a vote. Becuase voters only have one vote, the electors represent alot of the states population. For example a single representitive from samller states like Wyoming can represent of to 500,000 voters and in bigger states like California can have up to 55 electors who represent as much as 35 million people. This is why the electoral college can have such a big effect on the voting proces exspecially since the electors represent such a large amount of people. It can become frustrating when a large mass of people ellect some one and that elector changes there mind about  who they vote for, because a group of people as large as 500,000 can be ruiting for one person and the elector can change his mind and now that group 500,000 is voting for someone that they don't like.

Another problem is that the electoral college gives to much power to legislative branch ""Back in 1960 segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy becuase it would have been overthrown by the college. Which meens that the Legislative branch has enough power to create a biased slait. The legislature would create a group of electors that are all in favor of certain idea and you wouldnt be able to vote for anyone else becuase those are the people for your state. The point of voting is to give power to the people and with the electoral college in the way it completely takes that away from us. We get to vote for the electors but that doesnt meen that they are going to vote for the people that we want them to.

Yes the electoral college could have some advanteges like allowing professionals to have an input into what is going on, It helps us avoid run-off elections (elections that end up with a tie), and restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. But there are definalty more cons to this procedure. The constitution states that we are here to create a more perfect union but how are we supposed to create a union when the government is basically in control of everything. There is no unity gouing on in our government it more like the government is in charge and we are kind of just here. If we get rid of the electoral college it will make the people happier and allow them to actually feel like part of the government, It will stabilize elections and not allow the legistaure to change them, and will take away some of the numerous powers that the Legislative branch holds.

Having technology that can detect when a student is enjoying a specific lesson or action, is not valuable due to the fact that the student's facial expression may have more to do with than just the lesson being learned. The Facial Action Coding System would be able to tell if a student is sad or happy, or frusterated, or disgusted. But it does not have the technology to determine prior emotions, or the cause of them. Therefore, Facial Action Coding Systems are not valuable in classrooms. However they may be useful elsewhere, such as doctors offices, and airports.

Although the author gives a practical use of his product, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a studnet is becoming confused or bored."" Students go through a fair amount of stress throughout the year, and can witness or partake in many activities which can be detromental. This is where the author's claim is no longer valid.

For instance, maybe a second grader gets into school one day, and is distrought because his or her mom and dad got in a divorce the night prior. This is a scenario where the Facial Action Coding System is not going to be able to benefit the kids learning based off of his or her facial expressions. Another example includes highschoolers. What if a boy or girl is being bullied and not reaching for help and bottling all of their emotions in. A system that recognizes facial expression would not be worth having at that time because the system would base its opinion off of what the student is learning, even if the student may be enjoying what they are learning. This is just one case where the Facial Action Coding system would not be valuable.

Although the Facial Action Coding System may not be useful in school classrooms, their is practical application outside of the classroom. For instance, what if a little kid gets signed out of school because they are sick. The mom would most likely take the kid to the doctors to get them examined, if they are truly sick the Facial Action Coding System may be useful to tell if the kid is truly sick, or if they are most likely faking it, prior to the actual visit with the doctor. It may also be useful in principals offices. The Facial Action Coding System may be of use when a student makes a report. If the students emotions can be told as angered, or distraught, it may further prove that the student is actually being truthful, not just trying to get someone in trouble.

Another great use of the Facial Action Coding System is in airports around the world. The system could be of use to tell if someone is of threat or is in an unstable condition prior to boarding the plane. Airport officials could analyze reults of suspected threats before allowing them on a plane. This application would be more practical than it being used in classrooms.

Although I believe that the Facial Coding System is not of use in classrooms, the technology would be great if applied elsewhere. The authors opening sentence in paragraph nine may be the solution to classrooms. ""Putting on a happy face actually works."" This small quote may help lighten a students day more so than a system trying to fix what is wrong by changing what they are learning. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

0d18ff3,"Technology can be beneficial in several aspects of everyday life, but reading emotions should not be one of them. According to the article, the technology to read human emotions is possible and can be effiecently used to detect how a person is feeling. This technology is certainly impressive but does not seem very beneficial to the average student and can be seen as slightly intrusive. Therefore, this technology would not be valuable in a classroom due to the small amount of benefit that it would provide and its intrusiveness, as students should have a right to keep certain emotions and feelings to themselves.

It seems unnecessary to use this technology when emotions are already fairly easy to identify without the use of a computer. Body language and facial expressions can already easily be analyzed by humans themselves to reveal emotions. To quote the writer of the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto 5). This depicts that technology is not required to identify the basic emotions of a human being and is therefore unnecessary.

If a person is not blatantly showing his emotions with body language and facial expressions, then the person wold likely prefer not to express what he is feeling or thinking. All human beings have a natural right to keep their thoughts and emotions to themselves as they please, and technology that can reveal emotions at their deepest depths can be intrusive. An example of this can be how computers use cookies to track what people are searching on the Internet in order to produce advertisements directed toward the user later on, which often disturbs people and makes them feel uncomfortable. This may be the same situation if computers have access to human emotions. The private feelings of a human should not be exploited by a computer, and therefore trespasses a basic right of humans which allows them to have their own private thoughts and emotions.

The final reason that this technology would not be valuable is because there are little uses for it. Detecting emotions are not really relevant when using a computer. The author of the article states many examples of how this technology can be used on a computer, and the use of using the emotions to determine the type of advertisements would match emotions and what the user is feeling does not seem very important or beneficial. Overall, the implementation of technology into a student's everyday life would not be useful, therefore making it seem pointless rather than valuable.

Therefore, the idea of implementing technology that read emotions would not be valuable in a typical classroom. Despite the consistency of the technology working successful, it would be worthless to bring into everyday lives as people do not need advanced computers to identify other people's emotions. The technology would also be extremely intrusive, as it would exploit the private thoughts and emotions of people that would not want their emotions to be detected and make them feel slightly uncomfortable. Alongside these reasons, there is practically no use for this advanced technology in a typical day of an ordinary student. For these reasons, while the concept of reading emotions may be interesting, there is not much benefit that will come from the use of this technology and therefore implementing it into classrooms would be a prodigious waste of money and effort in order to provide a minimal benefit for students.

0db7e99,"Being in a classroom with a large amount of students can be intimidating. This makes it easier for a student to fall behind in a classroom setting, since they may be too scared to ask a question. One may be thinking, ¨what if they laugh at me if I raise my hand?¨ Or maybe that student may need a different teaching approach, but they do not know how to convey this to them. There could be a solution to this problem. New technology uses a computer that ¨constructs a 3-D computer model of the face¨ (¨Making Mona Lisa Smile) it can be used to process the emotions that a student may be feeling. Meaning that technology reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and beneficial.

Reading the emotions of students can help the teachers gather more beneficial data on them. As they constantly say that ¨they are not mind readers.¨ However many students may be embarrased that they are not quite understanding the content. To which this technology could provide some assistance. The computer could simply read and see what percentage of the class is confused. If it is a large percentage then that means the teacher can go over it as a whole class. Also working vise versa meaning that if it is a smaller percentage then the teacher can make smaller groups and provide the needed attention to them. This theory was stated by Dr. Huang, ¨´A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,´ Dr. Huang predicts. ´Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor´¨ (¨Making Mona Lisa Smile¨). Although the article refers to online classes the same can be applied to the human interative classroom. The teacher can look at the data during the lesson to check understanding along the way and then provide the extra needed support to those that need it. Then let those that understand it move forward. That way the children don´t fall behind, and the children that understand the content can be further challenged. Providing a more effective and rigourous courseload.

Another benefit that this technology presents is that it can read the distressing emotions of a student. Especially during the high school years which are very stressful in both the workload and character development. A teacher is able to see if that student is upset, angry, or stressed. Or even a combination of these emotions because ¨By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci´s masterpiece)¨ (¨Making Mona Lisa Smile¨). If a student had a particularly stressful event go on in their household they may feel angry, frustrated, and sad. The teacher can then understand that they are going through a moment and be sure to provide some support. Also if the students are feeling especially stressed the teachers may even provide some kind of stress relief day, since prolonged stress can have some serious effects on the human body. This technology may even be able to detect mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety. To which the student can be provided with the support that they need. Possibly leading to the prevention of suicide attempts and anxiety attacks.

In conclusion, having technology in the classroom can be extremely beneficial to both the students and the teachers. It can provide useful data to the teachers. To which they can adjust their teaching plan accordingly, and effectively educate all the students. Futhermore it can help students dealing with mental health issues. Making sure that they get the help and support that they need in order to be the most attentive in the classroom as they can be. As technology continues to be implemented into the teaching program this computer software should be considered as well. ",5,3.5,,,,".

0dd6015,"Dear Senator,

I believe that the United States deserves someone who will lead this country to do the right thing, to make independent choices, and to be the best version of ourselves we can be every day. Now, how do we know when choosing a leader to represent us if thats what we will acheive when voting? We don't for sure, but we can make judgements and calls that will give us a better understanding to whom we are choosing. One of the biggest fought over rights was the right to vote, in which everyone wanted. Now that we have that vote, we should be able to use that freedom and have a say in who we want to represent us.  Therefore, I think we should change the election to popular vote for the President of the United States rather than relying on the Electoral College.

The Electoral collge consists of 538 Electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party and given their own says and responsibilities. That being said, I think that getting rid of the Electoral College will eliminate all biased decisions and will create more freedom and responsibilities for the people of the U.S. to use their own judgement and choose who they think will best represent the country. Being in the electoral college and being selected to have a heavy say in who will be chosen is a big responsibilty and in that responsibility are duties to not only look at each candidate with one mind set and one point of view but to make an unbiased judgement. To make an unbiased call would mean to put away all your own thoughts and judgements and really get a good understanding of who the people truly need. Back in 1960, it states that segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. How can we tell that something like this will not happen again? Well if we choose to keep the Electoral College it very well could and the people of the country would not be making decisions for themselves as well.

Most worrying comes from the fear of a tie, in which the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one single vote. That single vote from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters could have as much say as the 55 representatives from California who represent 35 million voters. So therefore the election is really only a few swing voters away from a disaster. Because of the winner-take-all system, candidates really dont spend time campaigning in states they think they have no chance of winning, really only focusing on the bigger states with more votes. This is also unfair because then the people with the right to vote do not get a say in who they want to represent their country. The Electoral college really takes away many rights and freedoms to the people of the U.S. and doesnt give us the chance to have a say. Studies even show that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now!

As well as having such a biased voting system, this is such an unfair system due to the fact the the popular vote winner could loose because of the Electoral College voters. This would be a very bad decision to keep the Electoral College especially if these Electoral voters have had their decision swayed by something. Then we will have a president that is only the president because of some voters biased and unfair judgemented calls. If one Electoral College voter has a certain view on a candidate, they could very well share that and somehow persuade the other voters decisions due to one persons thoughts and points of view on the candidate. One person can easily influence many peoples own judgements, which would cause them to choose poorly and only go under the pressure of that persons thoughts. The Electoral College has so many cons which would make it such a bad decision to keep this system and go by a biased and unfair advantage. So I believe that the best thing for the U.S. voting system would be to abolish the Electoral College and to keep the popular vote system so that everyone has their own say on who will acheive great things for our country.

Thank you for keeping my thoughts in mind,

0eb2865,"To whom it may concern,

The growing debate on whether or not the electorial college is necessary for when the country is voting for it's president. I am writing to argue that the electorial college is vitial to the presidential election process becuase it evens out the importance of all the states' votes, gives us a certainty of an outcome, and allows for toss-up states to vote for the best candiate.(Posner) It can be precieved that the electorial college is a non-democratic way of voting for the president. Although it may be seen like that, it is in fact favorable towards the people becuase the electors that you indirectly vote for are voting for the same candidate as you were. The electorial college has been around for decaades and has very few times caused a disruption in our country. Why should we eliminate a process that has worked for years and will continue to work for years to come?

The electorial college should be kept becuase it allows for the smaller states to compete against the larger states in terms of votes for the presidency. A state like California has a larger population than Alaska so in turn they would have more voters. The electorial college evens out the number of people per state that votes so the candidiate chosen is truly who the country wants as the president. A larger state would also get more attention than a smaller state due to it's size difference. Smaller states would get discouraged and soo only the larger and more populated areas would vote becuase they are getting the most attention from the candidates themselves.(Posner) Our country is made up of fifty states and all of them should have an equal imput in who runs our counrty.

Many of the time voters will vote becuase they want to have their party in the president's seat. There are some states that are called swing states that will vote for the president that they beileve will have the best impact on our country reguardless of thei party preference. The electorial college lets the voters from these toss up states vote for the best candidate becuase they are more likely to make thought out decisions because they listen to the candidates proposal and not their party.(Posner) With this in mind, that means that in the end the president chosen is thought to be truly the best winner for the presidency because the toss-up staes chose them over the other.

A dispute is possible when the outcome of the president's election is presented. However, it is likely that a dispute will happen if popular vote were to be the process of electing our president. There is very little chances that the electorial college will have a tie and there is the realisation that if popular voting were to happen, there would be more tied elections happenning. The country wants to have certainty when voting for their president and having the electorial college allows for every state to have a definite candidate and in turn the country can have a definite president by the end of the elections.

The electorial college is vitial when chosing the presdient becuase it gives us certainty in an outcome, evens out the importance of states votes, and gives swinger states an equal vote as well. We need to keep the electorial college and should it be eliminated, it could put our presidential elections at risk. For decades, the electorial college has worked and our founding fathers believed it was necessary. I implore to you thatkeeping the electorial college is the best for the president's elections.

0ec99dd,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile ,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Now for this techology to be used in the classroom I have mixed feelings on weather this is appropriate to use. In the other hand it could potentially increase the student body to be more compatiable with being in school and truly enjoying the enviorment and space that they are in. Due to the fact that the teachers know how the students feel or mentally react to on what is happining.

The reason that I feel that this should not be used in school is the fact that it violates all of the personal and private feelings of a student and the lack of emotions it can tell, According to the text it states "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger , disgust, fear and sadness"". There are more emotions than that. One out of the six actually represent something good and happy the other five are more on the sad and unhappy emotions. Another quote from this article states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"". If that is true then there would no point in for an emotion to tell you how they truly feel. There is nothing better than another warm blodded person with emotions aswell to say something such as hey i can understand what your going through I feel the same way you didn't have to tell me but I knew.

On the other side of the spectrum and saying how this could benifit the students and the teachers is how to make the class or more engaging to the students. As stated in the article "" "" A classroom computer could recpgnize when a student is becoming confused or bored ,"" Dr. Haung predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" "" That could help a lot of students especially the ones eho normally dont like school. Plus this machine will potentially make you happier stated in the article "" The Mona Lisa demonstration is realy intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows you just how much this computer can do."" This coul help people with persay deppresion and confusion on making a choce or big decision on something.

This manchine the "" Facial Action Coding System"" could help with you arround your freinds or a crush/ significant other on how they truly feel twoards something. Aswell as trying or attempting to make them feel better. In the article stated it sites "" For instance, you could probably tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"" This could say help the autistic kids who cant read emotions or conversation ques, and understand them so they dont hurt somebodys feelings. Furthermore, the text states "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them. "" Doing so could help your freind whos having a bad day have a happier one or a loved one because thinking and trying to be happy will actually make you happy.

In conclusion in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I have personaly mixed emotions about this being used in schools as seen. Then again my overal feel of this is posiitive and sholud be regulated within schools. Due to how this may impact the teaching area and enivorment to best help the student or just a person in general.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

0f393ae,"Cars are used everyday to get from one place to another. In some places, people depend on cars more than others that live in different parts of the world. However, the reduction of car usage has many advantages; the planet would grealty benefit from less pollution, traffic jams would not be as frequent, and people become more healthy as a result.

Limiting the use of cars would greatly help the problem of pollution in the world today. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal,

In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, she describes what affects cars have on pollution, ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United Sates"" (Rosenthal). One can clearly see that cars are a major factor in the pollution dilemma that so many peole are trying to resolve. Everyone can take a part in the resolution of reducing pollution by depending less on cars and using other modes of transport such as public transportation, biking, or even walking. Some cities are placing enforcements to ban the usage of cars. Paris is an example of one of these locations. The result of the enforcemnt was that congestion (or smog) went down 60 percent. This is a great improvemnt for the city, which is known for having near-record pollution. Multiplying these enforcemnts to other cities would definitely bring down a large percent of the pollution found on Earth. This is benefiting not only the planet, but also the population that lives on the planet by enabling them to breathe healthier air.

The cause of traffic jams is the abundant amount of cars on the road, which could be avoided if less cars were used. Andrew Selsky wrote in his article,

Care-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a care-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky). With no cars to clog the streets, a relaxed sentiment took the place of a usually anxious and hurried feeling. Rush-hour restrictions were put in act, and have drastically cut traffic. Less honking takes place, and more time is saved in order to get to one's destination. Cars are not always needed to get someone where they want to go, and the enviornment is less stressul without all of the congestion of cars on the road.

People become more healthy when car usage is limited. Instead of taking a car to get from point A to point B, some people are walking or biking instead. This is a huge benefit to the people that are exercising. Also, in

Care-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota, it says that parks and sports centers have bloomed throuhout the city of Bogota because of the decreased usage of automobiles. The parks and sport centers help people stay active and healthy.

Although cars are useful in order to get to one's destination, there are many advantages to cutting back the usage of them. A huge advantage is that pollution would drastically go down. Another is the time and stress saved from less traffic jams. Lastly, people would benefit from the way they are making their lives more healthy.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

0f81127,"It is often said that ""change is good."" This saying is one way to describe my feelings towards the Electoral College. The sources ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefinsible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wronga' by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner show the pros and cons of the Electoral College. The Electoral College should be taken over by popular votes because all Americans should have a say in who their next leader will be.

The Electoral College may disregard what their voters say and vote for another candidate to be our next President. In paragraph 11 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it is declared that ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate."" Voting citizens of America vote for a reason. They vote for who they want to be President, not who the party's electives want to be President. Voters should be able to trust their electors, otherwise their votes are going to a candidate they voted against. Another key point of this unjust way of voting is that people have to put their trust into unknown electors. It is stated in paragraph 16 of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner ""each of the party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."" These electors may be ""trusted"", but to the unknowing voters of America they are ordinary people who could betray someone very easily. All it takes is one elector disobeying his promise to the candidate he chose to represent to have the fate of American changed.

The winner of the election may lose by popular vote and win by electoral votes. This is an unfair advantage that the Electoral College has to the common voters. Voters expect to vote for who they selected, not who the Electoral College selects. It is empahsized in paragraph 10 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer in which ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" In simpler terms, this is saying you don't vote for the next leader, you vote for people who may choose the next leader. The people of America vote for a reason, to choose our next leader who will support our country. They don't vote to have a College of unknown Electors choose the next President. It should also be noted that you're techniacally not even voting for a President. It is disputed in paragraph six of ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" In other words, you don't even choose your candidate, just people who are trusted to vote for them. American voters want to for the nex president, not a board of Electors that they are unsure will trust them.

On the contrary, there is the possibilty of it being a very close election where it would require the Electoral College to choose a President. In paragraph 18 of the source ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Richard A. Posner states ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The popular vote might be back and forth between the Presidents, but an electoral vote would create more of a landslide win. In the end, the cons of the Electoral College outweigh the pros of it.

The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing our country's next leader. The change of this ancient voting would be a very good and appreciatef one. If America really let the people of America choose, they would let the popular vote be the deciding factor for our next President of the United States.               ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

0fc8125,"Dear State Senator,

In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaine. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In Plumer's article he says,"" - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attenetion to the votes sent out. Acorrding to Plumer's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why I believe that  getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had  popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing.

0feef16,"Limited car usage has plenty of advantages. A few examples of advantages that come from limited car usage are lessining the amount of gases polluting the air, also it would create a friendly and neighborly enviorment, and a large amount of money would be saved.

To limit car usage has huge benefits; we can lessen the gasses that are polluted, lessening smog. It may not sound like something that effects your everyday life, but it does. Smog and air pollution are a problem, and a threat to our safety and well being. As of right now it is'nt a life or death situation, but if car usage continues to be a huge part of the world, all the air pollution from all the years of driving are going to get so bad people, and the earths atmosphere will be extremly affected by it. Think about your kids future, would you really want them to live in a world consumed by air pollution, and emission gasses, and smog.. To give an example, ""passneger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states"" (rosenthal). That just showing how much car usage affects air pollution and the air we breath everyday. Just decreasing the amount of car usage can reduce the smog, and air pollution in cities and towns.

Additionally, the less cars are used the more people and neighbors would intteract. If a majority of a town just lessened the amount they go out using a car, they would walk, or ride bikes, or take busses, etc.. imagine your town, and families and their kids taking a walk somewhere, or people riding their bicycles to their destination, everyone could meet their neighbors and talk. Overall, cities and towns and suburben areas would generally become just a friendly enviorment. Most people want to live in a place in which they feel safe and neighborly. Teenagers and families would get more excersise then the normal. Due to having to walk, and ride bikes or other things they would be getting out of the house more instead of sitting in a car then going and sitting some place then going back home and sitting around again, they would get the needed physical activity to stay some what healthy. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day""(selsky). That is amazing, and it is so good for people to get out and do things like that. Lessening car usage could completly change neighborhoods and towns and citiies.

Finally, Cars in the united states are highly expensive, and not everyone has thousands of dollars around to get the car they want/need. ""Cash strapped americans could not afford new cars""(Rosenthal). Just an example that cars are not cheap and a lot of people spend money they do not have on cars. In addition to buying the car, gas must be provided, depending on the car and the amount of gas it uses up, that can be pretty expensive. Insurance is another cost, everyone has to have insurance to be able to drive and own a car, thats a monthly fee coming out of our pockets. Limiting car usage could save a lot of money, it would leave extra money every day, week or month to go out and eat once in a while, or to buy other necisities. Just about everyone wants to have a little extra money, but with a car thats frequently used can use up almost 200 to 400 dollars each month. Riding a bike, or skateboarding or just simply walking is completly free.

Advantages in limited car usage are, The decrease in gas pollution and smog, it could create friendlier neighborhoods and towns, and lastly thousands of people would save a lot of money.                                 ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

102d4b2,"This new peice of technology called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, is able to show peoples emotions and tell when people are hiding and masking their emotions. It is a new peice of technology developed by Prof. Thomas Huang, and Prof. Nicu Sebe. This product is revolutionary in many diffrenf ways. It not only valuable to a modern day life, but it also could have many real-world and technilogical applications.

The FACS system is a new and valuable peice of technology that has many interesting and strong applications. Like it was said im the text, it could adjust an assignment for a student to make it more engaging for them. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (D'Alto). That would make teachers lifes easier, and have less annoyed and out of control students, because they would be doing an assignment they would want to do, and not be extremely bored throughout class. Another way this could be valuable is for when cops do lie detector test. They would be able to pick up movements in the face that could show them that they are lying, or not telling the whole story. There are also many real world applications for this technology out there.

The FACS made by Prof. Thomas Huang could have many real world applications that would make life easier or more fun for some people. One of the many real world applications for this system would be Police Videos. You would be able to see the emotions on the criminal's face while he was being recorded on video, helping the police aid in the investigation. Another brought up by the article could be politics. You would be able to see how the politician is feeling, or which emotions. You would also be able to tell if they are faking emotions they are emitting while they are giving a speech, or if they are outright lying to you. The article itself says ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful."" (D'Alto). The final point I want to bring up is how this could be used for therapy or working through yout problems.

The FACS system could be a great peice of technolgy for therapists to use, working posple through their issues. People could tell how angry or depressed you were actually feeling. It would be a good way to work through the problems you have been facing, because people would know how you are feeling. The machine is able to sense the emotions you have been feeling, so people would be there to comfort you and work through your emotional turmoil. It would make venting about your problems much easier, and less hard to agknowledge

The FACS system is an important and valuable peice of technology for people to use that will most likely become valuable in the near future. It has countless applications, from Police work to Emotional Therapy. In conclusion, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nibu Sebe has most likely make an invalubale innovation in the scientific feild with many real world and scientific innovations.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

10416ad,"Nonverbal communication is often used more than verbal. The way someone stands, moves, or sets their face can tell others more of what they feel then what they are told; however, these social cues aren't always understood. Technology is impacting the world greatly and the Facial Action Coding Software may seem like just another gadget, but it could change the way of teaching to specialize for individuals. Though the thought of computers identifying all emotions is slightly unsettling there are many benefits that may clome along with the software.

In schools, there are many students who struggle with the cirriculum because they do not understand the way it is being taught. From the teacher's point of view, it may look like they are not engaged because the aren't interested in learning the material. It may actually be because they are not understanding the material. A face that looks bored is usually a straight mouth and dull eyes, a confused face could look similar but with furrowed brows. There may not be a noticable difference between a bored face and a confused face that a teaher can spot especially while looking at many faces at a time.

According to the article, the software detects facial movements and compares them to a nutral face to calculate the percent of an emotion someone is feeling. Having this software in classroom computers could benefit both the students and the teachers in many ways. Along with modifying the lesson, the computers could collect data of how a student was reacting during an assignment or during a lecture and then notify the teacher or professor about the results. If many of the students are confused by what is being taught, the teacher could re-word the lectures in a way that might be more clear. If the students are becoming quickly bored of the material then the teacher may need to make some assgnment a little more challenging. The software can also show the teacher when students get exited about certain topics or when they are frightened by an assignment. When assignments are turned in and the result is bad grades, many teachers may assume that the student isn't trying their best, but there may be many other reasons why the work wasn't what was expected. With the facial action software, the teachers would be able to understand why the student didn't do the work properly. If they were confused then the teacher could suggest way to understand better, if the student was bored and didn't try, the teacher may talk about the importance of grades.

Even if this software isn't able to be avalible in schools, learning about facial actions and cues can benefit everyone. The article give instructions to make a happy face by highlighting points that are present in a naturally happy face. Learning instructions to making the faces of many emotions can be a helpful tool in classrooms and in many other environment when communication is needed. Emotions are a very personal thing and it should be the person's choice whether to show their emotions or not; however, this technology in class rooms may improve the teavhing style so that there aren't as many kids struggling to pass their classes.

1085852,"The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed. This process does not fit with what is happening in the present and is outdated. The election should be by popular vote.

There is a disaster factor.  According to ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it's says that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors. The thing is that those electors can betray the trust which has happened before. You do not want to risk having someone defy the will of the people. Some people may argue that the states know what they are doing and are cautious on who to pick, but in the past the electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate. You do not want to put this in hands of someone who will not help you and the other people on such an important event like voting.

When you vote, there is a slight possibility of a tie occuring. If this were to happen, the state delegations would vote on which president. Each state will cast one vote, which is not fair because of the amount of representives in different states. ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" is stated in source 2. Some people may say that the bigger states are helpful with voting because the Electoral College will balance out what the large states loss by the population votes. This still isn't fair because this is saying that the smaller states with less representatives do not have much say in the voting and this will turn off potential voters.

Some presidents may have a stronger appeal to some states then others. It may have to do with where the president is from (North, South). This goes back to how the bigger states have more power. ""...such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states,"" is stated in source 3. This means that the bigger states in the South will be known for all voting Romney since that is where he is the strongest and well liked. There may be voters in the South that were more for Obama. Smaller states may hate what Romney is doing and vote for Obama, but they do not have as much power as the bigger states. This is like the winner takes it all, they may know that they have no chance in winning. (Obama did end up winning and was titled as the 44th President of the United States. To others, they may say that each persons vote does count but it doesn't seem like it. The voters in the South didn't see any campaign ad by Romney which was not fair because he was not concerned about them not voting for him.

The Electoral College is not a fair process. It worked in the past, but not anymore. Using the popular vote process is more fair for all of the people. They have more say and there votes feel more important. This will encourage potential voters to vote and to become more involved with the political events. We need to encourage potential voters because one day, when they become older, they will be the voters of our country.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

10b6508,"Imagine a day where there will be no driver at the steering wheel of a car, problems would eventually arise, specially if there are accidents and people don't know who to blame. Driverless cars that exist today are not entirely driverless, they someone who can take comand if there are traffic problems or construction ahead. Everyday technology advances more and more, some companies believe that in the future there will be cars that opeate by themselves without the need of having someone there incase of a problem, some companies even have a prediction for when such cars will come out into the market. Driverless cars shouldn't be on the road.

First of all, Driverless cars shouldn't be be on the road because they will not be able to operate correctly if there is a problem in the raod. Driverless cars today still need someone there incase there are problems in the road that only humans can take care of, how will a car know what to do in this type of situation, they don't think like people. There are situations that could happen while a driverles car is on the road that sometimes can not be foreseen, therefore the car cannot be programed for such situation. Humans normally know what to do if there are roads constructions ahead or there is something on thee road, like a ditch to avoid, and in these situations how can a car 'see' what goes on in the road. Even if the cars were to have sensors for the outside, what about the inside, if there was a problem with the passanger the car wouldn't be able to tell what to do.

Additionally, driverless cars shouldn't be on the road because how would law apply to them. There are many accidents that happen in the road every day, law is applied in this situations to know who is to take the blame and what to do.

In the situation of a driverless car it would be dificult to pinpoint how law would apply to them, if an accident were to happen, would the manufacturer or the driver be the one to take the balme. There isn't even a driver in this car, and sometimes technology malfunctions occur, so no one could really take the blame. With time anything can malfunction, but if an accident that involves death is to occur how would the problem be managed if there is only a car, technology, to blame and take resposibility.

Most importantly, driverless cars shouldn't be on the road beacuse there will be too many expenses. If there would be driverless cars in the future, how much would you be charged for being taken somewhere by such a car. In today's world there is almost always a cost in order to get any type of service, the drverless car would, most likely, have a cost in order to be used, and at first that wouldn't be cheap. A driverless car would steal chaufers jobs, and sometimes those jobs are all that sustain some people, so this car would make many not have a way to get paid. At first when this cars are being constructed, how will they be paid for, each city would probably have to spend a vast amount of money to get this cars so they can start operating.

In conclusion, Driverless cars shouldn't be on the road. If these cars were on the road there will be too many expenses, how would law apply to them, and they won't be able to operate correctly if there is a problem on the road. There will be many problems with these cars, and conflicts will be harder to slove with them. If they are released into the market, a person should first think of all the things and conflicts that may arise just because of one car before using it.",5,2.0,,,,,"Based on the provided rubrics and the student's essay, here is the assessment for each criterion:

111b844,"More companies are pouring in more and more money trying to make the perfect driveless cars but pursuing the driveless car is a negative thing for car manufacturing should not be pursued. Developing driveless cars could make driving easier but is a neagtive thing becuase there is a big safety concern, it can make driving boring, and it still requires the assitance of the driver.

Driveless cars have huge and complicated safety risk. Driveless cars are not perfectly save and can cause major problems when driving in places with construction or complicated traffics or complicated driving routes and if the driver does not take control of the car, the driver and the passengers in the cars and other people can get seriously injured. Driveless cars are so doubted for their safety that certain states have limited the use or banned them from being driven or tested in their state roads, a few states who have done this is Calforina, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Driveless cars who notify people when to take over if the emergency are still not that safe as they have no effective to notify the driver that he should take over, many companies have tried different techniques but none of them have found an effective way to get the drivers attention in case the drivers needs to take over because the car cant handle the roads or sencario it is in. Without an effective way to get the drivers attention, to take over if the time is needed, the car can have an major accident because the driver attention was caught to take over the car and the car couldn't handle the situation, leading to an accident. Even with accidents the problems do not end their, many people and car manducatures and companies do not know if you blame the driver or the manfucaturing. With this not settled out, you getting in an accident because techonolgy an compnay has put in a car was incapable of handling safe driving could make you be blamed for the accident and making you pay alot of money to fix your car and damages while the company who put this faulty techonolgy in the car, walk away with no problems. Driveless cars are dangerous and can be hazardous to the driver and the people around the driver and also leave you to deal with the consequences of an accident.

Driveless may seem cool at first, being able to drive all by thereself and not needing the help of any real person but what does that do to the driver. With driveless cars it makes driving cars for the driver boring. Driving without driveless cars was a joy and something people love to do but with driveless cars it ruins the experinece as you do not get to control the car anymore and just have to watch it drive itself. This has been a big problem for car companies as they have to get people to buy their car and enjoy the ride and the car and companies do not know how to do that. Werner Huber who is the BMW project manger said that with cars being able to drive by themselves they have to find new ways to attract and make the costumers enjoy the car and they can not find a way to do that without putting the driver adn the passengers at risk. The only things they have founded to make the car enjoyable to drive with driveless cars is entrainment systems or texting but all these may be enjoyable to the driver but also puts the driver at risk.

Driveless cars are cars that are suppose to be able to drive by themselves with nobodies assitance but that is not true. These so called driveless cars are not driveless car but are cars that can do basic functions of driving but when anything hard pops up, the driver has to drive the driveless car. This is a real problem becasue having a driveless car should mean that the car should be able to drive without the help of the driver but they can not and make the driver just sit there in the driver seat, staring out the window waiting and getting bored, so they can drive the driveless car when it is in a hard driving condition and if they do not do that they are in risk of a harazardous accident. One of the most technonlgical advances car made by BMW, is a driveless car and is suppose to be driveless car but is it really, the car can only handles speeds up to 25 miles per hour and any faster and the driver has to take over and even when the car is driving itself the driver needs to keep his or her hands on the steering wheel. These self proclaimed driveless cars may look like driveless car but they are not, they require as much assiatant from a real person as non-driveless cars do.

Companies all over the world are spending money to make the best driveless car out there but is it really worth it. Driveless cars are not a positive aspect to the automotive industry but is a negative aspect of the industry. These so called driveless cars need the assistance of real life human drivers as much or even sometimes more then regular non-driveless cars, these driveless car also are extremely boring to drive and ride for the driver adn companies can't find a way to fix it, and last but not least these driveless cars are hazardous. These cars can cause accidents, can not deal with hard driving, and can leave you with the consequnces of a horrible accident. Driveless cars might sound amazing and awesome part of the future but it is an negative aspect of the automotive industry and letting that negative aspect get s foothold in the future will be disatorous.

11428cc,"Although the year is 2016 and we were promised hoverboards, flying cars, automatic tieing shoes, and self fitting jackets by 2015, we arent exactly falling behind in the race of technology. With driverless cars we are one step closer to a much safer, and easier driving experience. In the not to distant future we wont have to make dad stay awake the whole drive to Disney world just to make it there on time. We no longer will have to hop in our vehicles when we are moving and have to go back and forth and back and forth from our old home to the new. Instead all that will be required of us is to pack the car full of items and ship out the car and have someone ready to unload it.

And watch out BP! With the new driverless cars we will being making half as many stops for gas than we have ever had to before! Last, but most definatly not least important is your safety. In the new smart driverless cars accedents are surely to drop a hefty percent. Keep your eyes on the horrizon, or close them and take a nap while the the car takes the wheel.

Everyone can relate to those long hauls to out of state, whether it be for vacation, visiting relatives, or work. The most memorable part, for myself at least, was wondering where we were going to stop and sleep, or if dad was going to just keep on driving. That will be something of the past in the not so distant future. As of now the cars we have can drive on there own.. Most of the time. There are still some trouble spots such as traffic jams, work zones, and accidents. In the previously stated mishaps the current versions of the cars will promptly alert the driver that there may be an upcoming event in which they will have to intervene.

Gas in the surrounding area currently is sitting around $2.75. From what I know the average car can hold somewhere around 30 gallons of gas. Lets say you fill up your tank and ride until its empty and then fill it up again, and lets also say that it takes you about a week to empty your tank. So on monday you fill it up for around $82.50. Come next weeks monday you need to fill up for another $82.50. In a span of two weeks you have spent $165.00. There are about 4 weeks in a month so that will be $330.00 a month. But you dont just drive your car for a month, so for a year you will be paying roughly $3960 a year! In the new driverless cars they can take that almost $4000 and cut it down to around $2000 since with the technology in the new cars you will be stopping in at a gas station about half as many times as you would be if you were driving in one of the old cars.

The complany Google has sent out a fleet of driverless cars already (with drivers in them ready to take the wheel at any given moment.) to help further the progress towards these great machines. They have driven around half a million miles (500,000 miles!) and are yet to crash. Google´s Toyota Prius is modified with position-estimating sensores on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. With this massive combonation of the latest technology we can say goodbye to blindspots for good!

Safety, luxery, money. All three of those are what the new smart driverless cars are offereing. It is almost our duty to open our arms to the advance of this technology. With Google at the helm of the team that will bring us the cars we need and deserve, they will be in the news quite soon.",5,2.5,,,":**

120cb91,"I believe that the negative aspects of driverless cars outweigh the positive ones. There are too many complications and problems that are yet to be solved. Driverless cars are a very unique and interesting invention, but I am not in favor of the development of these cars. There is a vast number of improvements that still need to be made in order for these cars to function properly.

Driverless cars have too much technology involved that could easily malfunction and lead to several mishaps. Looking at paragraph 4 it states that,""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" From this quote, you can already see how complex a driverless car needs to be in order to run efficiently. All of these gadgets have to installed and all of them are very necessary. According to the author in paragraph 4, it also claims, ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" If the LIDAR malfunctions, then the car has no information on its surroundings. It would be virtually impossible for a driverless car to work without the perfect execution of all these devices. I believe that there is too much room for error.

I also am against driverless cars because there is a lack of safety when a driver is not in control of a car. Many states agree with this and do not allow for driverless cars to occupy their roads. In paragraph 9 it explains how,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" This quote tells you that the traffic laws of numerous states would need to be altered for driverless cars to be allowed. The majority of states believe that they are not safe and restrict their use. Traffic laws as well as liability laws would need to be redone in order to cover the safety. At the end of paragraph 9 it asks,""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" This directly correlates to a lack of safety and major complications. In case of an accident, the victim would not know who to blame and in the end would severely suffer. There are way too much obstacles that obstruct the safety of too many citizens with driverless cars.

Lastly, driverless cars are not fully capable of running independently. With this, you would need to figure out an effective way to alert your driver when their assistance is needed. If the driver could not be alerted, then this could lead to massive consequences. In paragraph 7 it states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This quote highlights the neccesity of getting the driver's attention. If in any case the driver was not able to be alerted, the repercussions would be severe.

In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

12a1427,"That photo is not an alien. What photo am I talking about? The photo the NASA took of the ""face""that is shown in a lot of places. In the arcticle its says,""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" Lots of people believe it is an alien, but it is not. It is not an alien because it is just a natural land form, it is hard to target(because it never moves, small and blends in with all the rest of noraml mars), and people say it looks like a normal natural lava dome (and it does).

It is just a natural land from. It is only shaped like a face. There is nothing odd or strang about it besides the shaping. It just happened to look like a face. In the texts it says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows it had nothing to so with aliens, it was just a land form.

If it was a living thing, or used to be living shouldn't move around?Its not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin. This shows it is one spot and small. It also proves it blends in like in other natural land form would do. If it was something special you would think it would be easier to find. If you don't look very closly you don't even see the face at all.

Not only is it natural land, but it is also reminds Garvin of a lava dome of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This again proves if you ignore the fact that it looks like a face, it looks completely normal. It looks like a normal thing any planet would have, even earth.

Some may agrue it looks to much like a face to not be something like an alien. Even though it is funny how much it looks like face, there are too many facts proving it isn't anything different from everything else on the planet mars. It just happened to be the way it formed it looked like a face.

There are many things proving, this thing on Mars is not an alien or created by aliens. First, it is just like anyother land form, just a ""werid"" shaping. Second, it blends in, is small and doesn't move. (This makes it hard to target.) Finally, it reminds people of a lava dome, again showing it is just shaped weird to us. The face got the attention of the public for a while, like the text said,""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" But, everyone needs to let it go because it is nothing to talk about since we now know the truth. It was fun for a while, but if you still believe it more than a normal part of mar's natural land, you will look like a fool. I guess we will have to keep looking on other planents to find live or ""aliens"" because so far it is for sure not on mars!",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

131a75b,"Many people believe technology is becoming too advanced for our own good. Maybe they were right, technology is advancing at a rapid rate and can also invade one's privacy. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions such as happy, sad, disgust, surprised, and a few other basic emotions. There is debate whether this software should become avaible in classrooms for students and if it is valuable. It is not very valuable, it is an invasion of privacy to use this software to read a students' emotional responses to their work.

Schools around the world are becoming more and more advanced everyday. Students, freshman through seniors, at Floyd Central High School along with hundreds of tother high schools have ipads that students carry around and use in their everyday classes. If they were to have this new software it would not change very many things. ""For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different."" What does web ads have to do with a student's education? This only shows that students will be recorded at all times through their ipads and/or computers while they do their school work. This is a huge invasion of privacy to students everywhere who might have to use this new emotional expression software.

The article states, "" ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huang predicts.""Then it could modify the lesson, like the effective human instructor."" "" Though it sounds like a step towards the right direction in technology, students will be just as bored doing random classwork on a computer without emotion software watching their every move through a camera. Also, at least 60% of students do better with a teacher in front of them to help rather than learning things online. If this software acts as a effective human instructor, students will still grow confused because as the article states that ""...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."". A student will most likely do better just having a teacher because of the facial expressions or body language a teacher gives while teaching can help them better retain the information given rather than a screen teaching it to them, and if a teacher is doing a lecture in front of a class there is no need for a student to have out a laptop computer or an ipad unless it is called for that class and the teacher would be able to answer questions, not the computer.

The Facial Action Coding System software should not be used in the classroom. It is not of value to a student's education, it would be a waste of money and time to install it onto student ipads or computers. It is a complete invasion of privacy to today's youth to be constantly looked at through a little camera just to see if they are confused or not when they could just simply raise their hand and ask a teacher. Though it has many benefits, it has more pros than cons. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is supposed to convince the audience reading it that Facial Action Coding System software should be put in schools, reading it would make one feel the opposite.

13f75ec,"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College was created many, many years ago in the Constitution by our founding fathers, and now it is finally its time to retire. The Electoral College should be taken away and replaced by election by popular vote, in order to determine the president of the United States. The Electoral college should be abolished, because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are not treated fairly in this process. The United States strives to be a place of freedom and equality, but we as a country can not achieve this goals with this proccess in place.

The United States of America, is all about people protecting their rights, but how can that be if citizens are not even allowed to represent themselves with thier own votes. According to the Office of the Federal Register's article,""What is the Electoral College?,""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" Which means that our votes just choose people to represent our state and vote for us. So whats the whole point of voting in the first place? Is it just to make citizens feel like they are actually choosing the president. This proccess would not be a problem if the electors actually represented us correctly. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer, ""in 2000...Al Gore... won the popular vote but lost the presidencey,"" because of the electoral college. Plumer went on to quote a Gallop poll recorded after Al Gore lost which reported,"" over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to kind we have now."" Thats over half of the people voting! But the incident with Al Gore was not the only one, also according to Bradford Plumer's article,"" in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" In other words, they were trying to cheat and make sure the out come of the vote was what they wanted. People may argue that there have only been few instances of the Electoral College making mistakes, but how many more mistakes are they going to make in the future. Will there be so many, that our entire political system becomes corrupt. The citizens of the United States should be allowed to represent themselves with their own vote, and choose their own leaders.

How can the U.S. strive for equality, if states are not treated fairly through the process of the electoral college? The Electoral College process, is a winner-takes-all system, because of this, candidates spend their time only focused on specific states. States that are most populated, or that they think will be a ""swing"" state, basically any state that has a specific insterest to them and that will help their campaign. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" written by Bradford Plumer,""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This is a result of the faulty system, how are people suppossed to know who they want to vote for, if candidates won't even take the time to make a pitch to them? If the United States really wants equality, they need to start by having a equal state voting process.

At the end of it all, the Electoral College should be abolished because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are treated unfairly in the process. Help the United States continue to reach its goal of freedom and equality by abolishing the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

United States Citizen.    ",5,3.0,,,":**

14a1792,"Many people believe that there should be technology in a classroom, but do we really need technology that reads emotions. The Facial Action Coding System is the system that was designed by scientists to read emotions. They believe that teachers could use this system for lessons online. Even though it could help teachers, it shouldn't be used in a class. This technology could have many flaws that would produce false readings. Especially when reading kids emotions. This technology does help in many ways, but there are some things that humans have to do by them selves.

Teachers need to stop relying on technology to teach. A teacher should be required to take classes that can help them become a better teacher and to help them with reading emotions. Instead of them using the Facial Action Coding System to find out kids emotions they should take a psychology class. That class will teach them what they need to know about humans. Especially humans going through adolesence. Once those teachers understand how emotions work they wont have to rely on a technology that isn't flawless.

The Facial Action Coding System has so many flaws in it that prevent it from being useful. The article states that this technology can recognize when a student is confused or bored. The problem with that is the fact that a person can fake emotions. If the students wanted to try to be funny they could mess with the system and change something that was working. In the article, Dr. Huang said, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective teacher."" An effective teacher wouldn't change something just because a couple people ar bored or confused. This system also doesn't factor in the chances of someone having a bad day. If someone is having a bad day confused emotions could already be happening before the lesson. This would mess everything up.

I understand that some people aren't natural psychologists, and don't know how to read emotions. These people can just take there time and teach themselves how to read them. Even though not all teachers have the knowledge learned through psychology, they all should. People naturally believe that technology can help. It can help, and thats why it is understandable to want the Facial Action Coding System to be used by school. There are better alternatives to this system. The author stated, ""we can write down simple instructions the ""encode"" different emotions."" If people can do that then, why aren't they doing it?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should not be used in school. It has no value to learning. The better alternative is to make teachers do things themselves. Teachers should learn how to read emotions. They also need to learn that you can't always rely on a system that is not flawless. A teachers job is to teach and not to sit and let technology run their classroom. So if schools want a type of technology that isn't valuable, they can use it all they want, but if they want something that has value they should teach their teachers how to read emotions.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

14d1bfc,"So the other day I was working at NASA just like everyday and something was brought up that I had never heard before. What was brought up was that back in the 70's, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a top region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The person who said this out loud said it was just formations called butte or mesa's which are very common around the American West. What happened was pretty normal at NASA. One of my co workers blurted out it was probably created by aliens. More people started agreeing with him because how else could a human looking face get on a planet that nobody ever talked about. It started to have me thinking about space and all the crazy things that happen, so I decided to do some research when I got home. I looked around the internet, and went to the public library to look for some books about rock formatons on different planets. Once I got those, I finally began research and what I found was shocking. I believe that the face on Mars is not and ancient alein artifact because rock formations form on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed.

I believe that the face found on Mars is not an ancient alien artifact because rock formations form on every planet. research has shown that the face found on Mars looksv like lanforms common around the American West. As far as people know, that face could have just gotten there from some sort of sand storm on the big red planet back in the 70's. Another thing that people shold know is that pictures can be deceving.

I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact because pictures can be deciving. What scientist knew back then, and what they know now is a lot different. There is much more technological advances now then there were back then, so the picture quality from space wasn't very good. It was very pixelated, not clear, and didn't give very much information. It is understandable that people thought it was an alien head but thats just not the truth. The picture quality now is at the highest its ever been so people can see pictures a lot more clearly. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That proves that the image was very deceving and not many people could figure out what it most likely looked like. One more thing that people should really know is that there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.

I believe that the face on Mars was not an anciet alien artifact because there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed. Back in the 70's people thought that aliens were real because the technology wasn't very good, and people olny believed what they were told. In the latest years though, Scientists have no evidence that aliens are real. This proves that there couldn't have been an anciet cicilization of aliens.

Because of these facts, I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact becaue rock formations can be found on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

14e0d1b,"Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in. Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school. To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one. The use of reading a students emotions is valuable in many ways like helping with possible depression, enhancing the material, and creating a better enviroment.

School can be a stressful time for many students and also a time of growth. Especially in high school and even middle school, the childs body is going through puberty. This chemical change in the body can lead to mood swings and other issues especially when school stress is added on top. This technology is capable of indicating ""...the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(paragraph 7). With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion.

Also, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases. However with the aid of this technology ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (paragraph 6). If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well. For difficult classes being able to know when the students are lost would help significantly in increasing the understanding of the material as teachers will be able to know exactly what the students dont understand, and thus be able to help them achieve better grades.

Being able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall. SInce the technology would be able to understand the basic emotions like ""...happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" (paragraph 3), this can give a school tons of feedback on how to improve. For example, with negative emotions, a school would be able to improve its cafeteria food quality from knowing what foods are highly unpopular, and as a result save food from wasting. Or during school events, even though the event might be a success knowing how each of the students felt about the event would help with improving it for next year. The addition of this technology would allow a school to be the best the possibly could.

The addition of this facial technology can be quite revolutionary in a school setting. As students often dont share their true feelings, issues can be confronted and the students mentality can be improved. Also a better, and positive learning enviroment can be created. The ability to remove student confusion and make learning interesting would go a long way in helping not only the students grow and move forward positivly, but also the school as a whole.",5,3.0,,,,,"Based on the provided essay and the rubrics, here is the evaluation for each criterion:

1549de8,"Senator of the State of Florida,

The Electoral College has been a part of our country since is was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers. Although it has been used for so long and some what effectivley, I believe that the act of changing the process to election by popular vote would benefiet the country and the residents more. Many poeple do think that the Electoral College is more fair and is better because of its certain outcome and other good aspects. My belief about the Elecotral College differs. I believe it is unfair and outdated, and I am not alone on that opinion.

An argument against the Electoral college is the disaster factor, information from the passage

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. In 2000, the biggest election crisis took place in a century. In 1960, segregationists almost had success in replacing electors with people who would benefiet them. Along with that, some electors may not be truthful and defy those who they are electing for and elect the opposer. All these examples come with fault in the system.

Another example from the same article claims that the idea of a tie is the most unsettling. The election would be put into the hands of the House of Representatives. An argument for the Electoral College claims the chance of a tie is very unlikely, but it has come close before. In 1968 and in 1976, a small shift would've cost the election. On the other hand, it would be much more difficult to tie a popular vote, seeing that there are far more citizens than electors for the college.

There are claims that the Electoral College is both fair and unfair for different reasons. People claim that it is fair because no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, when a popular vote might, from the article

In Defense of the the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. However, the process is unfair as well. In result of a winner-take-all system in the states, the presidental candidates don't spend time in states they know they don't have a chance in. This is unfair to voters because not all states get to see the candidates at all. Swing states have all the focus on them. These states are more likely to pay attention to campaigns. This is not fair because those running for the position will focus more on those states. With a popular vote, the candidates will want to contact each state to make sure those who reside there have paid attention to them and will hopefully vote for those people.

The process of the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and risky. There are so many opportuntities for disaster and a lot of unfairness all around. With people relying on the fact that the chances are slim or disaster is unlikely to happen is just not smart and there are things we can do about it. With a popular vote, a fair count is given and the president who more people choose will take office. Our country is a whole, and we treat the process of election like it isn't. Let the population decide and it's a fair trial; let a few electors decide and it could lead to disaster. Thank you.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

15b1360,"Can you imagine a time in the future when no one will have any money because of ""Driverless Cars"". Yes, you may think driverless cars is a good idea but its not. We already have ""Driverless Cars"", they are taxis and buses. They say it would use half the fuel of today's taxis and are more flexible than a bus. But how much would they cost? Are they going to be cheaper than a taxi? Are they going to be bigger than a bus?

Buses and taxis are probaly the cheapest forms of transport, and don't get me started on Ubers.

They say that Google has already made some ""Driverless Cars"", but they are not really driverless. Driverless means no one behind the wheel. ""They alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If it can't drive through traffic or back out of driveways then what's the point. What's the point of having a ""Driverless Car"" if it's not really driverless. Isn't the whole point of having a driverless car to relax and let it drive on it's own, not to be alerted when it can't even pull up into your driveway.

""Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads."" So what you're telling me is that you want to make the roads smarter too? No, you need to make humans smarter not cars or roads. If we weren't so lazy we wouldn't need ""Driverless Cars"". ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" Want if the ""human at the wheel"" sucks at driving?

Then we are going to have some issues.

The sensors are what the should be adding to cars. The sensors ""Can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better respone and control than a human driver could manage alone.""

See that is what we need in cars, they are so many car accidents because of speeding and drunk driving.

Ok back to why ""Driverless Cars"" souldn""t be made. Driverless cabs? They already driverless cabs, you, yourself are not driving the cab. Unless you are a cab driver you are not driving the cab, and it's going to take so many jobs away from cab drivers. ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to driver?"" Their turn to drive? So you take turns driving your brand new driverless car? But don't worry they have a in-car-entertaimnet and information system to make sure you don't fall asleep at the wheel. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"" I thought it was a driverless car why would the driver be at fault?

I can talk about this ""Driverless Cars"" idea for hours but I only have fifty-five minutes to talk about this. So i'm just going to wrap this up with my last thought. Driverless cars sould not be made.

This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world. The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it would allow teachers to know when students become confused, are being dishonest, or are depressed and possibly having problems at home.

In the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson. It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material. Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" (D'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student.

School behavior is a big part of a students education. If a student is constantly acting out and misbehaving it could affect his or her education pretty badly. Although, that is why Facial Action Coding Systems could also be very useful in a classroom environment. The technology could be able to detect if a student is being dishonest, which could prove very handy when dealing with situations with delinquents and trouble-makers. In the excerpt, the author writes, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,"" (D'Alto). In this quote, the author tells the reader about some facial muscle clues that allow experts to tell if a famous figure is being dishonest. These are some of the same facial clues the FACS looks for.

Finally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home. The machine can detect six different emotions, including sadness. This could prove useful when dealing with distressed students. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D'Alto). This quotes tells the reader about the emotions the machine can read.

The use of the FACS to read the emotional ",5,3.5,,,,,"Based on the student's essay, here is the evaluation for each rubric criterion:

1608b25,"The Face On Mars

Have you ever seen something crazy on something, maybe a face or something that you seen before? Have you thought about how that face or something else has gotten there? Well, for a start it defintley wasn't aliens! Just like the face on mars, people belive that the face was created by aliens! But that isn't true, the face on mars is just and only a natural landform that some how was created on earth.

For my first reason on why the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because NASA later revelied that the face was not made of aliens, but by shadows. A few days after that image was found, NASA needed to take a look and figure out what made this incredible and scientififc picture so unique, and why and how it was formed. Later on, they have came up with an good explaination about this unique image. NASA said this,""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Scientifically, the face was made from a natural cause, so it makes it a very different natural landform.

Now, for my second reason on why this was not made by aliens, but just a natural landform is that there is no scientific research showing that aliens do exist and created this face. Now I do know that some people say that they have seen aliens, but scientists dont think that is one hundred percent true because they don't have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real. Many people to belive in them, but how do we know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge? But now after NASA did some research, they found out that even though we don't have information about them, aliens did not create that face, it was only a natural landform.

For my third and final reason, why the face was not created by aliens and is only a natural landform , is because in the last paragraph,paragraph twelve, they talk about how the the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. Since the landform shows a butte or mesa, that means that the image was a major landform that came from the American West. Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He also said,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, this is not only a natural landform, but a major natural landform.

I do agree a little bit about aliens creating the face. Maybesomewhere in space, there are aliens that created something else or not. One day maybe we can find something out in space that has something to do with aliens, but today is just isn't the day to do that. But overall, i would have to agree that aliens did not create this, but this is only a natural landform created by something other than aliens.

As you can see, this creative landform was most defintley not created from aliens, but just a nice natural landform. Scientists now figured out that this ""Face on Mars"" is from shadows and not from aliens. This landform is actually a butte or a mesa which is very intersting to have found out. Many people did belive that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, but scientists haven't found out if there are aliens or not, so we shouldn't jump into conclusion. But overall, this face was defintely a landform and not created by aliens!!",5,3.0,3.0,,":

165914d,"Venus is a interesting but amazing planet. It has a nickname of the ""Evening Star"". It is the planet that is the closest related to earth, which makes sense for it also being referred to as Earth's ""twin."" It being so closely related to our home planet has caught the eye of some. It is a planet no one can get close to however some think it is worth some risks to discover what lies there. You may be thinking what risks are there? Well there are quite a few. The author does a great job explaining what the risks are and how harsh Venus can be. However I do not believe they explained enough of the benefits that support why we should explore it despite the risk factor involved.

For Venus being Earth's ""twin"" it's very different from earth. The author included the facts of the atmosphere of Venus is made up of almost ninty-seven percent of carbon dioxide and it's clouds have highly corrosive sulferic acid in them. Earth does not have either of those and humans breathe oxygen and in return produces carbon dioxide. Humans really couldn't benefit from the lack of oxygen compared to the almost ninty-seven percent carbon dioxide. The almost other three percent may not even be oxygen but the author doesn't include that detail. Earth doesn't have an average of over 800 degress on its surface unlike Venus. The author then included that the pressure is 90 times greater on Venus then it is on Earth, that pressure can crush a submarine.

There is even more that prevent us from discovering more on Venus. The weather there can and will include erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning storms. Which is really not ideal at all for trying to explore.

NASA is working on ways to get up close with Venus. According to the passage they have been testing different electronics made of silicon carbide in chambers simulating the conditions on Venus. They discovered it could last up to three wees. Their other idea was to have scientists float above the fray. But they couldn't take rocks samples or anything by doing so. It would be a good way, but they really couldn't get the research they wanted. As well as the fact it wouldn't be easy conditions because of the radiation.

According to the author, Astromers are very interested in Venus because at one point they believe it was ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" They believe it was covered with oceans and even sustained life just like Earth does now. In current day they know that it still does have similarities to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. But is that really all worth it?

The author then says the value of returning there is indisputable. The author really included a lot more risks than benefits of returning there. The support they gave wasn't that supportive. Then would say something beneficial for example, they could actually observe from the fray but they only have limited sight of the planet. It really just adds to the negative part of the exploration. The article seemed to have more negativity than positivity. The risks drowned out the support which in turn made the author's point not as strong.             ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

1750767,"Dear senator

The Electoral College should be kept for the voting of the President. There are many reasons to support this conclusion. When the people vote for a President, they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This can be a good and bad thing. The good thing is that the Electoral College keeps balance. The bad part is that some Americans see that is unfair that they cannot vote for a President directly.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the politicial balance between small and large states (as it says in paragraph 21). This means that it makes sure the election is fair, not one person can be voted president just because they campaigned in a larger state (more people). The Electoral College also balances out the winners. They are the people who pick the clear winner when two candidates get tied. This happened to Nixon and Clinton. They both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes (as it says in paragraph 22). In these kind of situations it is good to have a backup plan (also known as the Electoral College).

Although the Electoral College is a helpful and fair way to vote, some Americans do not see it that way. In fact,over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now (as it says in paragraph 9). There reasoning is that they cannot vote directly. They vote for a slate of electors who then vote for the president. They see this as unfair and think that they should be able to vote for the president directly. Below the 14th paragraph, it  says ""lost the presidency: In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more indivisual votes than George W. Bush nationwide,but Bush won the election,recieving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266.""

Although this may seem unfair, the reality of it is that the Electoral College is just trying to keep the election for President fair. The Electoral College help to ensure that all of the candidates for President have a fair advantage. If the Electoral College wasnt there to balance out the votings, then the candidates could cheat. By cheat, this means that they could campaign in a bigger place of they could be from a different place than another president and have a unfair advantage because of the bigger population. If one president was from Texas and the other was from Florida, the candidate from Texas would have a unfair advantage because hes from a place with a bigger population. Why this is unfair is because if a candidate is from a area with a big population, the people in that area are most likely going to vote more towards that candidates side. In the last sentence of paragraph 21, it says ""Alarge state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states.""

In the end, there are always going to be downfalls. The Electoral College may pick the opposite candidate that the majority of the people want, this is true. Also, the people may feel that it is wrong to not go with the peoples opinion. If the Electoral College was not there to decide, there would be all forms of chaos. As it says 18-22, the candidates would have an unfair advantage. The situations on both ends have cons but the Electoral College staying solves more problems than creating them.                    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

175775c,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author argues the point that exploring Venus is worth the effort and risks exhibited. The author claims that, despite the harsh conditions and deadly atmosphere, this planet is worth travelling to and observing, due to its being the ""nearest option for a planetary visit"". While the author does list a few good reasons for Venus exploration, it is my belief that they also include many reasons not to explore this dangerous planet. This inclusion of the ""cons"" of exploration hurts the thesis more than it helps it, and damages the authors argument.

From the beginning of their argument, the author states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing [on Venus] for more than a few hours"" and that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"". The usage of these statements creates a negative image, which can lead readers to believe that the exploration of Venus is too dangerous to enagage in. Furthermore, the author uses facts intended to continue to convince readers that Venus is dangerous, when this is exactly the opposite of what the author is arguing for. Making statements which invoke fear or apprehension only pushes the reader away from the topic, instead of influencing him or her to gain interest in it. For instance, when the author uses phrases with negative connotations, such as ""thick atmosphere"", ""corosive sulfuric acid"", ""800 degrees Fahrenheit"", and ""extreme"", they influence readers negatively as well.

Similarly, the author provides little reasoning behind the belief that humanity should explore the planet Venus. Despite claiming that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"", there is little evidence given that exploring and observing Venus would be of much benefit. In fact, the author seems to have found more evidence against Venus exploration, as the prior paragraph (which listed reasons that Venus was dangerous) was much more explicit and detailed than paragraph 3. The negatives of exploring Venus (such as death and wasted money or time) seem to far outweigh the positives.

As the author continues with their argument, readers become increasingly aware that Venus is likely not as beneficial as the author intends to make it seem. With an unlivable biome and dangerous atmospheric conditions, Venus is likely far too hazardous to explore at this time in history, and I believe that the author of this article unwittingly proved so. For these reasons, I believe that the author of this article failed to support their thesis with thorough evidence or detail.       ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

178f445,"In the 21st century there has

been a lot of new technology invented. Driverless cars is among the many invention ideas that is still on the drawing board. Driverless cars should not be developed because it will cost a lot of money, traffic laws will have to be modified, and the cars won't be truely driverless.

The amount of money it will cost to make a mass oroduction of driverless cars is not worth it. The passage says ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sennsors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor."" All of the items that the Toyota Prius has on it will be needed for the new driverless cars. The things mentioned in the quote do not include the many internal modifications that will need to be made. The car companies that create cars will need to pay to have thier workers trained to be able to do the modificatins that the driverless car needs. The car company will also have to pay for all of the expensive sensors that are needed. This wil drive up the over all cost of the smart car, and make it too expensive for the average working person.

The driving laws that exist as of today focus on keeping all citizens safe, and lawmakers assume that the onlt safe cars have an alert human driver. The passage says ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safecar has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" In the US the laws state that it is illegal in many states . The laws in those states would have to be changed to allow driverless cars to enter into that state. The traffic laws that those states have were created to try and keep all members of society safe. The assumption of the states with these laws are that the only safe car is a car being driven by an alert human. Sincethis is that case the laws that were created most likely would not be changed to allow driverless cars to drive on the roads of those states.

The cars would not be able to be completly driverless. The passage says ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The cars that have been invented and tested so far are unable to be completly driverless. The cars lack skills that only humans are able to accomplish. These skills include navigating through work zones and accidents, which are two very common things on today's roads.

Since the cars are not completly driverless a human driver will have to be alert at all times in case the car isn't able to preform a human driving skill that is needed.

The overall cost, law changes, and driving assistance that will be needed to operate a driverless car is not worth it.

Conspiracy theorists belive that the Face on Mars is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, however this theory is false (paragraph 5). The Face on Mars is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa (paragraph 12). This can be proven by understanding that Martian mesas are common (paragraph 2); realizing that in the 2001 photo if something was near the Face, NASA would have been able to see it

(paragraph 11); and acknowledging the fact that the Face on Mars resembles natural structures on Earth (paragraph 12).

First, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because Martian mesas are common. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh,"" (paragraph 2). The fact that Martian mesas are common makes the idea of the face on Mars being a natural martian Mesa more logical. This is because there are more natural landforms called Martian Mesas on Mars than just the Face.

In addition, the Face on Mars in a natural landform because in the 2001 NASA photo, if there was Martian life people would have been able to see it (paragraph 11). ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" (paragraph 11). ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" (paragraph 11). This means that no matter what was near the Face on Mars during the photo, people would have been able to see what it was.

Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West,"" (paragraph 12). The Face on Mars is quite similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho (paragraph 12). The fact the Face on Mars is resemblant to natural landforms on Earth makes it more understandable that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. This is because this lets people know that these types of natural landforms are possible, and that they are even common.

Conspiracy theorists may say that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars , and that NASA would rather hide this evidence (paragraph 5). However, in the 2001 photo of the Face there was no other evidence of life on Mars (paragraph 11). Also, the Face is considered a mesa which are very common on Mars (paragraph 3).Therefore these peoples' theories are not true.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is definitely a natural landform. This is because it is considered a Martian mesa which are common around Cydonia (2). Also, the Face on Mars can be justified as a natural landform because if their was any Martian life located near the Face on Mars during the 2001 NASA photo, people would have been able to see it and tell what it was. Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth.  ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

1911daf,"Cars have always been apart of American culture. From the ""...birth place of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""'Mustang Sally'""(The End of Car Culture, Rosenthal) Cars and automobils have impacted our everyday lifes from going to the store to hanging out with friends, but car usage has been stedily decreesing and for all the right reasons.

A new movemnent is trending everywhere, it's called ""smart planning"". It's simple, separate subarban life from auto use. In doing so this movement is going to help out the econdomy and also the enviorment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 perecent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" [empheses on original] That many emissions are horrible for the enviorment and even worse for our pockets, because they're just going up in smoke. New cities are rising and are acctuly trying to adopt this trend by making cities denser, which means that all the stores and your work place are in walking distance. By being able to walk to your local shopping store or favorite move theatre means that you're saving gas, and by saving gas the ecodimey is saving money which will make prices in all the stores and other bussnesses cheaper for the consumer, you!

The infamous smog is not only in Bejing, or the United States, but also in The City of Love. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London..."" (Paragraph 17, Duffer) The city is not so lovely as you'd think it would be, but the trend has cought on in Paris! Not only that but it also has been great for the enviorment. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Begjing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" (Paragraph 14, Duffer)

Most people would think ""I could never do that! No one could live like that and still make a living!"" Honestly though, it's been doing the city of Bogota in Colombia, a city comprimised of 7 million citizens a favor. They held a event for only one day evey year since the mid 1990s to improve and ""...promote alternive transportation and reduce smog."" (Paragraph 21, Selsky) Doing this has sparked a revolution of change thoughout the whole city. More people are willing to walk insted of drive to help the enviorment and the place they live in, and the city is giving right back to them! ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut trafic; and new restaruants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Paragraph 28, Selsky) Just one day a week could cut down smog and other green house gasses a lot and help our enviroment and the edodomey.

Back in the 1950's people had to use cars to do eveything. From talking to a friend face to face to going to the nearest resturant. But now you can do all of that in your own living room, due to technology that has advanced us to be able to use Facetime, Skype, or Oovoo to talk to our friends face to face using out phone, tablet, or personal computer. And to drive anywhere we need to we have apps the diliver taxies to our houses for us.""...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends...Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps have facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared can services fro getting to work."" ( Paragraph 35, Rosenthal)

Working everyday will effect this because no one wants to miss work. Missing work means less money and creates more stress for the person missing work. By saving maybe $10 on gas that day you're missing out on the $125 you could've made by working, but there's another solution to this also. Car-pool! Even if you're driving the car yourself or you're in the car you're saving fule and money. Once a week you could to this to stop in increes of smog in our enviorment and even help with traffic jams. And without traffic jams eveyone is less stressed out and a lot more happier.

By not using our cars as much, we can help ourselves and everyone aroud us by making a better world that makes it better for our children, or even our childrens' children. We can save money by just taking one day off of not driving. We should limit car use so we can stop car accedents from happening, getting stressed in traffic jams, to helping out the economical heart of the United States, and just to make our world a better place to have fun and thrive in.

191623d,"Dear, State Senator

I have recently read articles about the electoral vote system currently in place in the united states.

The electoral vote system elects other people, called electors, to vote for the people.  They basically vote for president, if you and many others vote for him/her.  I believe the electoral vote system is glitchy, outdated, and confusing to some.

The electoral vote system can be manipulated and unfair.  The electors can be choosen by state conventions, state central committees, and the candidates running for president.  If the president can choose his electors, could'nt he replace the orignal electors for new ones that will guarantee a vote for him.  The peoples vote would'nt matter.  This situation happened in the two-thousand election when George W. Bush won the election with more indivisual votes than electoral votes.  This violates our constitution which states, the government is controlled by the people and allows for change if enough people in the US want it.  If you've ever noticed that during the presidential election, candidates don't come to certain states.  In the electoral system, each state has a winner-take-all system.  When the state goes over their electoral votes, the winner with the most electoral votes takes all of them, while the electoral votes of the opponent gets no votes toward him.  This can cause mayhem, the non-counted votes can make a big diffrence in the election.  In nineteen-seventy six their would have been a tie if 9,246 voters in Hawaii and Ohio voted the opposing side.  The elections come close and without the popular vote which accounts for millions of people in America, we may have had better elections with less debates.  The electoral college contains 538 electors, out of those 538 their only 270 are mandatory to vote.  Each elector equals each member in your states House Of Represenatives and add two for the senate.  California has a population of 35 million and wyoming has a population of 500,000.  Wyoming having 5 electors and california having 55.  This doese'nt make sense because if a state may have a higher population than wyoming but yet still have less electors.  The system is very confusing in these ways causing some to vote for the wrong candidate and others thinking they are voting for the right candidate they believe is true .

The electoral votes are'nt the worst because we are still showing our democracy, showing off Americas greatnest in its government.  The electoral vote crisis in two-thousand rarely happens.  This situation has'nt happened since eightteen-eighty eight, its a rare occurance.  Electoral votes also make the playing field even.  If we had popular votes in place, then wouldnt the presidents have a landslide if they went to all the biggest populated states.  The electoral votes can allow ties and close elections to happen instead of land slides in many elections.

The electoral votes should be replaced.  Even so they even out the playing field and the occurence of rigged electoral votes happen, it still doese'nt make up for the both elections lost in eightteen-eighty eight and two thousand.  If we dont change the electoral votes soon, the occurance of electoral vote sabotage will occur more often causing an unfair government to be in place.            ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

1a0971f,"A world with driverless cars would be a very simple world. With newer and more advanced technology being invented everyday, it

gets safer as well. Although driverless cars are not completely driverless yet, it's still a great start to an amazing future.

I am a new driver, meaning that I am just learning how to drive, and I have to admit; it's not as easy as it looks. I think it would be wonderful to live in a time period that has driverless cars, or at least be able to witness them being made. The majority of our cars now are already operated by computer systems, even though humans do the majority of the work required to control a car. The human kind as a whole isn't always the keenest when it comes to being aware of our surroundings, and being able to have a car that allows us to pay more attention without actually doing anything could take away a lot of the pressure for drivers, especially teen drivers.

Fuel consumption has always been, and probably always will be one of the top issues associated with cars and driving. But with the creation of these new, driverless cars, the amount of fuel consumption should go down according to Google cofounder, Sergey Brin. The health of our planet is a major concern, and having millions, maybe even billions, of cars letting out gas is not making it better. If we can create a car that requires less fuel (which means it'll produce less gas into the air), then that is one thing we can check off of the list of things destroying Earth.

Sensors and lasers are also great contributions to the completion of driverless cars. Although they would, of course, still require the driver to be on stand-by, 98% of the energy to opererate and drive the car would be done by the car itself. Technogly is continuously advancing, and at an even faster pace, it's getting hard to keep up. In no time we'll all be driving in cars that don't actually require us to drive. Sebastian Thrun seems to have the same idea, considering that in just the time frame of the 2000s, we've created GPS, computers, laptops, and touchscreen cellphones.

Paragraph eight asks us ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" I think these are great questions! I know that as a new driver, I would totally miss not being able to drive, so why not create a car that gives you the option of deciding if you want the car to drive itself, or if you want to drive! Of course no one likes traffic, and who likes 16+ hour car rides to Florida? These could be the times that the car would drive by itself.

All in all, driverless cars could be one of the many successes of man kind, but safety is still an issue. It's a great thing to be able to come up with the idea to create things such as driverless cars, but it's even better to know your'e the one who perfected the idea, and turned it into a reality. We are living in a reality of an innovative generation that's only just getting started. I can't wait to see what happens next.

For example the author of this article stated that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". This quote is showing just two examples of how unsafe Venus is. It is saying that the air is filled almost fully with carbon dioxide which is deadly to humans and the clouds are full of acid that could kill humans as well. The author also describes in the article how dangerously hot the surface of Venus is and it could simply kill someone. The author does very well at describing the dangers of exploring Venus. They give many examples as to why it is almost impossible to explore there.

The author then gives examples as to why it would be a worthy pursuit to be able to explore there. Even though the amount of dangers are huge there are many good reasons as to try and be able to explore Venus. In this passage it is said that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". This quote is showing that if they were to get someone to be able to explore Venus then we would be able to find information about the planet like this out. It would be even better if they were able to get up and personal to the planet like collect rocks, gas, or other things on the planets surface as explained in the article. It would be one great experience to find out what life on other planets would be like.

All of this imformation is showing how well the author is convaying the message of how worthy it would be to be able to explore Venus even though it has many dangers. The author is giving the readers many different examples of what the dangers are, why it would be important to explore this planet, and also how they are trying to figure out ways to do so. The author explained how NASA is trying to find many different approaches to be able to explore Venus and get information. All of this information that was explained in this article are great ways to showing how it is a worthy pursuit to exploring Venus. It makes the readers of the article get a clear picture of everything and why it would be good to try to explore this planet.

Yes, exploring Venus would be really great and it brings many dangers. As read in this article the author does a great job as to showing the readers why it would be a worthy pursuit even though it brings many dangers with it. The author included many details about what the dangers are, why it would be important to explore Venus, as well as how NASA is trying to solve this issue. ",5,3.0,,,":**

1af5f9b,"For decades humans have been fascinated by the idea of cars that do not require any human assisstance to drive. In recent years, this Science- Fiction movie staple has become les of a dream and more of a reality. Many companies are producing and testing drivelerless cars, but are they really safe? Driverless cars are unsafe because they require human attention, and because technology is unreliable. They are also impractical, and therefore, will never become a household staple.

The term ""driverless""

is not really the best word to describe these cars, because they do require an alert human driver, with their eyes on the road, and may even require the human driver to take over in certain situations, such as backing out of a driveway, or thorugh a contruction zone. This begs the question,"" What is the point?"" Why would we go through the trouble of creating these self-driving cars, if they are not completely self- driving? The truth is that no technology can replace human insticts in situations such as road-construction or traffic jams. However, if people are able to drive these cars, many wil most likely not pay attention to their surroundings. To solve this issue, many companies have invented creative ways to get the driver's attention when they need to take over. However, the only way for these cars to be completely safe is for the driver to remain alert and watching the road at all times. If a driver is already watching the road, they may as well just drive themselves!

In addition to this, there is the issue of whether these cars can truly be trusted. There are many issues with technology in our day to day lives. If a person's TV or cell phone stops working while they are using it, it is not a disasterous issue, but if their car stops accelerating and steering in the middle of the road, there may be monumental consequences! Technology can never be relied on completely, because there will always be issues and problems that may arise. Simply put, there is a reason that these cars are outlawed in almost every state!

Safety issues aside, there is also a practicality issue with these cars. Is this really something that people will use in their everyday lives? Will these cars be a practical item for common people? As discussed earlier, the driver has to keep constant attention on the road for these cars to be safe. These cars simply are not practical. For example, the BMW ""Traffic Jam Assisstant"" can only reach speeds of 25 miles per hour, and requires the driver to keep hold of the wheel. These cars also use a lot of sensors. Would they be practical and effecient to manufacture? Chances are, many people would not even be able to afford these vehicles, becuase the prices would be astonomical. These cars are not practical for everyday use by the average person. They are more fitting as a toy for a celebrity or millionaire. The self-driving car will not become a household staple for the everyday family.

Self-driving cars shoud not continue to be developed. These vehicles are unsafe and impractical. They require constant human attention and the liability issues are muddy, at best. For these reasons, self-driving cars should not continue to be developed, and will never become a common item in the United States.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

1b14997,"In this reading, the author is talking about exploring venus, but all his evidence speaks differently. I believe the author does not support the clam that Venus is a worthy pursuit because the evidence given is mediocre. He contradicts himself in many paragraphs proving why we shouldn't send people over, and has not given any reason why we should go over there.

In this short persuasive article, the author does not pursuade at all. In paragraph two, the backround of Venus is given, but it's not stated why its important to visit this planet. ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" The only valid reason givin in this short story is when it is said in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This statement gives no reason for traveling and researching Venus except for the fact it used to be like Earth.

Though it is said Earth is one of a kind, this article states Venus is the most like Earth planet they've ever found. That could be a valid reason to explore and consider inhabiting, but it is proven with evidence that Venus is inhospitable and would serve no purpose in researching and visiting. In paragraph three, it is said, ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These conditions are said to be inhospitable in paragraph four. It is also said, ""Such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and liquify."" This evidence says the planet is almost impossible to visit and collect data on, except in the fifth paragraph, it is a very long explanation as to how we could even study venus. This is then contradicted in the sixth paragraph by saying photography and videography are ineffective because of the thick atmosphere, and no samples would be possible because the ground conditions are too bad for humans, and even metal.

In conclusion, the evidence the author has given us condradicts and outweighs the evidence given for the idea Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, meaning he did not support this idea. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

1b26302,"Dear state senator,

There has been an ongoing conflict on the matter of the proper method to use when deciding on a president: use of the electoral college, or popular vote. I believe that this should be looked upon in greater concern than it currently is. Not only do many people question this arguement, but they feel uncomfortable by it too. I believe the electoral college should be taken away from the process. This is a more secure way of voting because the people of this nation feel as if whom ever they vote for may not actually be voted for by the electors. And this is, in no way, a good thing for the nation.

In the first place, the electoral college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. The electoral college has a seemingly fair way of deciding such a thing. Each state is given a certain number of electors to represent its population (Ex. A small state such as Maryland would have less electors than California). It seems alright, until you realize how unfair it really is... In one way, though rare, the electors may switch outlooks, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented.

Not only does it have the unfair use of electors, but it also is much more inprecise than popular voting methods. While the electoral college, in total, has only a couple hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whoever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In '

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electoral vote, that ""the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country.

In my final point, as not to bore you with countless others, the use of popular vote has already surpassed the electoral college votes, as such in the case of Nixon vs Kennedy, but has not proven enough to win the election. How is that fair, on any level? It shows how most people voted for one candidate, but then have that candidate lose because of the electoral college. Is that not reason enough, to show that people wanted a certain person as president, but because of the electoral college, didnt get as they wanted nor deserved? Not only is it shown in basic reasoning, but it is also shown in the numbers. The electoral college is an unjust way to elect presidents.

I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term. And i speak for most of the people in the U.S. when i say, as Bob Dole did: Abolish the electoral college!    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

Seeing something that you can't really tell what it is is frustrating, right? NASA and conspiracy theorists totally know what you are going through. NASA found a

""Face on Mars"" and now everyone thinks it has something to do with aliens. Well, they are very wrong. NASA would have benefitted from the ""Face of Mars"" if aliens had anything to do with it, NASA took a picture on April 5, 1998 snapping a higher resolution picture, and on April 8, 2001, they took a picture at the sharpest point on a cloudless summer day, proving for the second time that it was just a landform. The skeptics may have their points on to why it may be created by aliens, but NASA has three amazing photos to prove them wrong. The Face on Mars is not really a face after all.

To begin, NASA's budget would have benefitted a lot if the landform had anything to do with aliens at all, so why would they want to keep it a secret if it were true? First things first, When NASA revealed the photo of the huge landformation it became a huge hit! They were hoping to catch the attention of Mars to the public, and boy oh boy, they did just that. It starred in a Hollywood movie, appeared in magazines, books, radio talkshows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Unfortunately, the positive popularity always comes with the negative. Some conspiracy theorists thought that the Face was bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide. Defenders of NASA's budget can only wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

Secondly, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, the section on Mars where ""The Face"" lives, snapped a picture of it ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture proves again that the face is just a landform. The conspiracy theorists and people that supported their opinion were still not happy with the results. They said in paragraph 8, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" I don't know how they get these crazy assumptions, but they will just never give up! They went all the way back to take a second picture to prove they're wrong, don't you think that shows that nothing about this landform is alien infested, or was created by them?

Last, but not least, They took a second picture of ""The Face"" at the highest resolution possible to prove to the opposing side again. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, said Garvin. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin proved the correct point for everyone, hopefully having everyone believing that ""The Face"" is not a face, just a lava dome.

On the other hand, the other side had a bit of detail to help support their side as well. Their first assumption was that in the second photo, wispy clouds covered any alien like markings. To prove that wrong NASA took another photo at the highest resolution to prove that it is just a natural landform on Mars that has nothing to do with aliens. The skeptics will probably never give up on how this was made by aliens, but NASA has three extraordinary photos to prove them wrong every single time.

In conclusion, ""The Face"" is just a natural landform. NASA would have benefitted from the ""Face of Mars"" if aliens had anything to do with it, NASA took a picture on April 5, 1998 snapping a higher resolution picture, and on April 8, 2001, they took a picture at the sharpest point on a cloudless summer day, proving for the second time that it was just a landform. The skeptics can try to find every way to show that aliens had something to do with it, but they don't have three pictures of the landform itself. Real facts beat assumptions every time. Mars may be a mysterious place, but what isn't mysterious is the natural landform on Cydonia. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

1bfcf1f,"Human emotion can be expressed by many things such as body language, tone, and language. Emotion allows us to understand others and empathize easier. A software known as Facial Action Coding System has been developed to improve accuracy of calculating the emotions of others. Using this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable because humans already can ""calculate"" emotions, the classroom is not taught by a computer, and human emotions are very complex.

The first reason that the FACS is invaluable to the classroom is because there is no need to use technology to ""calculate"" emotions of a student. A classroom consists of a teacher and several students which are humans. The author stated within the article, ""humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day,"" He further on states that we can probably tell how a friend feels just by the look on their face. Since humans can already perceive and understand emotions of others, there is no need for a mode of technology to figure out when someone is bored or confused about certain subjects in a classroom. When a student is bored or confused about a certain subject, he or she could simply ask for help from a teacher or a peer. Using the FACS technology would be redundant in reading emotional expressions of students; Therefore, it is invaluable technology.

Computers are not what teach students in a classroom. The author tells the reader to imagine a classroom computer that could recognize your emotions, so it could ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" There is always a human instrcutor( the teacher) in a classroom, so there should not be a need for a modification of a lesson by a computer when the teacher can modify the lesson. Students do not need to be dependent on a computer to learn what they need to learn in a classroom, and a computer that can calculate emotion is obsolete by its uselessness in the manner of learning.

The final reason why emotion calculating technology is invaluable in a classroom is that emotion is too complex for just a classroom computer to calculate. First of all, emotion differs from person to person. In the aritcle Dr. Huang, a professor of the University of Amsterdam, said, ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,"" but he also stated, ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" If emotional expressions are all unique, it would be very difficult for computers to calculate the exact feeling a students is feeling just by their facial expression. Also, in the seventh paragraph, the author stated, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that the classroom computer would not be able to calculate like how it was used in the article.

In conclusion, the FACS is too redundant and under developed to be of any use for a classroom enviorment. It is invaluable and there are mulitple substitutes that can read emotional expressions of students in a school. In the future, with further innovations, there will be a time where classrooms use this type of technology to enhance education; but as of right now, the system is not useful for helping classrooms teach students.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

1c139c1,"In the United States of America, and all over the world, cars are used every day. People use them to get to work, to go see family, and to get simply, from A to B, but a new idea is sprouting up in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere where people are doing something unheard of.... giving up their cars. According to Source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"",  Vauban, Germany is a city that is almost completely car free. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" THis shws that living without cars is not only possible, but could have some great consequences.

Living car free could seem like something impossible, but it has great effects. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a study ervealing that passenger cars are responsible for 12 peercent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe....and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Without cars, we could lower pollution, which is a huge problem for some places. In the second article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris has to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city after days of near-record pollution. Motorist with even number liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars on day and motorists with odd numbered plates were ordered to the next day. This enforcement had positive consequences along with it. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital and the smog hanging over the city eventually cleared. This shows almost immediate benefits to the decline in driving. Can you imagine the benefits after a long term period of car-free cities? The possibillities are limitless.

Car-free periods of time don't have to be long term. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day takes place every year and it is a ""big hit"" with millions of Colombians according to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". For the third straight year, cars have been banned only excluding busses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog in the city of 7 million. Anyone who violated the rules were fined 25 dollars. For the first time ever, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined in the event. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This should show that car free periods of time are possible, not matter how long, and that they have great consequences that come along with them.

You might say that it would be extremely difficult to make America a car free country. Well, according to a report in the fourth article ""The End of Car Culture"" America may be on it's way. Research studues show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The nummber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter according to a analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. Thsi shows that there is a steady decline in driving and autiomotive transport in America. Also found in the fourth article, if the pattern persists, it will have beneficial impliactions for carbon emmisions and the enviorment. Many sociologists believe the pattern will continue. Alternate sources of transportation have popped up also. In New York, a new bike sharing program has popped up and in San Fransisco, Bay Arear Rapid Transit is another viable option of transport. With all of these options, doesn't one fit you?

In conclusion, alternate transport oppurtunities and car free periods of time are the solution. With so many ways to lower how much and how you drive. The switch to a more economic means of transport would be easier than you think. The possibillities are endless and multiple studies show that the good consequences outweigh the bad ones. One question is yet to be asked, are you ready to make the switch to the better way of tansport?                                                                                                               ",5,3.5,,,"**: The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue of car-free living and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

1c1c470,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is valuable. I believe this technology would be great to use in a classroom. It would really help the teacher with his or her lesson. Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If a simple classroom computer can determine a students' emotions, that would be a great assistance to a teacher. The teacher would then know if he should go into greater detail or if he should make his lesson plan a little more interesting.

Human Beings can be really good at hiding their emotions. With the Facial Action Coding System no one would be able to hide their true emotions. If someone was really depressed, but they portray themselves to be happy, this technology could stop that person from hurting themselves or others. If a school therapist or school social worker had this technology it would make their jobs so much easier. They could sense what the students are really feeling, rather than what the students want them to think their feeling. Also, the school therapist would know if the patient would need to be prescribed any medicine.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be a good idea is because, as stated in the article, it could reveal so much about the science of emotions. The FACS (Factial Action Coding System) could detect a false smile. If you are not feeling geniunely happy, if you are just ""putting on a happy face"" this technolgy would be able to see through what your false act. This new technology could become the next big thing. It would be able to uncover the truth about alot of people.

The last argument I am going to state on why the FACS would be valuable on detecting students emotions is that the technology could tell whether a student is telling the truth or not. The article states in paragraph 8 that usually when someone squint their eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of their eyes usually means that their not being thruthful. FACS uses muscle clues to determine whether a person if being truthful or not. This would be great in a classroom. For example, if someone is being bullied and they tell the teacher but the bully says he isn't bullying anyone, this would be great for the teacher. The teacher would know which one of her students is telling the truth.

In Conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be a superb idea. This new technology would not only be very interesting but it would also save many lives. This technology could be used in many different jobs. It could also help many people. With this technology you would no longer have to take someones word on how their feeling, even when you have a gut feeling telling you otherwise. Rather than assuming what someone is feeling you could now know for sure with the Facial Action Coding System. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

1c8d415,"In the article ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming,¨ the author talkes about positive and negative aspects of having diverless cars. Driverless cars can be very dangerous for they can only operate correctly in the right condicions. These smart cars could be putting peoples lives at risk and cause serious problems, and the only way these problems could be truly solved is with a great abundence of money. Aruguments would accure about whos fault it would be if someone were to get into an accident. Driverless Cars need to be highly improved or not put onto the roads, you should always be more safe than sorry.

Therefore, in this article it says, ¨ all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and aroung accidents¨(7). Showing how dangerous these smart cars can really be. If the car can not work properly in the condicions that are all around us, what makes them safe to have on the roads? As the cars keep devoloping the more dangerous they will become to us humans, if smart cars ever get to the point where they truly are driverless it would not be neraly as safe to be out on the roads. This is because these cars are know to have problem with changes in the road and when they notice this change they are programed to alert the human driver. Thinking of that, what if a child were to run out onto the road, how fast can this car really react, or how fast could this smart care alert the human driver? These driverless cars should be concidered hilgly dangerous to humans for they will never have the power to oberate just as a human could.

To futher explain why these cars could only hurt not help human kind, ¨Originally, many futurist believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday was not so much smarter cars as roads¨(3). This idea would help solve many problems that come along with the diverless car, but therfore would cause a great problem of its own. These smart roads would be highly expensive and the only way to pay for them would be the peoples money, and that seems almost impractical. These smart roads used electrical cables and magnets to help guide the car down the road, and with these ideas you would be putting the power into the roads not the cars. And with that these driverless cars would be much saver for everyone. But these roads could never be used for that they would take way too much money to be instaled, saying that driverless cars still remain unsafe.

Overall these cars would also be very hard to get llegalised. ¨Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers¨(9). Therefore, it is already hard enough to keep the drivers alert and watching the road while they are driving now, could you imagen how hard it would be to keep people alert when they have nothing to do? These laws are there to keep people safe and smart cars are the easy way to go not the safe way. Also, serious arguments would accure that would only cause problems not solve anything. Because what if this car gets into an accident while self-driving, would it be the drivers fault or the manufacture? Could you blame it on the driver and say they should have been more alert or say that the manufacture should have made/programed their cars better? These arguments and cases would be never ending, because almost all humans do not want to be saw as guilty so they would do and say anything to get off the hook. As to say, these smart driverless cars would do a lot more harm than help.

To justify my argument that everyone should be against the development of these driverless cars, just think about if it was you. These cars can not be pradictable and no one can be postive what will really happen. But what if it was you who got hurt or maybe a family memeber, because they let these unsafe and unperdicable cars out onto the roads. You would have no one to blame because it was just a machine or just a accendent. They are never meant to hurt but everyone would rather be safe than sorry.

1cc3ce2,"Many people agree in abolishing the Electoral College. Electoral Collage caused a dispute in the year 2000. The Electoral College is a irrational system and it should be banned.

Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast."" With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any run-off elections. Run-off elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.

A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" argues that the Electoral College causes "" the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that  the voters can not always ""control whom their electors vote for,"" We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The resonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.

Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes ""that the electors could always defy the will of the people,"" The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors "" have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.

In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all.                                                    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

1cfab57,"Dear State Senator,

It has recently come to my attetnion as I study our states voting system, that we as Americans do not have enough word in who we have as our leader. In a plethora amount of documents from the United States, and our Consitution it states all men are creted equal, when in all relaity we are allowing the Electoral College have more say in who our president rather than we do. Not only does the Electoral College have more say in our President, but it alllows the President to only go to states that they feel is nessisary to go to get the vote. It also gives less say to the smaller states making the people there feel there vote doesnt count, allowing them to vote for any party. If we change our voting system we can vote for our leader rather than us voting for the slate of electors, and have the most popular leader of our country be our president.

The first reason i feel we should overthrow the Electoral College is becasue it is discriminating states votes based on there sizes.  In the article,""Does the Electoral College Work"", it states that becasue of the diffrent sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, "" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote.

Another reason i feel we should favor the popular vothing system is because this would show that the soon to be presidents should vist all of there voters rather then the ones they know they will probably win. ""Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" What the author is saying here is the canidates dont give equal chances to the states to here what they,the canidates, have to say. For example if a democrate is going to states he would most likley avoid the ones full of republicans because he feels he has no chance and does not spend the money. But, if we get majority votes this will allow every indvividual to vote rather a group of republicans. Not only does this allow a better chance of winning for that democrate it allows the voters to feel like they can change there minds because they have a say. This will contribute to the conidates because they can now get there point across to more, rather then to select little groups.

The final reason we should get rid of this system is because at this point in time we are not even vothing for our presidents we are voting for people who vote for us. What i mean is ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose.

As we learn more about this topic we realize how rediculious this situation is. Obviously, going with popular vote is the best solution because we will finally be what everyone has been trying to do for decades, be equal. Sir, i hope you understand my årgument and really take into concideration what i have said. Our presidents make decisions for us everyday, dont you think its time me get to make one for ourselves?

Sincerly,

1d031f0,"Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's ""twin"" and the ""Evening Star"" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work. The author does not strongly support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit due to his extensive reasearch on its toxic living conditions but does acknowledge the benefits of its accessibility from Earth.

Compared to Earth, the author has found that Venus in less less survivable for humans. In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is ""almost 97percent carbon dioxide"" with a surface temperature averaging ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and an ""atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.

However, the author has also found that studying Venus could be beneficial considering its proximity and similar geographical features to Earth. The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the ""most Earth-like [planets]"" as it ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (Paragraph 4). Venus also ""has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability.

Throughtout the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents infomation for exploring Venus being both beneficial and harmful, but he elaborates more on the reasons pointing to the dangers that Venus poses. Compared to current conditions of Earth, Venus does not possess the necessary qualities that would make it a valuable reserve for potentially sustaining human life forms. The author is better able to address the disadvantages of studying Venus because of the extensive research revealing the planet's present volatile state instead of benefits from its similarity to Earth. Therefore, the author fails to thoroughly prove Venus' worthiness of exploration.",5,3.0,3.0,,":

1d0a8db,"The planet of Venus is considered to be a danger to humans given the conditions it is in. In the article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that depsite the dangers presented by Venus, it would be a worthy pursuit to study the planet. The author helpfully establishes multiple key pieces of evidence supporting this claim such as Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus is the nearest option for a planetary visit, and trying to get to Venus is considered a challenge that could help humans prepare for even more extremely challenging environments.

In paragraph two, the author states ""Often refered to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance too."" This quote, along with this quote, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" showcase exactly how alike Venus may have been to Earth. This could be helpful in studying the possibilities of what may eventually happen to planet Earth.

Not many planets are as close to Earth as Venus is and that is a crucial point when the amount of time space travel can take is taken into consideration. Humans have accomplished and gained much knowledge about space travel since the race to space began. Scientists' have meticulously studied everything they could learn about space and can even estimate how much time it would take to travel to different places in space. This is crucial when you take into consideration how much time, effort, and money goes into space travel. With Venus being so close to the Earth, and all those factors taken into consideration, it seems to be an obvious and intelligent choice to make that humans should not give up on travelling and studying Venus. More than anything, it would be a wasted opportunity.

While the idea of being able to study Venus seems daunting, perhaps it is only the lack of courage that is holding NASA back from doing it. Curiosity is a natural thing that all humans are born with, and it never goes away. This is relevant because with curiosity, the gain of knowledge can go hand in hand with it. Without curiosity, not even half of the things humans have done and developed would be possible. Shying away from Venus is doing more harm than good, and it will only serve to produce hesitancy at the sight of any challege.

The author of the Article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" brings up many key points of evidence as to why Venus should be explored and studied, despite the dangers of it. Among those are, it is the closest planet to Earth relatively speaking, Venus is the closest distance, and the study of the planet Venus brings up a unique challenge to the human race that backing down from would be detrimental. All of the key points supports the author's idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

1d80630,"Driverless cars: are they really safe? There are many points to go with the postitive and negative things about driverless cars. Both sides have very important points to make. There are, however, many more negatives than positives. Three negative points that will be discussed in this essay are: driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions and put many people in danger, and there is an increased risk of car crashes if driverless cars are used.

To begin, driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers. If a driverless car were to fail to do a task correctly, that mistake could result in an accident. This accident would then bring up the question, ""who is at fault?"" When this question surfaces, many drivers will blame the car manufacturing company, bringing up the point that the car itself failed and not the driver. When this point is brought up, many car manufacturing companies will have to fight lawsuits and have to appear in court. This court showing would result in a large conflict for the company and for the driver, seeing as many people outside of the issue would take sides. The issue would become a large problem for the world, and would be easily settled if driverless cars were not mad to begin with.

Also, driverless cars would increase the amount of car malfunctions that could happen on the road, resulting in an increased danger when going out on the roads. Driverless cars could malfunction in many ways. For example, they could fail to alert the driver when they need to take over, they could fail to communicate that something is wrong with the car itself, or they could fail to drive correctly. Each of those malfunctions could cause serious problems on the road, and put many people in even more danger than they are already in. Although there are many more malfunctions that could happen with a driverless car, they could all be prevented if driverless cars were not let out on to the streets.

The third point is that driverless cars increase the risk of car accidents. Car accidents happen in many ways. If a driver is distracted, if a car malfunctions, if there is a road block, etc. With driverless cars, many drivers will become more distracted, feeling as though they dop not need to watch the road at all and can do whatever they please. However, that is not the case. With a driverless car, people need to be on a higher alert than they would with a regular car: making sure the car does not malfunction, and keeping an eye out for the worst. If a driver were to become too distracted, they would not be watching the road closely enough, and are putting many lives in danger. If the car were to try and get the driver's attention for assistance through an area the car felt it could not drive through, the driver would be too distracted and the car could crash.

To conclude, there are multiple negative effects driverless cars would have if they were used. Driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions, resulting in many lives put in danger, and with driverless cars there is an increased risk of car crashes. Driverless cars are a bad idea, and should not be put on the roads. They put many people in danger. Driverless cars: are they really safe?    ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

1d8e8c7,"For many years, researchers have stared at the Mona Lisa. They have made countless observations and have even created this new technology that detects her emotions through facial recognition. Creator Prof. Thomas Huang has named this the Facial Action Coding System. This may not seem very important in the outside world, but the use of Facial Action Coding could be very beneficial in classrooms because it could understand the student's frustration and confusion and would modify the lesson to better fit the student, counselors could use it ot help determine how a student is truly feeling, and it would help teachers better understand the students who rarely talk in their class.

Facial Action Coding could be benificial in classrooms because the technology could understand the student's frustration and confusion and modify the lesson to better fit the student. In schools all around, students are starting to give up. They get too angry at their homework and decide that they don't want to work on it anymore. The problems don't change--but with the Facial Action Coding System, the problems and even the lesson itself could change and become easier for the student. This would allow for the student to wrap their mind around the concept that was given to them. In the article, Dr. Huang states in paragraph 6, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when astudent is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This quote tells its readers that that is what Dr. Huang wants this new technology to do. Teachers have to follow a guideline and a lesson plan; they have to be on track as to what the students are learning. Dealing with almost fifteen to twenty students a class, the teacher cannot physically help a student one-on-one all of the time. The Facial Action Coding System, however, would be able to. Making it more simple and more efficient for both the students and teachers. Counselors could also use this technology.

Counselors could use the Facial Action Coding System to determine how a student is truly feeling. When sitting in a counselors office, students may be tense or very nervous. Whatever they're in there for, the counselor will have to help that student. With the techonology, counselors could take one look at their face and find out what's bothering them if they are not completely open about it. The counselor would be able to find out if they're sad, upset, scared, or just pulling their strings to get out of class. A counselor's job is to make sure that the students on campus are mentally in check and are ready for the next school year with their classes and progress. When a student enters their office, the technology could sensor the student, making the counselor's job easier and time efficient. When the counselor is done with the student, they're sent back to class. The system could help students and teachers there as well.

The Facial Action Coding System may be useful to help teachers understand the students who rarely talk in class or are deaf. In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang makes a wonderful point--""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" In class, students will nod their heads when they agree or understand something that their teacher is presenting them with. But what if they don't nod? Facial Action Coding could help the teacher understand that they're going to fast or that the student is lost. The teacher would then be able to assist in further explaining the lesson or even trying to make the lesson more fun and exciting. There are some students who would rather sit in their desks, avoid being wrong, and won't ask questions because they're too shy. This system would give the oppourtunity for students that were never given the chance.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System could be very useful in classrooms due to being able to modify and better fit the student based on their emotions, counselors being able to use it, and as well as letting teachers better understand students who are either deaf or rarely talk. Facial Action Coding may only progress, and progressing it shall.",5,3.0,3.0,,,", hinder the clarity and effectiveness of the writing.

1e1b741,"Driverless cars are the new future to this planet and in technology. There needs to be a new and improved way to drive cars, even if the driver does not need to touch the steering wheel. To support my reasonings would include what Google cofounder Sergey Brin has developed and thought about. The cars that he foresees would use half the fueld of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. Secondly would be that of the Toyota Prius that uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel which would allow you to estimate how far away or close you are to a curb or another vehicle. Lastly would be the safety that the car would be capable of.

The first reason behind my opinion is that it would be less cost effective in the long run which means that over time, you will get your money back from the car. The manufacturers have thought of a way to allow the car to drive and think for itself and allowing the driver to relax until they get notified that they should take control. Cars that are smarter will allow you to save more money and cost less mechanically, as well as save on fuel.

Secondly, would be sensors and displays in the car that allow you to focus on the task at hand when you are driving. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver said, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" In the car that he is overseeing, it uses heads-up displays and information systems that will notify you of an accident ahead or a roadblock that calls for a detour. The displays can be automatically turned off which is something not available to drivers who are texting and driving. Another detail would be that of manufacturers consideration of using cameras to watch the driver to make sure that the driver is paying attention if he or she needs to take control of the car. If the driver is paying attention to the road, then he will not need to be notified and or have the company of that car be notified. It allows the driver to pay closer attention to the road and not his surroundings.

Lastly would be that of safety. Safety is a number one priority in cars and in life as a whole. If your car is safer to drive on the highway, it will reduce the cause of accidents and save you and others around you money. That is why manufacturers are considering using displays that will automatically turn themselves off so that the driver does not get distracted behind the wheel and cause a serious accident. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, which would then notify the driver that they are too close to an object and that they should stop immediately and look at their surroundings. All of the little gadgets that are put into this car as well as other cars, are allowing the driver to pay better attention to the road and the objects around him. Cars are getting smarter by the year which is reducing the number of accidents per day. Which is why driverless cars are a must for safety.

The reasons stated above show how and why that driverless cars are a must for everyday life as we know it. They save you money by not having to pay so much for gas everytime you have to fill up. The car is being driver by the hardware that is inside of it and it will notifiy if you need to take over and steer. The last reason is safety. If the car is not safe, it should not be on the road. Driverless cars are allowing the driver to pay closer attention to the road as well as what is happening around him better than if he had all the lights in his face and his phone placed in the cup holder or in his lap. The driverless car is being developing to become something greater and more useful for everyday human life. This shows how and why driverless cars are a must for everyday life and why I agree with the developement and manufacturing of these cars. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

1ef4021,"In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Chordless phones are more of an antique than a necessity. People no longer write letters, but rather send a quick email or text. Cars are becoming, and will continue to become, more and more updated as the years progress. As handy as it is to have a car with bluetooth and heated seats, is it a benefit to the lives of 2016 to have a car with no driver? Due to all the challenges the government will face and many of technical difficulties this world faces today, the obvious answer is no.

It is always nice to be able to do less. Sitting back and relaxing is something everyone enjoys. However, when a woman gets into a taxi and imputs her destination, she is entrusting her life in technology. Teenagers like the thrill of roller coasters, until one gets stuck at the peak of the ride. This woman liked the car until the steering wheel got stuck, sending her into a ditch. She liked it before the brakes stopped working because of a wire snapping. Many things could go wrong technilogically, that would make the car ride seem a little bit scary. ""If the technology fails..."" (paragraph 9). Even the author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" didn't deny that many things could in fact go wrong technilogically.

Even if this woman did get to her destination safely, many factors had to take roll in making driverless cars possible. For starters, the law would have to be set. ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" (paragraph 9). It takes 75% of congress to be able to take a law to the president. When it makes its way there, the president can still deny that law; furthermore, it has to go back to the congress and get revoted. Laws put in this position do not normally pass.

""In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" (paragraph 9). It would take many months or even years to be able to pass this law, considering they have all this information about driverless cars and only a few places are allowed to even test them. Questions are raised such as ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" (paragraph 9). Too much time is put into trying to pass the law, and in a society that is looking for ways to save time, it isn't worth the effort.

Furthermore, America has other problems to fix. The government does not need to put this country into more debt by spending its time and money on cars that are even less safe for its citizens. When smarter roads became too high of costs to be practical, people turned to developing smarter cars. ""In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track....something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" (Paragraph 3). For 76 years people have been putting time, money, and energy into making these cars more practical. Cars aren't a neccessity to everyone. Certain religions (such as the Amish) are without cars. Mackinac Island runs by horse and buggy. True, that isn't efficient for this huge country, but being billions of dollars in debt, that time and money could be used to help America pay what it owes. In the mean time, Americans can put up with what they have been using for many years.

In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Phones don't have chords anymore. Americans don't send letters by mail as much as they used to. The citizens of this countru have been very efficient on many things. They have learned how to save time and money; furthermor, they have encorperated those ideas into everyday life. However, one item America doesn't need, due to limited safety; the time it takes for laws to pass; and the debt this country is in, is driverless cars.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

1f0cbec,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming""

the author covers many points and facts about driverless cars. The author speaks about the advantages and disadvantages of the introduction of these cars. The author also speaks about the major companies making these cars from Google to Nissan. Nontheless driverless cars could prove to be unsafe, epensive, and have to many negative possibilites. These negative tradeoffs out weigh the possitive tradeoffs thus showing that introducing driverless cars would do more harm then good.

The article states ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and Pedestrians safe..."" The introduction of driverless cars would make this law harder to keep. This would be because the burden to be safe would no longer be in human hands but in the hands of a cumputer and some sensors. We have all had computers glitch or take a while to repond. It happens all the time. But then the safty of human life is in the hand of a computer it becomes somewhat disheartening. Weather conditions could also prove to be an issue with safty. Would there be a limit to how hot or how cold the environment would have to be for the sensors to work properly? With this much riding on the safty of human lives the driverless car seems to be a very unwise choice.

The answer on how expensive these cars would have to be is partly answered in paragraph six when the author states ""Radar was a device on a hilltpop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasent something you could buy at a Radio Shack."" If Radar back then was two hundred million dollars imagen how much a driverless car will be. Only the elite rich will be able to afford one and the majority of the popution will not. This shows that even if the driverless car was to come out in the near future only a handful of the population would have it since they would be the only ones who could afford it. But this also raises the issue with new roads since old ones would somewhat have to be updated in the long run. The article states that magnetic roads would be too expensive so smarter cars would be needed the roads would have to change a least a little to suit smart cars. With the many things that tax payer dollars are used for there would need to be an addition to smarter roads.

The negative possibilites of the introduction to smart cars are endless. The articel states "" in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This shows that law makers are fearful or the outcomes that some of these cars could create. Also the problem with the rise in law suit when these cars would get into an accident would also have to be put into account. The article adresses the problem of who would be to blame the driver or the maker of the car. Not only would this bring out more problems and law suits it would make it hard to find who was at fault. Also in the possiblity of an acccident if people were to be sleeping or watiching a movie responce time to move the car would be a varying constant from person to person showing that even if people were to get involved the chance to change the situation could be very slim.

WIth all of these negative situations

that driverless cars could cause it could be safe to say than the negative possibilites outweigh the positve possibilites. Driverless cars could prove to be unsafe, expensive, and have many negative possibilites. Showing that driverless are cars are not a very good idea.

1f94e33,"Thinking of the 21st century ideas of driving cars and SUV's around is considred fairly overrated now a day's. Opperating moto vehicle in city scapes and rural areas can get so overwhelming; the constant worry of oncomming traffic and pedestrians steering into your direction, dangerous pollution threatning to dystroy the ecosystems & surrounding landscapes, not to mention expenses that are strung along with the cost driving a car. By eliminating or limiting the use of cars, these unnessary issues would just simply....float away.

As we all know as a result of past generations: Global Warming is on the rise. This statement is esspecially true in the city of Paris, France...named to be the most polluted city in the world amoung tourist destinations in Europe. In a act to reduce these smog issues, ""On Monday motorist with even-numbred licence plates were ordred to leave their cars at home or suffera 22-euro fine"" says Robert Duffer who wrote from the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" in the

Chicago Tribune.

Ever since Paris officals had made this change in leglisation, pollution has gone down considerabley. Imagine driving through your city (for example I live in Jacksonville Beach), and there is no more smog, traffic is reduced, and the air you breathe is actually cleaner than before. From putting certian restraints like the city of Paris did on commuting, you too could experince all the wonders of ""cut-back driving"".

Moving onto another terrific viewpoint of limited car usage is a cut down on cost. Now how great does that sound, and in this expanding economy I'll be happy if gasoline prices drop below $2 dollars! On a serious note, the price tags of a car are extreamly heavy now as they were say two decades ago. There are matanince issues, speeding tickets, parking meter tickets, if you have a flat tire then you call a tow truck which....

COST MONEY!

""New York's new bike-sharing program and it's skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal from ""The End of Car Culture"". Now in modern cities like New York, Miami, or even Jacksonville, many city officals have made this ninche of transportation much easier on civilans. Providing local trollys & public busses to help cut the cost of transportation for their residences. As exemplary from Rosenthal, its makes you happy not to drive a car as often... and makes you wallet happy too!

Although many critics are skeptical to obtain and enforce this idea, in actuallity this would be a tremendous favor to all if they participated. Sure if you don't have a car to use for example on a Saturday, then it may seem like a bummer but in perspective it's actually not! Getting around your local area and exploring all it has to offeroutside the four doors of you ""gas-hogger"" is a beautiful way to go through your day! Just think of all the cha-ching you'll be saving with every footstep you take.

WEEE-WOO-WEEH-WOO

NBC Nightly News . Can you imagine that happening to you, or has it already? Heidrun Walter a media trainer and mother of two says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" since making the change of on-foot commute and biking to distant locations. I live in a beautiful beach side town where almost everything is acessable by walking, biking, city bus, Beaches Trolly, or a surfboard! I myself have tried this and rode my bike up to Trader Joe's to get some ice cream. I can say I felt very stress-free by the whole experince. From simply switching to a non-automatic or mechanical form of transportation I not only relived my tension of road rage. I also had gained great deal of happiness from being outdoors.

1feabe5,"You're keeping your eyes on the road, making sure nothing goes wrong, but isn't that what your fancy car is supposed to do for you? You feel as though you're being watched. That's because you are. You're sitting doing nothing bored out of your mind when you could be cruising down the road, feeling the wind in your hair, feeling completely in control. But you're not. At this point in time, driverless cars are more trouble than they are worth. They are also taking away the comfort and safety that drivers today have become accustomed to.

Throughout the years, there have been many attempts and advances made toward the production of driverless cars. These attempt have not been successful thus far. The driverless cars that have been made are not even truly driverless. They still require the attention of a human. One great idea these car manufacturers had was to make smarter roads, but that is something that would take many years and a lot of money that people just don't have. In paragraph 9 of the article, it describes how there would have to be laws written and passed for this all to work out and lawmakers ""know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This shows that lawmakers are not particularly eager to make this happen and without them it won't happen.

Another reason why the project of creating driverless cars should not be continued is that it would be taking away the comfort and safety that drives today are used to. Even though drivers would not be in complete control of the cars they still ""must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires."" What is the point of having a driverless car if people are still forced to make sure the car is safe? This might even cause fear among drivers because sometimes people feel safest when they are completely control and they know others are as well, but with driverless cars they would not have that security. Sometimes it's even a comfort to people to be able to cruise down the road knowing they can take themselves anywhere they want to go. Even if they weren't afraid they would at least be bored out of their minds like everyone is on road trips. The article also describes how ""the car watches the driver."" Horror movies and tv shows all have illustrated how much people dislike feeling like they are being watched. Not to mention, there are people out there who can hack the cameras in cars and people would never really be sure that the people watching them have their best interests. In paragraph 9 the article also proposes the issue of possible conflicts arising if someone if injured in said driverless cars. Who would be at fault? This would be yet another issue courts would have to deal with when they already have so much on their plates.

Although there are many reasons why driverless cars should not be produced, there are many positive things that could possibly occur if they did exist. Sergey Brin forsees that half of the fuel used in cars today would be used for these cars and there would be more flexibility than buses, but there is no solid proof. It is very possible that instead of roads being full of buses the roads are cramped with cars and traffic would be unbearable. Also, buses typically use less fuel because they are carrying around people that would have used more fuel in seperate cars. Driverless cars have also been proven to go a million miles without crashing, but did these cars have destinations in highly populated areas with many other driverless cars around them? It's impossible to know for sure that this fact means anything without have the proper conditions accounted for. The article also says that the cars could have built in entertainment systems, but wouldn't that just distract the driver from the road? They are supposed to be ""alert and ready to take over"" at all times.

Overall, the continued research and production of driverless cars would be so much work and money used when there is already a safe system in place. Without driverless cars people won't have to worry about things changing or fear for their safety. They can just contiue to live their lives as they have for years. The article says that safety is the most important thing. If that is true, the world is better off without driverless cars.",5,3.0,3.0,,":

2027926,"Dear Florida State senator,

I am in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. Changing the election by popular vote is more efficient than the electoral college process. Inputing this into the political voting system would enhance the voting process making it less difficult to deal with, get rid of the electoral college and its faults, and get the U.S citizens opinion on who the president should be and not just the electors voting for the president.

As you are already of aware of, the electoral college is the process where it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and the Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. By the explanation of what the electoral college is, you and I and many others can conclude that this process takes too much work;much more work than really does need to be put into place. Even though most Americans aren't aware of that when they are electing for their choice of the president they comprimise with the most, they are really voting for electors to vote who the next president will be. It's not fair and it's not right.

While reading an article about the electoral college(by Brad Plumer), I noticed that the electoral college system has numerous instances of it that make it wrong. While in place Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. chamber of commerce all agreed on abolishing the electoral college; And I compromise with this agreement because it is completely accurate and make sense as to why these political figures wanted to rid of the electoral college. This is called a ""Disaster Factor"" according to paragraph 11 in the article ""The Indefinsible Electoral College"" meaning that the state legislatures are literally responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. How wrong is this? Also given that so many voter vote for one party for president and another for congress, the House of Representatives' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

In source 3 of the article, it was very precise on as to why the electoral college should no take place. Our country has both republicans and democrats. Not all democrats have the same opinions as republicans, and not all republicans have the same thoughts as democrats. According to paragraph 15, the Electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. This is not fair to people who are democrats. The electoral system is obviously based off of mostly and strictly Republican beliefs. The voting process should be based on just republican bias, but also democrat bias. It's as if the democrats thoughts mean nothing. Paragraph 19 made a claim that Republican bias is baed strictly off of the region in which on lives, because majority of Reoublicans live in the southern states of the U.S. This makes other people(No party, Democrats, etc.) that are inhabited in othe regoins of the U.S. feel disenfranchised and feel as if their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, and that this person is not really their president.

The article gave me an outlook of what the electoral college really is and how it works. The electoral college is not a fair process at all, and it is way the complicated for the people involved in some political job that is involved with the president, it is hard on the citizens that live in this country that have an idea of what president they want to vote for, and it is hard on us as a nation. The election process should be changed by the process of popular vote of the country's citizens. The  electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. The electoral college needs to be abolished as soon as possible. Please take this into high consideration.

From,

204b964,"In today's growing world to many it may seem as if living without a car would be impossible. Our ever evolving lifestyles and cultures though may prove otherwise. Across the globe it is becoming more likely for people to leave their car at home, and walk opposed to driving a short commuit. The benefits of this decision are incredibly impactful on the enviorment, improving human health and saftey, as well as on our, the people's bank accounts.  Becoming a society nonrelient on cars will prove not to be easy, but justifiable when those three points are taken into account.

The effect that cars have on the enviorment is no suprise to most. If you turn on most news channels, global warming is talked about by the hour. Thus proving drastic measures need to be taken to secure our planet's future. What better way of doing so then by reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere. Source one line five states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The article goes on to state in line seven our lives being centered around the use of cars will have to change. Our planet needs it's inhabitors to treat it with the same respect people do to the dignified, and a car free world is one way to do so.

By decreasing the number of people using cars as their mode of transportation good health and safety will soon be boosted across the globe. The effect of walking instead of drving will decrease obesity and increase positive moods. According to source one line 3 Heidrun Walter believes she is much happier and less tense without a car. If she a working women and mother of two can live without a car I find many other people could find ways to also. Limiting the use of cars would not only improve health but safety. By limiting cars you limit the amount of possible accidents. Whether an accident results from carelessness, accident, or intoxication there is no arguing the fact they take many innocent lives daily. By reducing the amount of car usage this will no longer be a major factor in the premature deaths of people. According to all four sources the idea of leaving cars parked in the garage at home, or choosing to live a car free lifestyle is catching on now more than ever. Personally I hope we soon have healthier, safer pedestrians.

In today's economy money is tight. People looking to save a dollar will justify almost all reasoning to do so. Throughout the world many countries have decided to become less relient on cars. By making cities more compact people are finding it very possible to live a life without cars. Imagine cutting the price of not only a car, but car insurance and gas out of your life. I can promise you your wallet would thank you. Source four line 35 states ""We are witnessing a long term culture shift."" The internet has made it possible to connect with friends and family without meeting face to face and because of this the use of cars is rapidly declining. Source four also states many of America's youth are declining the possiblity to be licesnced and drive. Suprisingly enough Mr. Sivak, a socialogist's children do not drive; their ages being in the early twenties. This is yet more proof of our ever evolving lifestyles.

Fellow citizens, at times our lives can deal us many unexpected difficulties that make living in this day and age problematic. Cutting out the use of cars however would not be one of them. Deciding against the use of cars would impactful the enviorment, improve human health and safety, and our bank accounts from draining. All four sources prove the possiblity of a car free society throughout the entire world. So my question to you is why not stop using cars now? The world and your future self will surely thank you.

20fe8b8,"I do not beleive that the author justifies their statement of ""Venus has value"" in paragraph 8. The author does not explain the pros of exploring Venus as well as they explain the cons of why we should explore Venus. Why do I think this? Well the autor describes the deadly, hot and thick atmosphere of Venus, stating that the reason exploring Venus is worth the risk is because ""Venus still has some features that are analigous to those on Earth."" Well, does that justify spending millions or hundreds of millions of dollars on a rover or a spacecraft to explore it? I don't beleive so.

It's quite simple to explain why Venus does not need to be explored or closly examined from high up in it's atmosphere. The pros do outweigh the cons in this aticle, here is a quote from the author: ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" That temperature is obviously deadly to humans, and that is a major risk when it comes to spending millions on making a rover that will only last up to a couple hours just to get a glimps on the planet. Or maybe just to get a couple pictures. The author does not go on to say how exploring Venus with genuinley benifit the human race. The author simply explains how scientists are curious about the planet and what is on it, I do not beleive that satisfying our curiosity will help anyone. This is a quote from paragraph 8 of the article that states: ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""

Now, to add on to the last quote I stated from the article, the author does not state what the human race would do with that ""insight"" that we would gain about Venus, they just state that we would have insight. well then I would ask the author, what is the point in the insight if we wouldn't be able to do anything with the insight that we have gained from the exploration? All that we would gain from spending millions on sending a spacecraft to Venus would be meaningless insight and the feeding of our curiosity. When there are many bigger issues to be solved here on Earth. For example, the crisis that is curently happening in Venesuala, their government is shut down and millions are starving, some familys have resorted in digging through the trash for food and we could help them, but instead we want to spend money on gaining ""insight"" about Venus? Which the article states that Venus is too dangerous to go to anyway. It angers me that half of New York could be underwater in the next thirty years from global warming but we are worried about getting a small peek into the world of Venus.

I do understand why Scientists would like to go to Venus, it would be a great acheivement for humanity. But I am a firm beleiver that our planet should come first, after all, we do only get one Earth, that means we must take care of it. Maybe one day when Our problems down here are solved and we have the ability to really gain benifits from Venus then I will want us to explore more. But for now I'm sticking to the thought that our planet comes first. In conclusion, no, I do not beleive that the author of this article did a good job at explaining why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers of it. Because in the end it's not just the dangers of going to Venus that keeps me from beleiving that we should. It's the problems that we are facing here on Earth that are far more important.",5,3.0,3.0,,":

2101c39,"Driverless cars are exaclty what you would expect them to be. Cars that will drive without a person actually behind the wheel controlling the actions of the vehicle. The idea of driverless cars going in to developement shows the amount of technological increase that the wolrd has made. The leader of this idea of driverless cars are the automobiles they call Google cars. The arduous task of creating safe driverless cars has not been fully mastered yet. The developement of these cars should be stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur.

One thing that the article mentions is that the driver will be alerted when they will need to take over the driving responsibilites of the car. This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so.

Another thing that can go wrong with these cars is any type of techological malfucntion. Every person with any kind of technological device has experienced some sort of error. Now imagine if your car has an error technologically and it takes the life of one your loved ones. The article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings of the car and that is what helps he car to drive without a true driver behind the wheel. Those sensors could have a malfunctions and be sensing something that is that even there and make a left turn into a 100 foot deep lake. The vibrations that cause the driver to be notified to drive could malfunction and now the driver has no way of knowing that the car is in trouble and now you, the driver, and the rest of your passengers are being buried in your local cemetery.

One last thing that the article mentions is negative about the developement of driverless cars is who to blame for the wreck if there were possibly some sort of technological malfunciton or even some sort of human error when taking over the driving aspect. Should the manufacturer of the car be blamed or should it be the driver? No one knows because there is so many different factors that attribute to who to assign the blame to. Some of what will have to be made is a judgement call. When it comes to insurance and having to pay for any damages you do not want someone to have to make some sort of judgement call.

2140b9d,"I think that driverless cars shouldn't be developed. These cars shouldn't be developed for many reasons. As of right now, the cars still need driver assistance, but in the future they may not. What will that lead to though? These cars are not completely safe and accident free, many thingscan still happen. These cars shouldn't be developed because it can cause more accidents, the cars may malfunction and the driver wouldn't be capable of conrolling the car themselves, and then there is the problem of some people using these driverless cars, and some people won't be able to use them, which could cause problems as well.

One reason why this car shouldn't be developed is because it can cause more accidents. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver states, ""The car psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge. We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" He is basically saying that this is actually a pretty big challenge, because there are safety requirements that need to be met. There is also no laws for these cars. What happens if someone gets injured? Who is going to be reliable for the injury? Laws are writtern with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. This seems to be true. You can't always rely on robots, as I know you can't always rely on people, but when it comes to crunch time, and you need to make a big decision on the wheel, people are going to do what's best for them, robots are only going to do what they have been controlled to do. Also, these cars can only handle functions up to 25 MPH. There are speed limits that are way above this, and since there are no laws that would help it, the driver may get tickets for noy following the law of the speed limit. Whe you look at the facts, this could cause serious disruptions, serious injuries, and many mishaps on the road.

Another reason why these ars shouldn;t be developed are because the cars could malfunction at any time. You can't always rely on robots. They are only programmed to control certian situations, not all situations. As of right now, the cars aren't reliable enough. It states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" We need to take these things into consideration. Many people are ignorant, and may not pay attntion to te notifications it sends out. This is an accident waiting to happen. What if the driver doesn't hear the alert, or isn't paying attention becaause they give full control to the car? Then things will go wrong, which could lead to accidnets or injuries. Also, it says that the car steers, accelerates, and brakes itself. This can cause problems as well. Since everyone won't have these cars, the car is going to have to rely on the other drivers on the road with them. They are going to have to worry about when the car in front of them goes or stops, when they pull out or pull in somewhere, if an accident happens in front of them, or if there is a road condition that they need to avoid. Also, there is the scenario with lights. WIll the cars be able to stop at lights, or stop signs on there own? If not then this could cause huge accidents.

The last problem is that some people won't be able to use them, and if they do, not efficiently. People, simply put, are stupid, so why would you rely on them to take over a car when the car stops working by itsself? You wouldn't. Some people also have disabilities that can cause them to not hear or snese the notifications, and well there is people who won't be paying attention to the =m either in all honesty. You have to put these things into consideration when making these revolutionary chnages to the world. One incident in the programming could cause serious catastrophic events. Also, not everyone will be able to afford one of these cars. If people can't afford some of these cars, then that woudn't be safe. There would be some drivers that would have the cars, and some that won't. Basically what I'm saying is that some people will go off their instinct and knowledge while driving, while others go off computer programming.That isn't a good idea, ebacsue usually people use signals with each other to figure what they need to do, but the car won't be able to do that. It just isn't safe for the roads to have both driverless cars, and cars that need drivers in them at the same time. People may argue that these kind of ideas are good, and that after all, the cars may be revolutionary and help the world. It's just that robots can't be trusted, as certainly as people can't be either, but people will be able to make the best decision based on the current events at the time. Just think, have you ever seen Irobot? Anything could happe, and many malfunctions could occur.

To basically sum this up, the development of these cars are a bad idea. There will be many more accidents, more malfunctions, and the incapability of people wouldn't help any either. I think that this is a very bad idea, and as much as I want it to be a good diea, I just can't see it turning out fot he best.   ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

21f7c6a,"Dear State Senator,

Im going to tell you why im in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I will give you a few reasons why we should keep the Electoral College and don't worry I will also tell you some stuff, that's not really good to keeping it.

Lets start off with the first reason why we should keep the Electoral College. The first reason is the big states. I probably have confused you but let me explain to you what I mean. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. For example, in 2012 the popular vote was really close in Florida; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote. In other words, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The second reason why is, avoiding run-off elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; which would highly complicate the presidential election, which is reduced by the Electoral College. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state; for example, Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

Next reason is swing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate, as we saw in 2012's election. The voter who are in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, really listening to the competing candidates. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Now im going to tell you something bad about keeping the Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Let me ask you a few questions, who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding for public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? Well, sometimes state conventions, or state party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves. Did you know the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

I'll admit that the Electoral College is a bit unfair and irrational...but there is also some really good reasons to keep it. No matter how hard it is to decide, I have stated my reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. To me I believe that Bob Dole was wrong when he said, ''Abolish the Electoral College!"" We should not abolish the Electoral College but instead, keep it and maybe make it better.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,":**

2235d96,"Twenty five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. While snapping photos of possible landing sites, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The head is nearly two miles from end to end and seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. This head formation is just a natural landform on Mars. On the otherhand, some people think that NASA would rather hide the fact that it could be life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists.

The face on Mars is a natural land form. The article states that, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" This shows that pictures would be taken to prove that the landform is indeed a natrual landform. The text also states that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the face first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This peice of text shows proves that with the pictures, the head is a natural landform. These text peices show that the face is a natural landform on Mars.

The land formation on Mars is was not created by aliens. The article states that, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Mailin's team an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The text also states that, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were any objects in this picure like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" These text peices show that the pictures would have caught any signs of alien incounters so these prove that the natrual landform on Mars was not created by aliens.

Some say that the face has been created by aliens and that it is not a natural landform. The article states that, ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it ws winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" These text peices show that since it was a cloudy time, the alien markings weren't revealed which makes them believe that the face was created by aliens. However, new pictures were taken and shows that if there was alien markings, they would have been noticed which goes to show that the face is a natural landform.

In conclusion, 25 years ago, a face had been seen on Mars by pictures from the Vinking that is a natural landform and looks similar to a human face. Some say that the landform was created by aliens, but there is proof that aliens had no part in the formation what so ever.

2274cbb,"The author of this article demonstrates and tells us a variety of factors that contribute to the fact that although Venus has several dangers surrounding it, the idea of studying Venus is worth the persuit well. Throughout the passage the author tells us the pros and the cons Venus has, but he somehow continues to try to persuade the reader that if more research and studying is done, it will all be worth it in the long run. Not only does he tried to persuade us, the reader, with his writing, but he also includes several facts proven nationwide by professional companies and sources.

The author solely begins to reference NASA and how they play a role in advancing the knowledge of Venus throughout the course of studies. He uses evidence such as, ""Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Just as our jet panes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground condtions by staying up and out of their way."" The text also states,"" Temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author includes this to give the reader a reasonable idea of what one of the largest space companies has come up with to begin to send humans to Venus. Furthering his persuasion, he continues to include details in the text about some of the innovations many researchers are working on that could contribute to expanding our knowledge of Venus.

Following the details of NASA and their idea to visit Venus, the author includes evidence about some of the many innovations researchers are working on, along with how NASA is contributing to help better these innovations. The author does a very good job at describing some of the innovations created, and how they will help contribute meaningfully to our discoveries of Venus. The text states,"" Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The text also states,"" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computer. Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" Although the author does a very well job at trying to persuade the reader that studying for Venus is a worthy pursuit, I completely oppose his idea and what he is trying to do.

My claim of this article is that all the research of Venus and trying to pursuit the idea that it will all be worth it is false. It will not be worth it, and I can support my answer with several different ideas from the text. First, the text states, "" No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This is a major reason because if something like a spacecraft made out of hard metal, with a weight of a couple tons can not survive for more than a few hours, imagine what could happen with the human body. Secondly, Venus provides a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets and contains clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid which if the human body is exposed to, can deteriate and die at an instant. Lastly, on Venus's surface, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what us humans currently experience on Earth. These conditions also have the capability to liquefy many metals. With these kind of statistics from the planet Venus, there is no realistic survival chance for any human body, which is why I completely oppose what the author in this article is trying to do.

The author of this article supported his claim that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. Although he properly demonstrated why he supports furthering studies, I oppose his idea as I read the statistics from Venus and why furthering investigation of this planet would be in reality pointless. This concludes his reasoning behind wanting to continue studies, along with why I chose to oppose his idea of Venus.      ",5,3.0,,,,"are noticeable throughout the essay.

227691f,"As we should know, ""the Electoral College is a process not an actual place. It serves as a compromise of the presidential election in Congress and by popular vote"" (paragraph 1). It can be good at times but most times it has its downfalls. The Electoral College doesn't allow for a direct election compared to popular vote. Also, there isn't a fair number of votes for each presidential candidate per state. If there is a tie in the electoral voting process it can cause a big disaster. I don't believe that anyone wants constant problems when choosing a leader. To avoids all of the problems why not take the Electoral College out overall?

First of all, the Electoral college isn't a direct election. ""Under the electorial college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Paragraph 10). In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the polititcal balance that large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment"", (paragraph 21) voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itsself.

It's not only an indirect election but it's also an unfair election. The number of entitled electors per state is based upon the members of the state's congressional delegation. ""One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators."" (paragraph 3). This is unfair because the number of ""House"" members is based on the states overall population compared to the amount of senators. It may somehow be good for the residents who beleive their votes doesn't count becasue of the candidate's regional appeals but what about those who fear that their electors won't choose the candidate in which they favor.

Not only is it indirect and unfair, but it can cause disaster to arise if there is a tie within the electoral voting process. If there is a tie in the in the electoral vote ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives"" (paragraph 12). This is an unfair method also becasue now there's only one vote per state and some states have a higher population than others which can and will cause contreversy in the public. ""The pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, may be redcued"" (patagraph 22) but it still doesn't reduced the fact that swing voters can cause catastrophe within the electoral voting process. This is because they are the most targeted voting areas due to their reputations as the ""most thoughtful voters"".

All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfalls. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the ""tie breaker"" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically ""the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational"" (paragraph 14) and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.

2290a15,"The Electoral College has been around for many years. It is not an actual college, or location. It is a process where American citizens select their electors, however proceeding that the electors make their votes for President and Vice President; Congress counts for electoral votes. But, the Electoral College is a very controversial process, many people are for it, but many are also against it. Some even wanting to get 'rid of the Electoral College overall. We should ban the Electoral College for it does not satisfy American people.

Electors in the Electoral College can vote for whomever they want, giving American people the wrong idea and vote for the wrong presidential candidate. In the article (source 2) ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This quote from the article shows that not always can the American people be guaranteed who their electors vote for, and electors can give voters the wrong information and vote for the opposing candidate. This would be going against American people, dissatisfying them. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" American people can be confused, infused with the wrong information by Electors, and vote for a candidate that has no interest in carrying their state.

Larger states get more attention than the smaller states due to their high number of electoral votes. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it says, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Obama had won 29 electoral votes in Florida (high number) due to him making speeches and campaigns throughout the state. Paying his upmost attention to that state due to the high number of electoral votes he was trying to gain. Whereas in a smaller state such as Wyoming, he would not want to waste time paying much attention there where he can only gain 3 electoral votes! This is simply unfair and at most dissatisfying for the citizens who live in the smaller states with low electoral votes such as Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, etc.

The Electoral College has been around for a long time, and in the end we DO receive a president in the end. But, imagine if this unfairness keeps going every four years an election happens. American people not being guaranteed their candidate, smaller states not getting as much campaign as the larger ones, etc. We do though, receive a president in the end. But what if it's a president that we do not want? That we were not fairly given? Just look at what happened with George Bush! There are many simple advantages to the Electoral College, but there are also many concerns that can outnumber.

The Electoral College should be gotten rid of because of how unfair it is to American citizens. If the issues with the Electoral College are not taken care of in the present, just imagine what our future elections will be like. Us American people need to take a stand against the Electoral College, and the process involved. Once a new popular process is created and introduced, it can provide us more justice and fairness than the Electoral College.             ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

22ba497,"After reading the article ""Unmasked the Face of Mars"" I believe that these are just natural formed lanforms. One reason is because this face has many similar characteristics to landforms found in the west. Secondly, because the the pciture only show a natural land form after all. Lastly becuase because we have no affical proof that this was once a alien civilization.

One reason I believe that this is simply a natrual landform because of the many simularities it has with many of the landfroms in the west. In paragraph (12) it states that ""What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalnt of a butte or mesa land forms common arounf the American west. Also it states in the same paragraph that "" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars.""

Another reason that this text has caused me to belive that all the face is , is natural landform because when many people obeserved tha photo many belived that is was a natrual landform after all. In paragraph (7) "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for when the image first appeared on JPLweb sie revealing ....... a natural lanform. There was no signifigance of an alien mounument after all. Also earlier in the article in paragrph (2) it state that ""Sientists figured it was another martian mesa, common enough around Cyndonia. Only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh.

The third and finale reason why I believe that this is just a natural land form is beause NASA has simply no proof that this could possibly that there could have been once a alien civilization one Mars (Cydonia). In paragraph ( 2 ) ""Scientists figured out that is was only a common martian mesa, it was only the unusal shadow to make it look like a Egyptian Pharoh. Also on paragraphs (10) though(12) it states that the weather was clear and all they had found was that they had no signifagance to proof of an alien civilization on mars only to have simular characteristics of natural landforms quiet like the ones on earth.

On the other hand maybe its not a natural landform maybe some people may be right it could be some type of alien landform.

NASA could have done somthing to the pictures to mess with the hopefulls. In paragraph (8) states that "" The camera on board the MGS had to peer through the whispy coulds to see that face. Perhaps, siad skeptics , alien markings were hidden by haze. But this has no relevance because on there clear weather second attempt of getting a photo , they figured out i was just a natural landform becuase of the fact that in this photo it clearly dipicked that it had many of the same characteristics of natural landforms in the American west. This proves even though that that could have been a civilization it shows that it was only a landform.

In conclusion, all the Face of Mars is a natural landform because they didnt have any proof that this was an alien civilization. It had many of the same characteristics of many natural landforms in the American West and that it much of the research they had still proved that it was a natural landfrom because of there findings.

22eb6fa,"With the new Facial Action Coding System (FACS), scientists can now make computers to read and interpret human emotions revealed through facial expressions. One of the applications is using the technology in classrooms to analyze the facial expressions of the students during classes. Personally, I do not approve the value of applying this technology in classrooms to read students' emotions.

First, the FACS technology is a brand new technology with a lot of space for development. It is highly effective and useful in many different areas. For example, historians can use the technology to interpret the emotions of historical figures on paintings and photos. Psychologists can use this technology to aid understanding and analyzing the emotions of patients in order to reselove the emotional issues. The technology may be applied in law enforcement as well by analyzing the emotions of criminals and enemies to obtain useful inteligence. Also, as the article mentioned, FACS has a bright future in animation and video editing. With all the potential developments of FACS, using the technology just to analyze the students in schools to know if they're interested and engaging during classes seems like a waste of the asset. A good teacher is well aware of the students in the class. Teachers know if a student is interested. They can either catch the students' attention or teach without people paying attention. It would cost a great amount of money to apply FACS in all the schools. Instead of spending the money on the technology, it would be better to use the money on teachers' training programs and improving teaching regulations to make sure the courses taken by the students are benefitial and interesting, so the classes are more likely to attract students' attention. This is a far more effective method to resolve the issue than spending a lot of money and applying the technology on students who tend not to pay attention in classes. The main focus of the development of FACS should be on other areas which bring more benefits and possibilities to the future.

Secondly, it would be considered as privacy invasion to apply the FACS technology in a public location, like schools. Personal emotions are definately considered as personal privacy. People do not have the rights to spy on other people's emotions, especially when they keep their emotions to themselves. The FACS technology should not be applied in a way which gathering people's emotions by reading the facial expressions without permission. If it is being used in schools, it surely will be a mendatory requirement because students do not have more control over teachers. Emotions are one of the unique qualities owned by humans as a very advanced form of life. The creators of the FACS technology are supposed to understand the point and respect normal human emotions in daily life. In addition, the use of FACS in schools is relatively not applicable. Firstly, it requires a large amount of funds to apply the technology. Secondly, teenagers in high school are going through a stage of life where they are unstable emotionally and value their privacy greatly. There is no doubt that the teenage students would strongly oppose the idea of using FACS technology in the classrooms and observing their emotions all the time.

In conclusion, it is not of enough value to use the Facial Action Coding System to identify students' emotions in a classroom. Based on the two reasons previously mentioned, the effective way would be ensuring the students are interested and attracted by the classes, rather than finding out whether they're are paying attention. And, it is socially unacceptable and not applicable to apply the technology on students. Therefore, instead of spending the money and time monitoring on students' emotions, why not developing the FACS technology for other more influential and benefitial potentials?

2305032,"From small town suburbs to largely populated cities, car usage can drastically affect a community. In developed worlds, personal automobiles are an increasingly popular trend, and help people go about their day to day business. Many would rather drive down the street to a grocery store of job instead of walking there even though it is common knowledge that the pollution and other harmful emissions cars create is bad for the enviroment and the people living there. The question remains, what are the advantages of limiting car usage?

Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular ""car"", can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Both of these articles explain how limiting car usage in a city can be benificial to both the city and its residents.

In addition, the United States in partaking in this quest for less cars as well. Article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal shows us that ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" It is possible that this is partially because of the recession; many Americans could not afford cars. Also, more center cities have made the ""suburbs less appealing and has drawn the empty nesters back in"".  If this goes on, scientists believe carbon emissions could greatly reduce and this will be extremely benifical for the enviroment. According to the Mr. Sivak's research, less and less people between the age of 16-39 have been getting licenses. More studies have concluded the same results, but only time will tell in this trend will continue. No matter the reason behind it, this example also demonstrates how limited car usage is benificial.

On the other hand, some believe that less cars is NOT benificial. In source four, it claims that the lowered amount of people driving automobiles will be harmful to the profits of the car industry. To further explain, ""companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves 'mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"". This, without a doubt, is to combat the loss of sales and encourage people to continue buying their products. However, thos is pretty much all there is on the negative side of limited car usage. For the rest of the community, this doesn't affect them and is in fact quite benificial.

Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.            ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

2348e16,"Do Google cars truly work? Can humans completely trust a machine to do all of the work for them with their lives on the line? Although Google cars are really interesting and intelligent, these cars cannot be trusted. These cars can only help a person drive and alert them when the task is too hard for the car. All drivers must remain alert throughout the ride, and not everyone can stay alert. Also, what happens if the car ends up in an accident? Someone will have to pay for the price, which can cause immense conflict. Therefore, Google cars should not be produced and sold to customers, for it will cause conflict and danger for everyone.

In paragraph seven, the author states that ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This statement means that the cars cannot drive completely by themselves and will need a person to be alert in case the road ""requires human skills."" Although the seat vibrates to get the driver's attention, it is possible that some will not be able to react quick enough, which may cause a severe car accident.

Because of this problem, people must stay alert just in case they go though a road that requires human skills. The author states that ""the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This may seem like a simple issue, but it isn't; people who drive for a long period of time will get bored if they drive the Google car. In paragraph eight, the author questions this by asking, ""wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" If people get bored of waiting for their turn, then they will do something to get rid of their boredom, hence leading to a terrible accident.

When someone runs into a car accident, most people would blame the driver. In paragraph eight of the excerpt, it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault---the driver of the manufacturer?"" Logically, both of them are at fault; the driver should have been paying attention, and the manufacturer should have known the consequences of selling the car. However, this will most likely unsatisfy the people. Everyone will get into a huge argument which will lead to an enormous conflict.

Google cars are an amazing invention, but it has some flaws; even if ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time,"" people should not trust the car. What about the other 10 percent? The 10 percent shows that it is possible that the car will get into accident, and that accident could lead to thousands of people dead. These accidents will most likely happen because people were not alert during the times they should have been. Can one trust these cars to take them anywhere with their lives on the line, or should they risk the 10 percent and hope for the best?    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

242cec4,"Imagine a world with cars that can drive by themselves; how easy everything would be! Now imagine everything else that must come with this new technology; society would need new laws, economy would need more money, and what would happen to the people? How would the people change? How much would this new technology affect our already-dependent-on-technology society?

The public distribution of driverless cars would cause a large-scale reformation of many aspects of society. This would include not only the cars themselves, but also laws, roads, and the minds of the people. As explained in paragraph 9, laws would have to change to accomodate these driverless cars, and to ""cover liability in case of an accident."" The process of making new laws will forcefully change how people think about certain situations, such as insurance. The making of new roads might come about, also, because the option of smarter roads is open; the roads worked ""surprisingly well."" This will also change our society and the mind processing of individuals, as they will become less independent.

Another characteristic of people wit driverless cars that will change is their ability to stay alert and focused. In paragraph 8, the passage explains that one way to battle boredom for the passengers aboard the car is to provide entertainment and information systems that will automatically turn off if the need for custom navigation arises. However, although this is an innovative idea, suddenly turning off the systems will leave passengers confused and perhaps angry, and neither of these reactions will keep the possible driver alert and focused enough to get the car out of danger quickly. The systems will be distracting and will linger in the minds of the passengers, which can be unsafe when the driver must take control immediately after being interrupted from his favorite television show. If the car then crashes, we must ask why it would have happened, if the systems were supposedly so safe and foolproof.

Other questions we would have to ask ourselves concern the costs of introducing driverless cars into society. In paragraph one, Sergey Brin says that these cars would ""use half the fuel of today's taxis."" However, this decrease in expenses cannot combat the larger amount of sums due to several aspects. For example, building enough cars to release to the public would be quite costly; in paragraph 6, Sebastian Thrun says that some technology to build the driverless cars used to cost two hundred million dollars, and ""it wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack."" The process of building these cars and getting them on the road could be very long and very expensive, throwing the United States into even greater debt. Another problem would be insurance. Paragraph 9 says, ""Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident...who is at fault -- the driver of the manufacturer?"" This event could lead to a court case, and buying more insurance to cover more needs: none of which comes at an easy price.

""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" This excerpt from paragraph 10 shows that automakers are merely assuming that they can surpass any obstacle and fix everything. However, we must consider what might happen if these problems can not be solved. The costs spent on creating these cars would have been for almost nothing, and society will have to reluctantly ease back into the ""old ways,"" disappointed, thinking about what they could have had. It will be better in the long run to prevent the completion of driverless cars at this moment in time, when society and economy are not quite ready for it yet. It is an easy future we must be prepared for, but also look forward to.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

244db43,"""Boom!"", was the the first thing I saw when I looked up from the passengers seat.Two cars had crached into each other.We were on route 33 going to Fort Wayne.The speed limit there is about 55 mph or 60 mph. Both of the cars were destroyed.On the road there were so many pieces of each car.The crash was extremely bad.The people inside were in a dangorous situation.We called 911 then the police arrived and a helicopter had to get a person and took them. since then the only thing that I think about is driverless cars.Driverless cars development would be

be much safer because they would stop before you crashed,they would accelerate alone, and people wouldn't have to worry about drunk drivers.

Driverless cars would help so many people out.The best thing is that they will stop before you crash into something.The article said that there are cars that can brake themselves.But the driver has to remain alert for when a situation requires it so they are still not that safe.With driverless cars you wouldn't have to be so scared because you would never know when you needed to stop the car.That would help teens out so much.In the TV I always see commercials on teens getting into car accidents and sending there last message to their father or mother.And that does happen because thousands of teens die from car accidents.I also read in an article that every person will get in a car accident sometime in their lifetime.It's really frightning.That's why driverless cars will save alot of people.

Driverless cars would be able to accelerate by themselves and that would be of much help.In the place I live their are alot of deer and there are alot of car accidents due to deer crossing the roads. And if the car could accelerate by itself then we would be able to have less deer accidents.the firt instinct that I have when we saw a deer when we were driving was to tell my dad to hit the break.He ignored me because he read an article that the best thing to do when your going

to hit something is to accelerate not stop.But to many of us we only think on hitting the break not accelerating.Driverless cars are just the best way to go.

There are many times when families die because the person that crashed into them was drunk.So driverless cars would make it safer for us and for them because if a person is drunk they wouldn't have to drive.That would make roads alot safer.The article said that maybe by 2020 some car brands like Nissan will have driveless cars which will be better for all of us.That way no one is in harms way becasue of drunk people.An example could be my cousin he was in a really bad car accident because the friend that was driving was drunk.He was in comma for 2 weeks and the had to do a brain surgey because he was in a very critical condition.The driver only broke a hand but my cousin got the worst.That happens so much these days becasue people are not responsible.I know that with driverless cars those type of accidents will be a thing of the past.

That is why driverless car development would be a better way to go becasue they would stop on there own,accelerate alone and people wouldn't have to worry about drunk drivers.It is something that every country should consider becasue all the gadgets people create are for a better future and I know that driverless cars are going to be the best thing created for the future.That way we will all be safer.

247b49d,"The  Electoral College is a process which occurs in the United States to help determine the president for the next four years of the entire nation. It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.

At the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"" and ""Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"". The answers were;not always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.

The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electorals confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guarenteed, will not happen with that comparison.

A winner take all system is in play with the elcectoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candiates focus more on those staes to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.

All in all, the elctorall college and process needs to be abolished and is not fair to the people of the nation voting and being taken advantage of.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

2480abd,"A lot of people enjoy the rush of adrenaline. So much energy is rushed through a persons body when they do something that is looked at to be difficult or dangerous. Once they successfully achieve their goal they feel amazing but they do everything they can to achieve there goal even though it could possibly be very dangerous. This is just like in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". In the article it talks about how NASA is interested in studying Venus but they really can't because of all the obsticles they need to get by. But those obsticles don't matter to them. The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Some ways that show that studying Venus is worth it is when it talks about Venus being one of the only planets being very similar to Earth, being one of the closest planets to Earth and the possible inventions that could be made that can change a lot in exploration.

Earth has very different characteristics from all the other planets in the solar system. So when astronomers discovered Venus they were fascinated to see how it has many of the same characteristics that Earth does. Since another planet has many similar characteristics to Earth it sparks curiousity. It starts to create questions which people and astronomers want answers to. So scientist and NASA want to do everything they can to answer some of their questions no matter the risk. In the text it says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" This shows how Venus is shown to be very similar to Earth. It has many similar charcteristics which shows there could have been life on the planet very long ago. The reason it is seen to be worth exploring is because if astronomers continue studying the planet then they could possibly maybe find a way to possibly live or find current creatures still living on the planet.

When people want to really know about something they will do everything they can to discover more. Especially when the thing you want to know more about is right next door. It's like having a child and candy. If there is candy right next to a child they can't be told not to have it and expect them to listen. They will go right for it since it is so close to them. That is exactly how astronomers feel. They can't resist the urge to study a planet that is so close to them. There are many other planets in the solar system which they can't study because of the distance from Earth, but this planet is so close. In the article it says, ""Often reffered to as Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closets planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" This supports how the planet Venus is the nearest to Earth. Making it easier to arrive there distance wise. Yes, there are many dangers of visiting the planet which can make it seem very immature to even risk going, but that doesn't stop NASA. If they have something close to them they can continue doing test and possibly find a solution to reduce risk and fully and appropriately study Venus.

The other reason which NASA wants to continue studying the planet is because of the possible inventions or spark of ideas along the way. If there are new invention or ideas it could change things for ever in the future. It could make further studies a lot more easy.

This shows how many great inventions can be created or even early inventions from before can be used. That leads to more curiosity and encourages NASA to keep studying Venus despite it's dangers.

There could be many reasons for why people would like to continue working on something no matter the risk. For example the study of Venus.

2556150,"Technology today is beginning to support the possibility of driverless cars. However, there are many issues that would support arguments against the development of these cars. This radical idea is actually rather unrealistic, the technology required is far too advanced for any humans to develop in a safe manner. In addition, there are too many safety and law issues surrounding the automatic cars. Lastly, cars that drives themselves would be rather unbeneficial to people themselves. Development on driverless cars should not continue on farther than they already have.

Technology nowadays has advanced farther than we could have ever imagined. It's true that we have now accomplished what used to seem impossible, but how far is too far? Many of the cars that have been developed have incredible technology, but they all still require a reliable human driver. The farthest companies, such as BMW, have come are things like the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car can handle speeds only up to 25 mph, which is far below the speed limit on most roads. The cars are able to perform specific functions on their own, but are all programmed with things to make sure that the driver is fully alert since they can't handle more than slow and striaght driving on their own. The idea of completely driverless cars is unrealistic, which has been proven by the requirement that the cars need a driver to fully take them over in most situations. Too much time and too many resources are being put into an idea that may take centuries to develop, this time and resources could be put into more pressing issues.

In the states, it is illegal for driverless cars to even be tested. If they can't be tested in real life situations, then how will we ever get the chance to develop them? It's true that some states, such as California and Nevada, allow limited use of semi-automatic cars, but thats a far cry from allowing cars to completely drive themselves. The current laws are based off the fact that a safe, human driver is required to be behind the wheel. New laws would have to override current ones to allow such vehicles, which seems to be more trouble than worth. Aditionally, questions on safety play a major role in many arguments. Technology is wonderful and often helpful, but its never 100% reliable. When malfunctions occur, people will get hurt by the destructive weapon that is an automatic vehicle. Also, the question of who would be liable for the accident would arise; is it the manufacturer or driver? Many conflicts between individuals and large companies would begin to form.

Finally, driverless cars may cause more harm than good to the human mind. If the technology to have cars drive themselves is developed, then more and more things will evolve to ""improve"" human lives. In reality, this technology will likely promote extreme laziness in already unproductive beings. While behind the wheel, drivers would get bored and distracted absolutely doing nothing. Even though sensors and other technology are being developed that would quickly alert the driver when the vehicle is in need of assistance and keep them ""safely"" preoccupied, they are not full-proof. As with all technology, malfunctions would likely occur and cause accidents. Also, the driver may have a tendency to check their phone and do other distrating things if they rely too much on the technology, which would cause even more accidents. This again brings up the question of liability. Was it the driver's fault for not being alert or the manufacturer's for failing to alert them?

To conclude, the development of driverless cars should come to a halt. It is true that car technology has advanced greatly, but everything still requires a functioning human driver. This development is overshadowing more important issues of today's world. In addition, there are laws in place that prohibit driverless cars for a reason. It is nearly impossible to test out the development of these vehicles due to these laws, which should be a very obvious sign to discontinue these efforts. The largest issue is safety. Technology is not completely reliable and never will be. Especially in new developments, malfuntions and technical difficulties are very common. Things have been developed that may alert drivers and keep them from becoming bored, but they may promote bad habits. People would become increasingly lazy and become more unsafely distracted behind the wheel than ever. Don't support the development of driverless cars by making sure to be a safe, alert driver and understand how far too far is concerning the development of technology.

2597102,"Dear Senator,

I respect and admire your position in office for you are always on your toes and doing work for your people. But one thing I do not admire as a citizen of the U.S., is the Electoral College in which our country goes by. When saying Electoral College I am meaning the process in which the election of the President by a vote is compromised with a popular vote of qualified citizens. By changing to a popular vote, everyone is equal and our location won't restrain us from our vote that we cast. The Electoral College may have suited our countries needs in the past but it is now time to abolish this unequal process.

To get things going, the Electoral College strays to many voters away. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", Plumer brought to my attention that many voters are aware that the canidate that they want to serve as president does not stand a chance in their state and because of this they do away with voting. Personally, I feel that voting should be something that everyone partakes in. After all, if you didn't vote you shouldn't complain. But in the boat we are in now, we (US Citizens) are being taken advantage of and are rights are simply stripped away in this form of voting. In fact, one-half on eligible American voters did not vote in 2012 and I am sure the voting process we use has a storng influence on these people. If we were to vote, in some cases they won't even matter. This lets our location define us and not our beliefs.

This leads to the next point that it gives too much power to those we elected. Yes, we did elect them and we should have faith in them, but the Electoral College makes it very difficult to do. ""What Is the Electoral College?"" brought it to my attention that the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. So we simply place our votes in the hands of the minimal amount of people. I don't think so!

Lastly, did those serving in office think about the people at the bottom of the todem pole (average US citizens) rather than those at the top (serving in office)? ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Because of this, it becomes clear that my opinions and rights are stripped away. It completely disgusts me at the fact our nation is treating our citizens in this manner. It is time for those in office to think about who they are serving. Fifty-five people shouldn't represent 500,000. We should all be able to cast votes equally with the same credentials.

All in all, there are in fact some limited benefits of an Electoral College, but a direct election or popular vote would suit our nation much better based on our needs in the present. Through Electoral College it is much easier to recognize who won the election and a few more advantages, but it has become very outdated and unequal. It is time for change and we must act now!

264856a,"Driverless cars could be the future of our generation. Many car companies have taken this idea and are trying to pursue it. They are cars that, eventually, will drive by themselves. It seems like a very creative and speechless innovation. However, there are many questionable aspects of the car that need to be taken into account. I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.

Drivers today have to go through intensive studying and classes just to gain a license. They think of it as the first step into adulthood and freedom. If driverless cars do take over our population, that will disapear. Teens will look past the greatness of being able to drive, and will look for another way to gain the freedom that they are desperatley seeking for. They also will not have anything that they are in complete control of. In the article it says, ""He envisions a future with a public-transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system."" If this happens, teens would not be in conrol of the car, the car would. That leaves kids to rely on yet another thing in their lives. Teens already have to rely on many things everyday. I think that if we add another one, and take away that sense of freedom, we will be taking away a big part of life. This is one reason I do not think driverless cars are a good idea.

Another reason I disagree with them is because of safety. Technology should not be relied on for big tasks like driving. Car companies are being thourough and making sure they are safe, but technology, even today, still seems to occasionally mess up. In the article it says, ""Most drvining laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" I agree that the best way to ensure safety is with a driver that is focused and knowledged. These driverless cars could potentially be dangerous to us. If the car messes up even once, or the company makes a mistake in the programming, we could definately be in great danger. Safety is the most important thing, and because we can never be 100% sure that technology won't mess up, we should not have driverless cars in the future.

The final reason I do not think that we should be excited for driverless cars is because of the law. If a regular car gets into an accident, we have laws that say who should be at fault. Also, it can already be complicated to figure out who should take the blame today with regular cars. If we all drove driverles cars, a new stack of laws would have to be made to support them. Getting used to those laws would be hard because we have never lived in the world of driverless cars. In the article it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a good point. If there is an accident where someone gets injured, not everyone will agree who should take the fall for it. There will be riots and fighting between manufacturers and individuals, and overall, it is not worth it. We should not destroy what we already have for something this risky.

These are the reasons that I do not think driverless cars should be pursued by car companies. I do agree that they would be very cool, but they are in fact, to good to be true. With the many complications that could come up, to the lack of freedom in teens, driverless cars take away more than what they could be bringing. Instead of investing in this innovation, we should use the investments to pursue more practical products, and to continue to make what we already have, better. Driving comes with a great responsibility that technology does not have. That is why I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.

26983cf,"In this article, ""The Challene of Exploring Venus"", the author is explaining the difficulties of researching Venus closer, and why it is near impossible due to the challenges the planet provides. The author states what challenges the planet poses, and how scientists are trying to overcome those challenges. The author also says why the planet is worth the risk of exploration. The author supports the claim that Venus is a worthy persuit for exploration, disregarding the dangers, because Venus has many similar geological structures and could have once supported life due to the planet's simularities to Earth, but the author doesn't provide much more evidence as to why it is a worthy persuit.

In the same paragraph, a few lines down, the author gives examples of the similar features of terrain that the two planets share. The author says that, ""Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" The author means to that the planet has simlar geological features, in the next line the author expands upon what those are. The author states, ""The planet has a surface of sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Through these two sentences from the article the author is contributing to reasons why exploration on the planet Venus is worth it, despite the natural dangers that the planet poses. The fact the two planets share similar physical characterists appeals the claim the author made about Venus being Earth's sister planet.

In the fourth paragraph the author gives a few reasons as to why scientists are further discussing the exploration of the planet Venus. The author says that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in the solar system, and it may have housed life at one point. In the second line of the paragraph, the author states, ""Austronomers are facinated by Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This peice from the article shows that researchers, or astronomers, are intrigued by Venus because of it's simularities with Earth. Then the author goes into more detail about what those simularites are, in the same paragraph he states, ""Venus was probably convered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth."" In this sentence the author expands upon what those simularites are, and how the planets are similar because of their attributes, such as the support of different life forms. The detail the author inserted into the article about the resemblance of oceans is significant because life is not possible without oceans, and Venus had them.

Both peices of evidence that support what claims the author made as to why research into Venus was a good idea came from the same paragraph. The other seven paragraphs of the article expand upon why exploration isn't possible, how scientists and researchers are trying to overcome the difficulties that the planet provides them with, and what dangers there are. Only one paragraph from the article supports why exploration is intriguing to scientists. In this paragraph, the author supports why exploration towards Venus is being chased, such the similar physical characterists and the possiblity of life. The author doesn't support that idea of further exploration to Venus adequetly because they don't provide enough claims. There are two statements supporting why scientists are facinated by Venus.

26d36e5,"The Unusual Rock Formation

When the ""Face of Mars"" was discovered many people had very different accusations and claims. Many people(including scientists) thought it was created suddenly by aliens. Although, that can be a possibility, it really wasn't the case for this certain situation. The reason being, was because NASA along with its scientists have many reasons for the ""Face of Mars"" to be a just a natural landform on Mars. They even have enough evidence to supprt their perspectives of the identity of the ""Face of Mars"".

First, the scientists took many sharpening images to see all the specific details of the this natural rock formation. In the article, it states that photographing Cydonia became a priority of NASA. That this huge rock formation was only made by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The scientist not only took one photo, and were done with the discovery, they took many photos. As the article shows that they took many photos from 1976, 1998, and 2001, the scientists took the information they had, and came to a conclusion, that this was only a gigantic rock formation.

Furthermore, when the scientists took the photos, they also discovered that this landform didn't have anything unusual because they can basically see everything from their spacecraft. As the article states, they took the digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This mean that the scientists throughout the years have made this photos more and more sharpenly to see all the details, and see exacly what this mystery of a rock formation is. So, when they took the pixel size larger and larger they realized they reached the end of their discovery. The reason was because it was really zoomed it, that even if there were Egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks you could see them.

Then, even though the concluding statement was that it was only a rock landform, many people argue that it was an usual formation created by aliens. Scientists and other people believe it was an alien aritifact. Even though the scientists couldn't get a valuable picture of the formation because of the wispy clounds, many people believed that it was skeptics alien markings hidden by the haze. On the other hand, this couldn't be true because aliens could easily still cover the formation, but that didn't happen because the scientist ended up taking realistic photos of the face rock.

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" is only a simple rock landform with an unusual formation of a human face. There are many reasons why,including the photos, and how they came to be much sharper and detailed by the range of the pixels. Also, the rock formation was in Cydonia, whcih really wan't a mysterious plant, considering that NASA immediately got informed by it.

Even though, there has been enough evidence in photos, many people believe it was created mysteriosly be aliens. In the end, it's just a landform in a whole different planet, so how can one simple face-like formation be created by aliens?    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

2705967,"Limiting car usage could greatly benefit the lifestyle of yourself and of those around you. Did you know that motor vehicles are one of the biggest causes of pollution and greenhouse emissions? According to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" If cars were completely eliminated for a week in an area like New York City, then pollution would be greatly lessened. It would be a good idea to try to take public transportation as often as possible, as opposed to driving to work every day.

Another good reason to limit car usage is to bring together community. There is a city in Germany by the name of Vauban (according to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal,) which completely bans driving cars. Inhabitants of this community walk or bike everywhere, which is also a good form of exercise that one could do in order to stay fit. The city was designed with walking in mind, and everything is close by as a result. If we were to have more of these communities, then green house emissions could be greatly lowered.

One major reason not to drive a car is that cars are often very expensive. If you live in an area where public transportation is an option, it may be worth it to not buy a car. You'd both help the environment and save a lot of money at the same time! If you're in a city or an area where many things are within walking distance, then you may also notice that there is a lot that you can do, such as walk to a mall or walk to a park, and you would not be harming the environment in any way.

Pollution is one major factor that should be touched upon more than once. According to a source named

Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, ""after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because of the large amount of people constantly driving, it caused the city to become so polluted that they had to ban people's ability to drive. If people carpooled more, or took more public transportation, then this wouldn't have happened. Some delivery companies even complained of ""lost revenue.""

Lastly, it is a good idea not to drive because of the quickly repleting fuel supply remaining on our planet. Sooner or later, we will run out of gasses to fuel our vehicles with, and we won't have a backup plan. Some areas won't even be remotely affected by this, and people have already created hybrid and electrically powered vehicles. Perhaps if you were to bike more and get used to the idea of not driving, then you will be ready for the inevitable to occur. Although you don't have to cut cars out of your life completely, it's a good idea to start relying more on things that won't run out.

Overall, driving is fun and gets you to far places in much shorter times than it would take you if you walked there. However, there are many dangers and negative effects that come from driving. To recap, the green house gasses that come from cars are dangerous and harmful to our planet, and there should be efforts to lessen these gasses, even it is simply by car pooling or by taking public transportation. Also, people's excessive driving caused an entire city to have to ban driving vehicles. This should probably be a lessen to those that drive a good deal; it's killing the environment!

28028e0,"In 1976 a land form was found on Mars that looked very similiar to a human face. Some people's minds immediatly thought that it was from aliens. This would make no sense because there are plenty of forms like this on Mars. Aliens wouldn't build a form that looked like humans. If it was an alien there would be proof, and we would know. This theory is way to far fetched to be the truth because this is just like any other land form on Mars. We have tons of evidence that prooves that it isn't from aliens and the only ""evidence"" the people that think it was the work of aliens have is that it looks like a face. There theory holds no water, yet people still believe it. Just look at the facts.

They discovered the face-looking form on a part of Mars called Cydonia. On Cydonia there are lots of forms called Martian mesas. It was not irregular to find one where they were at. The fact that it looked like a face was just a coincedence. It only looked like a face because of the way it was shadowing. To actually be from aliens all of the messas would of had to come from them because it was just like any other. There is no way that aliens made any of the others. The only reason that this one is believed to be built by them is only because it resembles a face. I'm sure if you looked hard enough you could find another form that resembled something, and then people would think that it was from aliens, but they're not. You can look at clouds and find shapes in them and people don't think aliens made them. Some think that just because it is on another planet that aliens must have made it, but it doesn't mean that at all.

When people first noticed that it looked like a face they immediatly started thinking that aliens were behind it because they thought that it looked like an Egyptian pharoah. How could an alien that lived on Mars know what an Egyptian pharoah looked like? They are a completely different planet, millions of miles away. Even if it is just a regular face, not a pharoah, still how would aliens even know what humans looked like? And, say that they did know what we looked like, still why would they build this land form to look like us and not themselves? It makes absolutly no sense. If it really was aliens they would want to build of themselves, so they get some credit. There is no way they would of made it of a completely different species.

There is nothing special about this form other than the fact that it looks like a face. It is exactly like all the other forms on mars. Conspericy theorists want to say that we, NASA, know that it is from aliens and that we're just trying to keep it a secret. That makes even less sense then saying that aliens created it in the first place! If we could find something that was really built by aliens, that would be tremedously great for us. If we knew that it was built by aliens we would be overwhelmed by excitement, and we would let everyone know about it. The cold hard truth is that it is just like any other form. The fact that it looks like a face makes some people suspicous, and we get that. Who wouldn't want to know that their is life on other planets, I know I would be amazed if it was true, but it isn't. This is just a really cool looking land form, nothing else. Aliens had absolutly nothing to do with it.

When this face shaped land form was found, even the people on the ship wanted to think that it was made by aliens. It would be great for everyone, especially NASA, but they quickly had to come to reality and realize that it was just like the rest, it just had a really interesting shape. Some dreamers still would like to believe that aliens built this land form, but they to need to soon come into reality. There are so many of these forms on Mars already. Aliens wouldn't want to build a land form that looked like a human. If it was from an alien we would know, and we wouldn't keep it from you. All real evidence shows that aliens were not involved what so ever, but some would still like to believe they were. Just look at the evidence, and hopefully you to will see that there is nothing special about it.

289c956,"The author supports his idea of exploring venus even though there are many challenges to complete the task. Some challenges that come with exploring Venus is that it has harsh conditions for human and and robots, but the NASA has been working on other approaches. Scientist would like study its surface because at some point in history Venus was somewhat like Earth. The author has answers for all the challenges that scientist have with exploring Venus.

Venus is the second planet from our sun which makes the planet the planet very hot reaching 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus also has a very thick atmosphere of almost 97% of carbon dioxide blankets, and as the author states ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our planet"" that pressure would easily destroy any metal. Another fact about Venus is that it has the hottest surface of all the planets in our solar symtem even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. So far scientist have been working on alternatives to explore Venus.

Humans have sent many spacecraft to land on Venus, but none of them have survived this shows why non of the missions have been named. but in recent times the NASA has been working on using electronics made out of silicon carbide because they had been tested in a chamber simulating the conditions of Venus. Another approach that NASA is looking foward to is sending ""mechanical computers"" this devices use gears and levers to make calculation and do no need electronics at all. Mechanical computers can be made more resistant to heat, pressure, and many other force unlike its counter part, modern computers, they can very flexible, powerfull, and quick, but they are more delicate being in extreme conditions.

Human survival can be possible in Venus with a space ship hovering 30 miles above the ground of the planet, the pressure would be very close to the one on Earth the temperature would be around 170 Fahrenheit also they would be plenty of solar power, and the radiation would no be more that what it is on our planet. In these conditions human life can be accomplish. Millions of years ago Venus was like Earth, how do we know? because Venus has features of Earth such as rocky sediment, craters and mountains.

The conditions in Venus make it hard to survive in the planet because its temperature can reach 800 F and the pressure is 90 times grater than what it is on Earth, life on the ground cant be possible on the rocky ground of Venus. Even though the conditions has very dangerous conditions exploration can be possible with mechanical computers. Life can also be possible if we find a way to hover 30 miles away from the ground because the temperature can be 170 F and the pressure would be like Earth.

28d472e,"Every four years there is an election.  The election is used to decide who our president will be for the next four years.  The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections.  The articles ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use.  On the other hand, the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President.  While the Electoral College has been in use for a majority of the time, it is time to start a different process called popular vote.

The Electoral College has been in place for many years and has produced good results.  One good thing the Electoral College does is it prevents a candidate from becoming President if they only have regional appeal.  This is crutial because ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (Posner).  With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them.  Another helpful thing the Electoral College does is it has a certainty of outcome, so it is less likely for disputes than popular votes.  It is less likely for disputes because ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (Posner).  Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory.  Even though the Electoral College has produces some good results, presidents being elected through popular vote will be better, more efficient, and more equal.

Again, the popular vote will be more fair.  It will be more fair because a president with more popular votes will win.  In the Electoral College, a candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes.  This happened in 2000 when Al Gore got more popular votes, but lost the presidency (Plumer).  The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of this country and to the candidates.  If more people prefer one candidate over the other, then the president should clearly clearly be them.  The Electoral College is also not fair because if there is a tie, then the vote goes to the House of Representatives.  The House of Representatives' ""selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people"" (Plumer).  The majority of the House of Representatives is Republicans, so the president elected will be reflected by that, and it will not give the Democrats equal representation.  All in all, popular vote should be used to determine the President because it is a more fair and an equal way to do so.

Equally important, popular vote should be used to elect the President because then candidates and voters will pay attention to the campaign.  With the Electoral College candidates only spend time trying to win the votes of the ""swing states.""  They will not pay attention to the states that they already know have their vote.  In fact, in the 2000 campaign, there were seventeen states that the candidates never visited.  Two of those are Rhode Island and South Carolina (Plumer).  Every state should be able to see the candidates so the voters get to really know who they are voting for, so they will make a better decision.  Also, with the Electoral College people in states that know their vote will not matter will not pay attention to the campaign.  A person such as, a ""Republican in California... have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote"" (Posner).  Everyones opinion should matter and should be taken into account when electing the President.  To summarize, popular vote is the only way to ensure that the voters get all the knowledge they need to elect the President, and so that everyone's vote matters.

In conclusion, electing the President is a painstaking task and should be done using popular vote, not the Electoral College.  The President of the United States plays an important role in our country.  The President has to make many difficult decisions, and those decisions should be a reflection of the entire country.  It should not just reflect the certain states that contributed their electoral vote.

2917d93,"Are cars necessary in today's society? Of course they are necessary. Now, are driverless cars necessary? I would argue that they are not. Cars have been around for about a hundred years, and not once has society put its foot down and demanded a car that drives itself. The driverless cars this article discusses are not actually driverless, they are not legal, and there is no telling what future problems may arise.

Shouldn't a truly driverless car not require a human at all? I personally believe a driverless car should be able to navigate itself without human interferance. If it requires a human, then what is the point of calling it driverless? In fact, all the driverless cars being created right now are designed to notify the driver when it approaches a work zone or accident. So, in case the need to have a human take over arises, an individual would have to be sitting in the drivers seat, paying absolute attention to the road, and await the moment the car will allow the individual to take over. Wouldn't that take away the nejoyment of owning a driverless car? I believe it is even more of a hassle than driving ever would be. A person would have to fight boredom and remain alert while doing nothing other than sitting in the driver seat. To all driverless car companies: driving is paying attention to the road, but the driver is actually engaged, making driving more interesting.

Not only are driverless cars not fully developed, but they are not even legal. Most states do not allow driverless cars. In fact, most states do not even allow driverlesss cars to be tested on their roads. The article only mentions four places that allow driverless cars, and they only allow limited use. If these cars are not even allowed by most states to out on the road for testing, imagine how long it would take to pass laws to get these cars approved.

A myriad of problems could arise pertaining to driverless cars. The article mentioned a very real problem in driverless cars: if something goes awry and someone in injured, who is at fault? These cases would resort in major courtroom battles between average people and multi-million dollar companies. Another potential problem with driverless cars is the change off between driver and robot. If the car signals the driver and the driver does not respond, then what would the car do? A multitude of problems could appear, and all automakers can do is hope they will be abloe to find solutions to these probelms. To quote the article, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Not only are the companies unsure of what issues will surface, but they are not completely sure they will be able to find solutions.

Driving has been central to the American way of life for a large span of time, and if manually driving cars has been working, why change it? Driverless cars have been beiong tested since the 50's, so there clearly is no rush in getting these cars on the street. Also, once these cars are available to the public they will most likely only be accesable to the rich. In time the driverless cars would be more affordable, but the original prices would be high. Driverless cars are getting attention, but as soon as the public knows they will only be for wealthy hands for a bit of time, the excitment will die down.

The system works, and it works well, so why change it? Driverless cars may sound high-end and futurisitc, but our cars now do the job well. Plus, there are hazads and roadblocks the driverless cars will have to overcome first. Should we really make state legislatures waste time debating the use of a driverless car that is not completely driverless? Driverless cars have benefits, but they are not street legal. I see no point in spending money for a car that cannot be driven in most streets and is not able to operate without a human there to takeover incase something goes wrong. ",5,3.0,,,":**

296e7b0,"A life filled to the brim of better days is what we all want, and limiting car usage has some of these advantages. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter. The sound of children outside of the pollution free community is much more satisfying then getting somewhere with dangers involved. A life without cars is less stressful and more free to explore in safety. Driving tends to make drivers uneasy for fear or crash or being late to work from traffic.

""Mr. Sivak's son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving."" Clearly being late to work and stressed is not something people favor espically when getting to work for free is possible. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC."" Instead of spending thousands of dollars expecting an easier lifestyle your neck rests on the chopping block with the blade ever silently above until it completes is mission. Having this ability feels like freedom but it's actually just a fear inducing, death causing machine. A simple healthier life on a bike seems more enjoyable, and even more so when it promotes good health and your life.

""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Not one person can really enjoy a twenty or fourty minute drive to a mall or anywhere for that matter. It's a waste of time, money, and life. Taking a 5 minute walk to a mall is much more beneficial to your body and health than adding gas to your lungs, and it's quicker too. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Children playing outside instead of inside on their new tablet could be our future again. Parents don't have enough time to spend thirty minutes driving to a park when their child seems content on their fancy iPhone 6. Shopping is also a favorite anywhere, but it seems to be drifting online. Taking five minutes to walk to the mall and save money on not buying a car or spending money on shipping will give more money to buy stuff! A bonus is no more wrong clothing sizes or ordering a lotion that smells like toliet water. Ease of lifestyle is a desire that can be fulfilled when waving goodbye to miles of road and hello to a new jeans that fit for once.

Pollution is a horrible topic that everyone wants to stop, however everyone is ignoring one of its sources. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" It sounds like Earth is becoming like the movie Wall-E, and next stop is a ship in space leaving this trashed planet behind. Paris is setting a great example at trying to remove pollution for healthier living and a better environment. The United States has clearly been challanged and in its effort to be the best it followed suit, ""...It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the evironment."" It is hard to imagine a healthy ecosystem with flourishing plant and animal life in our current situation. With Paris and the United States assisting in the idea of other transpot methods not only will animals have a better chance at not becoming extinct but so will the human race. Dying of pollution will no longer be a concern and money spent on poison can go to lifes other pleasures.

Happiness, fast travel, no pollution, and more new stuff sounds like owning a car right? Carlos Arturo has a taste of the sweet life, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Sadly this is not what a car provides because in fact it only reverses these good things. Despair sets in with fourty minutes waiting in traffic while clouds of gray swirl into the sky returning a shirt that didn't fit. Reconsidering the advantages of having a car and considering the advantages of limiting car usage is the right way to live a perfect life.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

1. **Point of View and Critical Thinking: Score 3**

29a7d43,"I love us humans, and our little species-wide neural shortcuts. One example of a ""shortcut"" is face recognitioon. Our brains tell us what is human by looking at the face. The brain does have some flaws in this, though, because we tend to see faces where there isn't one. One of the most notable examples is the face on Mars. There is no way the ""face"" on the red planet was made by aliens, because as previously stated, the brain sees faces where there aren't any, the ""face"" is a common occurane on Mars, a mesa, and any alien proof would be seen in recent pictures. All of the evidence points towards the obvious conclusion, and the most likely scenario is probably correct, as Occam's Razor points out.

To begin, the brain tries to recognize faces, and it is really good at it. It says, ""Yep, that's a face!"" and that's because humans are social creatures. We need to recognize others that will be able to support us and stay together, because in ancient times, that, along with our ability to think and reason, was what we had going for us. As one source that I forget the name of stated, ""Pretty much the only thing we can outsprint by bodylengths per second is vegetables."" We could make tools and weapons to support ourselves, but to be effective, we had to team up. And that is why we see a ""man in the moon"". We see the face by craters. This is just the same thing, our brains being awesome at seeing faces, but not at recognizing the lack of a body to go with them.

Also, the ""face"" is a common occurance on Mars, a mesa. It is just a landform. This is shown by the NASA saying ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West."" The ""face"" is just a landform. The most recent picture shows the mesa in much more detail, and the face starts to fade away as the resolution increases.

As stated before, the picture resolution increases with each attempt at an image, and still no alien civilization! The article states ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" If there was above-ground alien civilization, we would have seen it by these pictures. The logical conclusion for the illogical is ""What if they are underground?"" and this is a valid point until you look at it more closely. To ""sculpt"" this landform, the aliens would have to dig out surrounding land, and that is hard, not impossible, but hard to do. And as stated before, use Occam's Razor. Also, they would most likely have to have some way to see humans, because the chances of aliens on a different planet in a different environment evolving similar faces to ours seems a little far-fetched. They would have some sort of visible, surface-bound satillite dish or something similar to recieve the signal.

Some might argue, ""Well, NASA is just covering up life on Mars."" and to that arguement, I say ""Good job! You are so close to logic!"" because while NASA could cover up the truth, they wouldn't do so. It would be good for business to discover some ""sentient alien life"" because the NASA budget would skyrocket! Everyone would want to know ""What they look like? Do they have a language?"" et cetera. Also, if they wanted to cover it up, no matter how much it would improve NASA, they have to release images publicly. If they managed to do some fancy photoshopping and release the images, there are people skilled enough to undo those photoshops and also, photoshopping leaves some computer traces around on an image, and there are plenty of free online sites that will spot those traces and show anyone where and how those touch-ups were made.

The most obvious conclusion is probably the right one, and all evidence points towards just a natural landform. The brain's ability to detect faces, the frequency of those landforms, and the ability to see alien civilization, if any exists, in more recent pictures proves the point of those who follow logic though the tinfoil-hat warriors try to say otherwise. Wait, is that a face in my soup?!",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

29ad56e,"Technology has been used for decades in education, from the basic computer to smart boards technology has been commonly used to improve the learning capabilities of students in modern times. The 'Facial Action Coding System'

technology has the ability to help professors and teachers around the world get more into the minds of their students and engage the students into a classroom where learning is not a unified thing, but more customized and free depending on student ability.

Firstly, with technology becomming more popular, an increasing number students are having the ability to learn through technology. Along with that teachers and professors around the world have had to adapt to the higher usage of technology and programs to teach their students. This program gives teachers and technology the ability to adapt to their students, and encourage even confused or fearful students to learn by engaging a learning environment where a student's computer or device could read and recognize the confusion or joy a student is undergoing while learning,and therefor helping the teacher know the students level of understanding.

Secondly, having a program installed into the lense of cameras in students devices would open up new insight to teachers. For example, if a student watches a video lesson in a History class and is confused by something then their teacher could find the question, or peice of video, and simply adjust the lesson to fit the demographic and understanding of that child. There are many benifits to this technology including in the home, if a parent were to have the ability to see where their child was confused or frusterated the parent could also take some time to cover the missing material. This also prevents students who are fustrated but are to fearful or anxious to ask for help to not recive the assistance they need. This technology could open up door ways for students instead of them being lost in the information, but this technology is still new. .

Finnaly, one of the main reasons students do poorly in the current education system is that the student feels like they are not reciveing enough help or that they are lost. With average class sizing being anywhere from 22-32 students, a single or even two teachesr cannot assist all of the students individualy, and this creates a problem. Using the 'Facial Action Coding System' teachers can register which students need help and those who dont and pay more attention to the students who need help. This would therefore increase the amount of students able to retain information and help the school. Being lost in a lesson wouldn't be so common of a problem.

In conclusion, the 'Facial Action Coding System' opens new advancments in the the education systems by encourgaing an environment where teachers could have the technology to know when a student was confused or not understanding information, and also giving the ability for teachers to construct a lesson to fit the children who don't directly understand. It also proves a good method for parents to get involved in their child's learning and help the student with direct problems at the root instead of complications with the entire subject. So yes, this technology is very vaulable to the education of millions of students around the world who don't fully grasp their teachers learning methods or are just confused.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

29cf025,"Why would we need technology to tell us someones emotions when we know ourselves? No, I don't think that this is valuable because it is basically a machine that does an action that we can do ourselves. It also may not even be as acurate as scientist beleive. Another reason why I beleive that this invention isn't valuable is because I just find it really scary how exact the numbers are that the machine gives even if the numbers aren't correct and how much of interaction is happening between the face and the software.

The first reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because we don't need a machine to do the job of reading expressions for us when we can do it just fine by ourselves. I know this because in the article they state,"" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday."" This shows that we can indeed read emotions of people all by ourselves. I also know this because the text states,"" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This statement is completely true, I know that I can tell when people are upset even if they aren't my friends or someone that I know. Finally, I know this because the text states,"" Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" This is true to a point because we may not be able to know when someone is feeling worried or frustrated but we know that something is wrong. That is not a bad thing when we don't know every expression on somoenes face becasue that gives us social experiences with other people to go and ask them what's wrong.

The second reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because scientists may beleive that this technology is accurate but is it really? I know this because in the text it states,""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This right here shows that if the muscles of the face aren't showing enough muscle for an emotion the software might pick up a different emotion. I also know this because the text states that, ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle(above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbiculars oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" I disagree with how they are training this software to recognize facial emotion because some people don't make a happy face when they are happy or a sad face when they are sad.

The last reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because it is really creepy on how exact the number can get and how much interaction there is between the computer and the face. I know this because the text states,""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Wow, to me that is scary. I would never want this software to read my facial expressions. I also know this because the text states, "" Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" Why would people want computers to take over little everyday things that we do? This is creepy how much computers have weasled their way into our everyday lives so easily.

In conclusion, I beleive that this software isn't valuable because why would we use a machine to do something that we can do by ourselves? Also because the information being received from the software may not even be accurate. Finally, because the software is just really creepy and scary to think about how much human and machine interaction happens daily and how much much we rely on them.

29d4a8c,"As a student, if I don't understand something in class, I will ask someone about it. Whether that is a teacher, a student, or a parent there is almost always someone who knows. If any one of these reliable sources does not know, I can most likely look it up on one of my devices that has the internet. If we were to introduce the new FACS technology, it may have unindended lasting impacts which could be detrimental to our society.

It was mentioned in the passage on paragraph 6 that "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' ""

The first reason that it could be bad for our society as a whole is that it is not the computer's duty to explain how to do everything and to change to our will. While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.

When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of ""In the real world"" and "" Highschool is preparing you for the real world"". Later on in life, ""in the real world"", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help.

The second reason why this could be bad for our society is the accessibility. Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage.

The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions. Without needing to have face- to- face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.

I learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again.

People also have a right to privacy and some people may not enjoy those particular rights being breached. I am a person who does not let all of my emotions show. Other people may bottle these feelings up in hopes that nobody will see. If people want to keep in how they feel, they should be able to do that as it is what they want.

Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology.   ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

2a7d71d,"Dear State Senator,

I believe that we should change the electoral college to election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The electoral college is in no way fit to be the basis of how we choose the president of the United States. This country was based of of popular soverignty and we should keep it the way that it always has been with all the decison makeing done be the people.

The electoral college is an overwhemingly unfair system to voters. The canidents will not spend any of their time in states they know will not win because of the winner take all system in each state. they only focus on the tight races and some of the states dont even get to see the campaign ads. Some of the states did not even see the candidates at all. The electoral college is essentially one of the most unfair things in the prospect that the candidates dont spend time in the states that they dont think will win and the states that they know wont win are not even privillaged enough to see the campaign ads.

In addition to being unfair the electoral college can cause serious damage. The electoral college have the power to go against the will of the people. Back in the '60s segregationists in the Louisiana legislature were almost successful in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. Also during that time some electors would occasionally vote for whomever they please and not vote for their party's candidate. If the electoral college were to ever go into a tie it would be given to the House of Representatives. During this time the the states representatives will be cating thier votes on behalf of thier state. The problem with that is that those representatives are voting on behalf of thier entire state and that means they are voting for who they want and acting like that it is something the entire state wants.

There are five ""offical"" benifits of having the electoral college. The benifits are certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and you avoid run-off election. All of these things are in fact true but what if you are willing to risk all of that just to be able to be the one who has a say in who becomes president. I know that they kind of do but in reality that does not really mean much if there is someone who is going to completly disregard my vote and do whatever he feels like doing. I know that all of those five benifits are important but isnt my right to have a say in whose president important as well?

Senator, the reason for my letter is that I want to have a say in who the president is going to be and the electoral college resticts that. I believe that the president of the United States should be elected by popular vote because this is America and in America we do what the people want and the people want change. We want the electoral college out and popular vote in.

Sincerely,

A concerned citizen    ",5,3.0,3.0,,,".

2aa01a0,"A future with driverless cars can have many mixed feelings. Driverless cars could help solve many issues, but in the same way cause just as many problems. Many companies have been working on driverless cars now for years, but none have a definate answer to a car without any help and opperational needs by humans. Not having a fully driverless car already can represent the struggle, and challenge of creating a driverless car in this era. So i believe that the creation of a driverless car is a waste. They can be dangerous on the streets, cost lots of money, and have no real need in this day and age.

Driverless cars have already been proven to be dangerous on the streets. Companies have not yet come up with the technology for a car that can self-drive; the self-driving cars need a person on the wheel for emegergencies. Also, these cars can brake, steer and move on there own but need the assistance of a human when challenges come in the way. They need special help, and require the driver who is already at the wheel to take over and navigate through work zones and accidents. Having a ""driverless car"" but with a driver in the driver's seat, with his hands already on the wheel, but not driving makes it reduntant. Why waste that effort if a driver is already in the current position to drive.

If companies are putting all this effort into driverless cars, why cant they put the same effort and money into a real world issue? A nice, new car can cost a whole lot of money, and at a low can run upto 25,000 dollars. So a nice, new car that would drive itslef would run upto even much more money than that. We already have nice cars that we can drive oursleves around in, and with no problem at all. We shouldnt be focused on making cars that would make us Americans even lazier by not having to drive them. Companies should instead put this money to helping find the cure for cancer, or fighting against poverty and homelessness in America or other countires. Better things could be done with this money, instead of trying to make Americans even lazier.

A car that can drive itself has no real need in todays age, people drive themsleves fine everyday around the world without a problem. Some might say that having a driverless car is beneficial by having the car drive you somewhere, but then go back home for another family member to use. That isnt a real need, because almost everyone has a car nowadays anyway. Also, you need to have your hands on the sterring wheel while the car drives so its really not an option. What if the car didnt need your hands on the wheel while driving? Well say something harzardous did happen on its way home or a car crash, and the car needed to alert the driver to take over. The driver wouldnt be present, and the car would shut down and not make it to its destination.

Driverless cars are meant to sound fun, while having fun riding in one. Instead, they can infact be a waste of time, all in determination to find a new product for consumers to buy. They can even be a burden to opperate in; adults and young adults learn how to opperate and safely drive a car, but they would need a new curriculum to teach how to opperate a driverless car. They would need to show what to do during your ride in a driverless car versus what not to do. There is even the possiblilty of needing a different license, and test to be able to opperate a driverless car. So why go through all this hassel, and complexity for somwthing new, when we already have a fully functional car now that fullfils our needs.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

2aa5a24,"The idea of Venus being worth of pursuit, depsite its dangers, isn't completely outrageous. The author of this passage dives into this idea, stating a reason as to why Venus exploration should happen, and also stating reasons that it currently isn't possible. Though the author does touch on the ideas of why we should explore this planet, they do not give enough reason to support the claim, or at least enough reason and ideas to keep the idea circulating within the brain of all of the readers.

The author seems to use at least two of their paragraphs to give why we should travel to Venus, in a sense that we were able to do so. In Paragraph 3 they describe the conditions of the planet, adding that Venus has volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes just as Earth does. This is just the start of the author's biggest and only claim, which fully arrives in Paragraph 4. The author does so by adding more physcial features of Venus and almost putting them side by side to Earth's. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life..."", and adding that ""...Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Later on, they also state that Venus has recognizable features, such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author wrote only about how scientists would learn the history of Venus, and gave no reasoning beyond this.

Though displaying a solid claim, the author gives no further explaination to their only reasoning, and goes straight into talking about the difficulty of traveling to the planet. There are multiple things the author could have slipped into the passage, like the abundance of information that scientists would learn, opening further travel, and the creation of new technology. Scientists and man alike would obtain much needed information from exploring Venus. Not only would going to this planet tell us its history, just as the author said, but it would push us closer to the exploration of planets that sit beyond this.

The author described a trip to Venus as being one that would be no fun for humans, but if able to create technology to keep our explorers safe, there would be smaller and fewer limits on the places our explorers and scientists could go after. By picking such a harsh planet to start one of many trips, the work and energy put into a way to reach the planet would pay off more than the world seems to understand. Though the technology used to get to Venus would have to be updated depending on the length of travel and the conditions of travel,--snowy and colder climates or hot, tretorous terrain like Venus--it is quite possible to get more out of Venus than what is displayed.

Readers do receive great information from this passage, but the author could have been equipt to know more reasons as to why studying Venus would be a great thing for scientists. They did give the wonderous and plentyful reasons as to why it will be harsh to reach and remain on the planet, however. Despite this all, Venus is a planet to reconcile with, even if it means waiting the months or years it takes to make just the technology compatable enough to work with its body.

2ab69a7,"My position on driverless cars is that I am against it. Autonomous cars still need the driver to be focused on the road. The driver must always be ready to take control of the car in any situation. I feel like autonomous cars give a false sense of safety when it comes to driving one of these autonomous cars. The cars arent fully autonomous they still require the driver to have his hands on the wheel in case he has to overtake the controls.

One reason I am against it is because no road that we drive on is fully predictable, so the cars wont know what to do when some situations arise. Most people who buy autonomous cars think they dont have to focus on the road and just leave it all to the car. Thats false, thats what makes these cars dangerous in a sense. "" The can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill,"" this is the reason I am against it. There may be a time that the driver needs to take over and steer the car out of danger, but since the driver had a false sense of security, he/she wont have time to react. They wouldnt have time to react because they might've been doing something else in the driver seat thinking that the car will steer itself. This is why drivers should always be in full control of the car at all times, because no road is predictable and it requires fast human skills if any situation arises.

There might be safety precautions that can try to prevent you from falling asleep at the wheel. This wont help at all in my opinion. Since the driver isnt doing anything, they will feel tired and bored and close their eyes and sleep. If they're really tired they wont hear the warning signs about work zones or any other warning in that matter. Everyone is different, some people are light sleepers and others are heavy. ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" This will fail in some occasions. Say you're a heavy sleeper, and you dont feel the vibrations, and you crash into an object. Will that be your fault or the manufactorers fault for giving you a false sense of safety? Does the vibration have a setting to make it vibrate violently to wake the driver up? Does the vibration start happening at different distances depending on the speed of the car? Also how does one know the reaction time of a driver? These are the test they need to do to know how to make these cars safer. The reaction time of a person woken up from sleep is really slow compared to someone who is fully awake. Also how does the car recognize that a danger is going to happen.

In conclusion this is why I think autonomous cars is not good for the people. Its not safe for the driver who is moving at high speeds down the highway with a false sense of safety. Its not safe for pedestrians who cross streets not knowing if a human is controlling the car or not. Streets will never be predictable and the computers on the car will go off of predictability. Yes there will always be a traffic hazard everywhere you go, and the car might not know what to do and its up to you to get yourself and the car out of harms way. This wont happen if you're asleep at the wheel thinking the car will do it itself and you wont have to do a thing. I feel like if a person is wanting to buy a autonomous car, they will have to take courses on how to correctly use the controls and also what to do when theres an emergency ahead. They will have to know the fundimental things like dont fall asleep on the wheel, always be focused and looking for potentional hazards ahead. Always put your hands on the wheel whenever the car tells you to. Also the main thing they should focus on is to never trust the car to get you from one place to another without your assistance along the way. Thats why in think autonomous cars a negative thing.                    ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

2aca278,"One big milestone in a person's teenage years is when they have to take a driver's test to get their license. Many people often become stressed behind the wheel during the driver's test because they are afraid of making mistakes. The people of our generation are just as nervous about these test as our older generations but what if that were to change in the future? What if, instead of driving cars where we have to be driving one hundred percent of the time, there were cars out there that allowed the car to do the driving for us? Many companies have been working on the idea of ""driverless cars"" in hopes that they will reshape the whole concept of driving. However, that does not mean they are a good thing. Driverless cars should not be used in the future because they could take away the focus of the driver, the future generation wouldn't know about driving basics, and they are illegal in some states.

First of all, they could take away the focus of some drivers. As these driverless cars are being invented, they allow drivers to meerly sit back in the drivers seat and enjoy the road. Sitting for thirty minutes in a car will not be enough to satisfy the boredom of some people. There are people out there who can not deal with sitting in one place for a few minutes and have to do something to keep them busy. Therefore, their focus could easily move to something else other than the road, like a fellow passenger or at the scenery around them. Driverless cars are not entirely driverless. As said in the article, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" What if the driver is not prepared to take over when the situation requires? These new cars may have features of notifying an individual when they need to take over but if they are not ready because they were focused on something else, then the results could be disastirous. This is why it takes away focus from drivers.

Next, the future generation would not know about driving basics. Many teenagers today have to take drivers ed classes as they attempt to obtain a license from the BMV. But what would future generation drivers have to go through for their driving exams if we have driverless cars. As stated before, driverless cars aren't entirely driverless. The newer generations still have to learn to basics of driving even if they will be driving in a driverless car in the future. If this does not happen, then they could be in trouble if their driverless cars malfunction or they are forced to drive a regular car instead. The future generations will probably not know about the driving basics because they will think they are too far advanced for it. For example, not many people know how to drive ""stick"" or even know what that means even though it was vital for driving long ago. If someone were to enter a car that needed that kind of function, they would not know what to do. And the same thing applies to future generations if they would not know the driving basics.

Finally, these vehicles are against the law in some states. According to the article, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control ata all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" With the government concerned about the safety of a driver behind the wheel, they will not allow driverless cars on the roads. The safety of the people is more important than to advancement of technology. Until the driverless cars have been updated to the time where they are safe for everyone, there is no way that driverless cars will be seen on the roads with regular cars for quite some time. This is why driverless vehicles are against the law in some states.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be used in the future because they take away the driver's focus, the future generations need to learn about the driving basics that we use today, and it is illegal to use computer-driven cars. Of course, in the future, new technology will arise to give people more mobility and ways of transportation but that will not happen until everyone is safe. Many individuals are in car crashes every year from lack of focus on the road. Driverless cars can add to this problem just like any other and until we have to tools necessary to ensure they safety of the people using driverless cars, there is no way that they will be seen among the streets.

2af44aa,"The Debate of the Faces

A new technology called Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to show human emotions by facial expressions, is not valuable to students in the classroom. I do not think that a computer system to read the emotions of students is needed for a quality education. Students have been learning in schools without the Facial Action Coding System for hundreds of years, so why would the Facial Action Coding System help us now? The Facial Action Coding System could actually be unbeneficial to students in the long run. This system could make students feel uncomfortable and insecure about their learning.

The main reason that the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to students in a classroom is beause it is invading to the students privacy. The students may feel like their emotions are invaded by a computer that is constantly watching them. The Facial Action Coding System could make the student feel like they are being pressured and that their emotions for a certain day can alter their learning style. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsin a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"" (D'Alto). This shows that the system can watch the students' every move. Would you like to be watched all day by a computer that is reading your mood?

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System is not needed in the classroom is because many classes in school are taught by a teacher, not by computers. The Facial Action Coding System might not be used at all if the school is taught by a majority of teachers, which could be a waste of money and software. Dr. Huang says in paragraph 6 that 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Even though this statement is true about the Facial Action Coding System, many lessons in schools are not taught by computers, but are taught by teachers. The teacher could also probably tell if the students are bored or confused so they could alter their lessons. In paragraph 5, the author says that, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto). This shows that the classroom teacher could effectively alter their lesson based on the expressions of the students, just as the Facial Action Coding System could.

In some cases the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to the classroom and learning environment. If a student is taking online courses or a school is predominantly taught by computer lessons, the Facial Action Coding System would help students stay more focused. The system could try to change the way of teaching based on the viewer's expressions. The system can also be beneficial to ads on computers. ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto). This shows that the Facial Action Coding System could also make ads more interesting for those on computers often.

The Facial Action Coding System is definetly an amazing invention to computers and reading facial expressions. Although it is a great invention, I do not think that schools are ready for a program that studies the students' faces. This technology should not be used so it can protect the students' privacy, make them feel comfortable in the learning environment, and make them feel like their lessons are not forced. Many schools are also probably still taught by a majority of teachers, whearas the Facial Action Coding System would not be needed at all. All in all, it depends on where you fall in the debate of the faces.",5,3.0,,,":**

2b14412,"Dear Senator,

""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens""(Office of the Federal Register1). Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected. For this, the Electoral College should be retained due to its contribution to successful elections even though there are some instances which occur and to help the elections remain fair and equal. Additionally, this process should be continued, but there are certain aspects that would argue for changing the aged process.

In Richard Posner's, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" he incorporates in his defense, that the electoral votes are awarded in a winner-take-all basis, which means that the states play an important role in the deciding factor of who will become the next President. Posner explained theoretically, ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 perecnt of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state"" (Posner 1). With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the canidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states. Thus, this method or process is successful in ways many people do not aknowledge. The citizen's votes do matter, when every aspect is put into a big picture and taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College alllows for everyone to have the chance to be apart of the elections. The Office of the Federal Register explains, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" (The Office of the Federal Register 1). This adds suppprt that at the end of the election, almost every part of an election including votes, is taken into consideration, thus making the election a sucessful one.

In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, ""What Is The Electoral College,"" there is certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the canidates and the citizens who are voting. This is reliterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, "" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...(Office of the Federal Register 1). In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president""(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, "" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election""(Posner 1).  Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

Lastly, the Electoral College is the best way to determine a president, but there are some flaws. For example, Plumer explains, ""... Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but list the presidency over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (Plumer 1). The elecotral college could alter the outcome of an election dramtically. Another issue that Plumer wants people to know is that, "" Under the electoral collge sysytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors..."" (Plumerr 1). This is true but also could be a little dramatic. Ultimately, the citizens are the ones who are voting for the candidates not the electors. Without the vote from the citizens there would be no electors. The Electoral College process should still be kept even though there are some issues.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elecions which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Posner states, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (Posner 1). The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.                                                                             ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

2b89aad,"The author states that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. How well does this author truly show this? He shows how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, it's often reffered to as earth's twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks.

People from earth can see Venus just by looking up at the right place. The author states, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."" So from afar we can see it as a big ""light"" in the sky, kind of like a star. But Venus is not a star it is a planet. What he means by this is that you can see how bright Venus is from afar but what you can't see what it is really like close up. But if we dont know what Venus is like close up then how do we know it is Earth's ""twin""?

Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". According to the text ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the clostest distance too."" The passage also states, ""Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" So if Venus is so much like earth then why can't we send a spacecraft to Venus now? Well we tried and it didnt workout. There was a spacecraft sent unmanned because the spacecraft could only survive the landing for three hours. Venus today still have some features that are close to ours on earth. Could this mean it could become safe sometime? Doubtful. According to the passage, ""Venus is a planet that has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters."" So why do we need to get so up close to Venus even though it causes risks?

Wouldn't you like to know whats on Venus even if it could be dangerous? I beileve this is why the author suggest thst Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it precents. You may wonder what thoes dangers are. According to the passage, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" So why should we still go? NASA is finding a possible solution to the hostile conditions. According to the text ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hoveriing 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground confitions by staying up and out of their way."" It also states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means we would be able to see and get more information about Venus.

I conclude that because of all the new findings that this is why the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit dispite the dangers. If Venus is like Earth does that mean that what happened to Venus might happen to us? This is why we need more information. The author shows us how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, its often reffered to as earths twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks. These are very important to know when deciding weather it is a good idea to travel to Venus even with the dangers. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

2b98752,"The United States has ways of being civilaized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. The U.S should stick with the Electoral College because its a game changer and trust worthy.

To start off the Electoral College is a game changer for Election Day. In the article "" In Defenese of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of  popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example, "" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". In this peice of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger then the popular votes. Now in the article ""the indfensible Electoral College"" which was written by Bradford has a different claim. Bradford states "" because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". From this Bradford wants to express that the Electoral College is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. But even thought Bradfort disagrees with the method, Bradfort still stated the obvious. In the article Plumer states "" taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plumer disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. Basically the Electoral College is just a big game chnager on Election Day.

Futhermore the Electoral College is just a trust worthy method to use. Also it was like the first method to be used. In the first source ""What is the Electoral College"", the author gives some great information. The office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. The reason is because each state has an Electoral college and those states are in differnet parties. If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican party. From the other side of Bradford again wants a comeback. In his article Bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refuesd to vote for their party's candidate"". Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. So the electoral college just gives people want they want from trust.

All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college  represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

2ca50cd,"The future is full of new and exciting technologies, including the ""driverless car"". The idea of a car that can drive itself is exciting, but also very dangerous. Although there are precautions the companys have taken to prevent accidents, something could always happen, and no company has found the answer to who is at fault if there is an accident.

Driverless cars may seem like an exciting new way to travel, but there is not a way for the driver to completely relax. The driverless cars cannot drive where there is not a smooth course. If there is construction work or an accident the car can not drive, and requires the skills of a human, which makes the name ""driverless car"" falsely stated. The way the cars alert the driver that their assitance is needed, is just by annoucing that the driver needs to take over. This way of getting the driver's attention may not always end in success if the driver is distracted and not paying attention to the car or the road.

Why not have a human drive instead? The driver has to always be alert and ready to take over in a driverless car, so why not just drive normally? It does not make sense for a driver to sit in a car and wait until they have to take over and drive, and that drive may only take five minutes. It is pointless to have a computer drive and to have the person in the driver's seat be alert.

Driverless cars are also making it ""fun"" to drive in a car where a person is not needed nighty percent of the time. Some manufacturers are planning to bring in car entertainment systems, which is another distraction to drivers on the road. Also, not needing to drive gives people more opportunites to be on their cellphones, read road signs, or look at the scenary instead of the road. All of these distractions are giving drivers more reasons to not pay attention to the road, and will prevent them from taking over the car when the computer can no longer drive.

Driverless cars are dangerous, but they do bring some goods to the table. Driverless cars are estimated to only use half of the fuel that regular cars use today, which can help the environment immensely. They are a new and exciting way to travel and get around, and if all the drivers are paying attention, can prevent accidents because of the sensors and cameras.

Driverless cars are exciting, but they are dangerous and have never been tested in real situations, like a family going on vaction, or someone going to work. The outcomes are unknown, something can always go wrong, and no manufacturers know who will be blamed when something does go wrong. The cons outweigh the pros, driverless cars are dangerous and cannot be trusted to handle situations if a driver is not paying attention. Driverless cars should not be developed and sold.

2d356a1,"The ""Evening Star"" as the author from ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" is another name for venus. Venus known for being inhospitable to humans has been subjected to debate if we should send more explorations to the planet the author of this article thinks so. The author debates that the value of going to venus is worthy despite the dangers and obsticles we face.

A point that the author provides is that Earth is similar to Venus and that we should conduct further studies on the planet. A point that the author makes quite often to show that we can learn about our planet based off learning from Venus, ""Today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters"" (Exploring Venus). from this peice of evidence it is clear that the author is trying to establish a link between earth and venus, That venus is very similar to us so it is worth exploring. Another example of the author connecting earth and Venus is when the author writes about what could of been on Venus ""Long ago, Venus was Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth"" (Exploring Venus). The wrtitter of this story specifically said ""just like Earth"" because his goal is to establish the scientific evidence that could be gained from going to Venus because it is similar to Earth.

Furthermore the another reason that NASA should send a manned mission to Venus is that it may be the only chance at a expodition to another planet. The author provides information on how close Venus is and how this can be crucial ""occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimnes we are closer to mars and other times Venus"" (Exploring Venus). The author provided this information to follow up with another quote that comes in a later paragraph. The author follows up on this saying that venus is our the closest planet to us and that going some place closer will lessen space time travel ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Exploring Venus). This is crucial to have considering that many other planets our very far away making them harder to get to and making them more expensive missoins. So when venus is closer this will increase the support of a trip to evaluate venus because it will be less expensive and easier to get to then a normal space exploration.

How do we finally explore Venus if its worth the pursuit the author describes this as being a challenge but one that we must overcome to explore venus. One way that NASA can over come overcome the challenge of exploring venus is by using technology that is old bulky but most importantly strong. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (Exploring Venus). This is an important peice of information the author provides to over come the challenge of going to Venus and that we can be saved by technology from the past. Another way NASA could send astronauts to venus is through a giant Blimp in the upper atmosphere of venus ""A Blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roling Venusian landscape"" (Exploring Venus). a blimp is very helpful when it comes to not burning alive on the surface of venus because it is to hot but this approach according to the author also has some set backs. ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal"" (Exploring Venus). This is important to know considering that the authors main point is that we need to actually explore Venus but this hinders us to actually do so which ultimately defeats the whole purpose.

In concluison Venus is a chaotic and hot place unable to support life but the Planet is also worth exploring. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" insist that going to Venus instead of other planets is worth it because the value of going to venus is worth it despite the challenges we face going there, the author presents this claim by explaining that, it is similar to Earth so we can learn about our planet as well as Venus. Also Venus is close so this can save time traveling to it and that we have to overcome challenges to get their but it is ultimately worth going.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

The author even talks about how humans have already sent numerous space craft to venus in paragraph two ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" and just a sentence after that it tells us ""numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challanging planet for humans to study, despite its proxmity to us."" so the author tells that us despite the issue of how dangerous it is to land there, it still tells us as readers that we are still studying it despite how much of a challange it is, and just because we are close to it doesn't make it any easier to study.

In paragraph four he starts telling us why its worthy, despite how hard it is to study by saying ""astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like plane in our solar system."" and then continues on to say ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" so he is implying that benefits of studying Venus would be that we would be able to see if there were other life forms on the planet in the past, and that we would be able to find out what happened to the past earth like planet. The author also keeps telling us that Venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit, so that it would be cheaper to get there and we could try to study it more without spending too much despite the dangers. Cheaper then its counterpart Mars at least. He even tells us of some ways that NASA has ideas for sending humans to Venus so that we would be able to study it without that much effort despite the dangers.

The author even supports his claim in paragraph eight by saying ""Striving to meet the challange presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" by saying that he tells us some of the benefits like how studying the planet has value, but he also tells us that we will likely be studying other dangerous planets and that this is just one of the many we will be studying so doing this one is no different and that it would be well worth the challange, but also the insights we would earn from the planet itself. In the next sentence he tell us that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" the author is telling us that we should not be scared of the dangers and doubts, but that we should improve upon ourselves and shove ourselves to the edge of imagination and innovation, despite the dangers and that it is well worth the risk.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

2db6925,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that the exploration of Venus is worth its risks. In the article, they state that it would be worth investigating because there is a potential that humans could survive there, but not without its challenges. The author provides a fair amount of evidence that states Venus could be an issue to gather information about. Overall, the author provides a contradicting article and is somewhat difficult to understand what side he supports, exploring Venus or to not.

The author provides reasons that Venus should actually be looked into. The reasons the author provides are: the geographical conditions on Venus used to be similar to what Earth has today, that the planet is the closest planet to ours, and could have at one point, ""...supported various forms of life, analogous to those on Earth."" The author doesn't provide a lot of evidence for any of these reasons other than the types of geographical features that are similar between Earth and Venus. The author does, however, provide technology-related solutions to the problems relating to how we could explore Venus. The author provides blimp-like, manned vehicles that could get within 30 miles or so above the planet. The author also provides simplified electronics made of a material known as, silicon carbide that could survive three weeks in the conditions that Venus has. The author then concludes his reasoning with how, ""... human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This simply means that we're just as likely to do something as risky and fear-inducing as exploring Venus and that we shouldn't be imaginatively contained because there are dangers that could possibly limit our expansion.

While the author has some reasons supporting the exploration of Venus, they have provided many challenges NASA, or any other space program, would have to overcome and downfalls to the planet. The author provides reasons such as: no aeronautic vehicle has been able to survive the landing for more than a few hours, the planet's atmosphere is almost 97% carbon dioxide, the temperature is 90 times greater than Earth's (800 degrees Farenheit), the pressure on the surface is enough to crush a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans, and how our use of modern computers would be limited due to the extreme physical conditions that they would have to withstand. The author provides an abundance of, somewhat, overwhelming reason that we shouldn't continue to proceed exploration of Venus.

While the author provides some good reasons to explore Venus and what it contains, they also happened to contradict almost every reason with why it would be a bad idea to pursue it, which is fairly counter-intuitive. The author perhaps meant to give these reasons to warn us and for us to bear the information of how it could go wrong, or how it would be a struggle and then come to terms with the idea that it would still be a good idea to explore Venus. But again, its also comprehended that the author themself doesn't want us to explore the planet. I feel that the author clearly portrayed the distaste that the exploration could bring and less clearly of why and how it would be a good idea.",5,3.5,,,":**

2e128b5,"Driverless cars, also known as autonomous cars are dreams from the future. We have all seen them in movies. Today's innovations are begining to make autonomous cars a tangible concept. In fact,they are already being designed. Driverless cars have been imagined since the General Motor's concept car. The first autonomous cars were driven by radio signals and magnets, but these things proved to be too impractical. The development of futuristic cars are a contraversial topic. I believe that driverless cars should be developed because they are gas-efficient, time-saving, and safer

Driverless cars save time. During the time spent driving, someone could be doing their homework, or reading a book. Drivers can continue their daily life by drinking morning coffee or eating breakfast. Drivers would not need to be alert and focused on the street when their attention could be better used elsewhere. Instead of the time spent driving they could manage their time. For example, on a roadtrip, the mom could be preparing dinner instead of driving. Instead of driving an EMT could already be working on an inured person. This time would allow faster medical attention and save lives. These concepts are entirely possible with future innovations. However, is still room for improvement. Cars still require human assistance to navigate through tricky areas. GM vibrates the seat and Google simply announces it.

Which brings us to our next topic, gas. Gas is an unrenewable resource, meaning once it is depleted, it is gone forever. Sergey Brin says that the new driverless car will use half of the fuel of a modern day taxi. These cars could change the world. If we consume less fuel, as a result, the fuel will last longer. This will also reduce emissions and pollution. With pollution reduced, the effects of global warming will also be reduced, preserving endangered animals. Autonomous cars would allow for time for scientists to search for a new sources of fuel. Driverless cars are also more flexible than buses.

Some people may argue that driverless cars are dangerous. If the car were to malfunction and the passenger is unable to assist, it could result in a crash. The liability is huge, for on whom would the blame be placed? Once a perfected model of a driverless car emerges, this danger is eliminated. Many accidents are made while the driver is texting, or under the influence. Many driver's get distracted. With autonomous cars, these factors do not matter. The car will safely navigate you to your destination no matter what you are doing. Automatic functions have already prevented numerous accidents. Antilock breaks detect danger and prevent uncontrollable skids or rollovers.

Maps, sensors, computers, and radars, are Innovations we did not have in 2000. At the rate we are learning and inventing new things, driverlesscars will be here in no time. BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" can already steer, accelerate,and brake themselves. I support the development of autonomous cars, because they are time-saving, pollution-reducing, and safer.",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

2e78299,"Should the world create new driverless cars? The world needs something new I think, I am for the development of these cars.

Why do I agree with the development of these cars? The world has been driving cars for more than 100 years, and I think the it's time for something new, the world is moving at a rapid speed of new and advanced materials, such as our technology, we need to develope these cars because the world would be up to date to where it has to be. There are a couple reasons why I think these cars should be made!

It's a new way of traveling and a new of seeing how the world can coast off this invention. Think about it, everyone has either talked about wanting to have flying cars or driverless cars, we can't get there if we don't try, from where the world is at right now, it is time for a new spice in the cabinet.

If these cars are developed it would only take up half of the gas a regular taxi would usually use, that's less pollution and that would help out the world itself drastically. Sensors are on the cars, that gives the car a idea of its surroundings and know where to go. Anti lock brakes are there and are always on because just in case of emrgency.

At the same time, there are its cons, such as if you were to get injured or to get in a wreck, who is to blame, the car company or the person in the car? If we did end up making these cars, these laws have to be established so everyone knows just in case if they were in an accident. Also, why would we want a car

that still may need human assistance if it's suppose to be a driverless car? That doesn't sound like the american dream, I mean it's getting closer but it's not where we want to be. Us humans can't relax when we get in the car if the car still or may needs assistance from time to time, we might as well just drive our cars if it still needs us to drive from time to time. We shouldn't be in a hurry if we still can't have a legit driverless car, if we need time, take the take time, I think the world would rather have a car to where the driver has to absolutely nothing, and can sit back and relax 10 years from now, then to have a car to where the car drives 75% of the time and you drive the other 25% next month.

I agree that these types of cars should be made but lets not rush, lets get it perfect to where the world technically not have to drive. Like the article said in paragraph 10, ""The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day.""

2e95e4d,"Since remotely times, the man had look for some way to make his life easier, since primitive hunting weapons, to carriages. The carriages were pulled by horses mostly, and on those times, the most that those animals could do for contamination was pooping but the owners had people to clean for it as well as someone who took care of it. While the times had change, the transportation media has too as well with the cars; which it actually result to be a doble sided blade contaminating with smog.

In Paris the government has banned driving due to smog, the smog has caused a huge impact on this city, giving to it cooler nights and warmer days, many habitants blame Diesel fuel, but it does not matter which fuel you would use, it would burn and produce smog anyways. On the other hand, Vauban, Germany, is offering a new life style that many people has decided to adopt; the suburbian comunity has no cars at the streets, people there does not own a car because they do not need it, the public transportation works very well, so it is not a primary need. They can live perfectly without cars, then they are not that necesary. Many people even sell their cars in order to move to Vauban, and had said that their lifes are so much less stressful than when they did own a car. Mothers can let their childrens to play in the streets without thinking that a car is going to kill them, and kids can let go technology if their moms want them to play outside; most of the kids are so attached to technology because it is a way that parents have to keep them away from the streets. Maybe these changes like in Germany were too radicals, but it can start by a day a year like in Bogotá, Colombia where once a year people take a car-free day, being buses and taxis the only ones allowed to produce smog, the violators are charged with 25 dollars fines. Even in the U.S., from 2003 to 2009 young people driving decreased a 23%, young people are considered the most dangerous driving people. There is so much for young people to do that they are not focused on driving, this could be the beginning of a new era, in April 2013 the number of miles per person was equal that in 1995 where the cars where less than right now. There it is even a program in New York promoting car-pooling!

But for example, here in Florida the public transportation is not that good, you actually need a car that drives  you to the bus station and then take the bus; a bus that will let you on a train station, that train station will offer you a ride of an hour to another bus that takes about half an hour to get to your job (if you live in Homestead and work in Miami). That is about three hours just arriving to your job, every day for five days in a row; that is about thirty hours a week, just to get to your job! But if you have a car, those three hours now are one hour, which seems reasonable (and it is still a lot!). If someone lives at Homestead and needs to do something (which is generally at downtown Miami or Doral) you would have to dedicate a whole day just doing it, if you are going in car because the distance between cities are ridiculous, can you imagine if not having it? For doing something you would have to take two days and do it by parts or wake up at the very morning when it is still dark so you can complete everything by the afternoon. So defenetly the car is a primary need.

Analyzing the life style that people at Vauban have, they are less stressed than the average person who owns a car; people starts to be more social with their neighbors because they have to walk everywhere and the faces are the same, so they actually get to know each other. They also got the benefit of a cleaner enviroment because they do not have the daily doses of smog that someone living in a city would have; cars cause the 12% of the contamination in Europe and more than a 50% in the United States. That is a problem that Paris maybe would not be facing right now if they had payed attention to contamination levels. Since World War II, science has been centered on developing new and better cars; can you imagine what would we have right now if some other would center the science in medicicne or something else?. In the United States an 80% of the budget goes to highways while just a 20% goes to public transportation. But, how can people in Bogotá or Vauben survive without cars? The distance between the comercial and suburban areas are close enough so a bus could take you there (just one bus). Defenetly, making the change would be hard due to our attachment to our cars, but little by little we can change or life style.

2ed047c,"Some think that driverless cars are in our future. Others think that driverless cars are, and should stay, merely a product of science fiction. I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea. Driverless cars are not a good idea for several reasons. The first and most obvious reason is safety. A second reason is the large cost of manufacturing these cars. And finally, a third reason we do not need driverless cars in this day and age, is people would forget how to drive a regular car or neglect to even learn if the car drove itself.

The first reason that society does not need driverless cars is safety. Of course, people can argue that if a car were to drive itself, there would be less accidents. It is true that driverless cars could reduce accidents from drunk driving and other impaired states, or just simple driving errors. However, some of these problems are easy to prevent now. It is illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The simple solution is not to do it. Most crashes caused from simple driving mistakes could be prevented as well. The problem is the driver, not the car. In addition, driverless cars would be at an increased risk for technolgical malfunctions causing potentially fatal crashes. As of right now, the technology in driverless cars is only experimental and theoretical. It would take many years to iron out all the bugs, so to speak, to make these cars function properly all the time. As mentioned paragrpah nine of the article, in most of the Unites States, it is illegal to test drive driverless cars. It is illegal for these very reasons. It is illegal because experimenting with that kind of technology is dangerous.

A second reason that driverless cars are not necessary is the unimaginable cost it would be to manufacture these cars. In addition, millions of dollars would be spent first to research and perfect the workings of the driverless cars. Not to mention, driverless cars would probably cost a larger sum of money than regular cars because of the time and cost of manufacturing them. In the past few years, in the United States has been going through a financial crisis. While our economy is now doing better, where would the money to fund these cars come from? In the article, the author mentions building smarter roads for cars. If that was the case, it would cost even more to fund this grand scheme. So much money is spent on paving and repairing roads every year, it would cost so much more to have to change or rebuild all of the roads in the country. In addition, if cars were to drive themselves, many laws would have to be changed for the new cars. Right now in the United States, one in five children will go hungry, there are clearly more important things to spend money on right now than to fund driverless cars.

A third and final reason that we do not need driverless cars is if we did, people would forget how to drive a regular car, or neglect to even learn. The article mentions that cameras might be needed to ensure people pay attention to the road. There are already enough distractions for drivers to worry about. Texting and driving has become a major issue in recent years. Imagine how easy it would be to be distracted by a phone or other device if the car you were in were driving itself? This is a slippery slope. It starts out with relatively small things, such as not paying full attantion to the road if the car drove itself. But soon, if people did not have to worry about traffic laws and safety, then they would soon forget them. Hypothetically speaking, what if someone who had been driving a driverless for a period of time one day had to go back to driving a regular one. This person may still have their liscense, but would they be able to pass a test for it now? Problems like this would make the road more dangerous than it already is. In addition, that same person who is now driving a regular car, may forget that he or she is controlling the car, being that they were so used to the car driving itself. There is enough reckless driving, that we do not nead people operating vehicles with no memory of how to do it! Or people might even neglect to learn how to drive a regular car at all if they depended on a driverless car all the time. If society allowed this to happen, the results could be catastrophic.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. Maybe in the distant future if more problems that we are currently dealing with are resolved, but not at this time. Driverless cars are not currently safe, and will not be for many years to come. They would cost a significant amount of money, money that can be spent elsewhere for better causes, especially when we already have cars that work perfectly fine. Finally, driverless cars are not a good idea because they could cause people to forget how to drive a regular car, which could lead to a very dangerous and potentially deadly situation. There are benefits of driverless cars, however there are even more downfalls to the idea that certainly outweigh the benefits.      ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

2f095a0,"The electoral college is a very controversial topic.  It has been debated by important figures like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole (Plumer).  While some people agree with Bradford Plumer and say that we should abolish this method, others stand behind Richard A. Posner, wanting to keep the electoral college.  Although the electoral college restores some of the weight in larger states, it is a very unfair method for voting on our president.  The electoral college allows someone to win the presidency who did not win the popular vote, and, if a tie occurs, the outcome is demeaning to larger states.

The electoral college does have a favorable trait.  It restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution (Posner). The senate only appoints 2 representatives per state, no matter how large their populations are.  The electoral college gets rid of this problem, assigning representitives to states based on population.

While that aspect of the electoral college is beneficial, it may be the only thing.  The electoral college is an extremely unfair method.  Just take the 2000 election, for instance.  Al gore won the popular vote but, thanks to this flawed method of selecting our president, lost the presidency (Plumer).  This was uncalled for.  If someone wins the popular vote and is wanted as president by the majority of people, then they should be president.  Our president is a position of the utmost importance.  We should have a leader that the majority of the people want.

Not only is the actual process unfair, but if there ever happens to be a tie it's even worse.  In the event of a tie in the electoral vote, the election is passed on to the House of Representatives, who then have the state delegations vote on the president (Plumer).  However, the catch is that each state gets only one vote (Plumer).  This means that the single represenative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters (Plumer).  This process is extremely unequal and should not be allowed.  Everyone should be able to have equal representation and play a part in critical decisions like this one.

All in all, the electoral college is unfair and people despise it.  According to a poll in 2000, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now (Plumer).  The electoral college, while it may restore some of the weight in larger states, is detested all across the United States.  The person with the popular vote doesn't always win, and, in the event of a tie, the process is even more unfair than the actual method itself. The electoral college is an awful process that the majority of people don't want.  So why is it still here?            ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

307b540,"Dear Florida Senator,

The ongoing debate of whether or not the Electoral College process is fair or unjust is always around you, I presume. I would like to give some personal feedback in the matters of this situation.

I understand that the Electoral College was created in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. (Source 1) However it is not a fair or even equal compromise. The people hardly have any political voice in this aspect. The electors that in return vote for the people generally aren't chosen by the people, the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. (Some state laws vary) (Source 1) If you faithfully are going to vote for the Presidential candidate of your choice, you should be able to have faith in your vote. Those in favor of the Electoral College could make the remark that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...""(Source 3) In the world of reality people don't just want make a comment and expect no reaction, people want to be heard. This is similar to voting, people want their vote to count toward the candidate of their choice not the electors for the candidate.

This then runs into the problem of unfaithful electors. Their votes are never for sure. Although they claim to have ""trust that is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3) you can never be a hundred percent sure in the electors. ""Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Source 2) If this happens the popular vote actually wouldn't go to the thought candidate.

""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" (Source 2) In a case of a tie the vote would go to the House of Representatives. This means that each state would only be able to cast one vote. This is not a smart backup plan. It is not fair for states of different population sizes to have one vote- basically being categorized as one. Proportionally it is not right for a state who represents 500,000 such as Wyoming to recieve the same number of equally weighted votes as a state who represents 35 million such as California. (Source 2)

The Electoral College also follows the ""Winner-take-all"" method. This means that most in most elections the focus is on the swing states or toss up states, all the efforts go to these states. Even though ""the voters are most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", as said by those who believe in the Electoral College (Source 3) what about the voters who have been faithful all along? How can you expect them to feel when they barely get noticed? Those are the ones the candidates should be thanking and having gratitute toward because they are the ones who will be supporting them and their campaign.

I know that politics are filled with misconceptions and many confusing roles and aspects but please consider my thoughts and words. I speak for the voiceless and my fellow neighbors, but most importantly I speak for what our government was founded upon, WE THE PEOPLE.

Sincerely,

308be53,"Why The Facial Action Coding System Is Irrelevant

Sometimes people have bad days, and it can have a huge impact on others, but only if people choose to show it. Human emotion can be displayed in many ways. Some ways emotion can be expressed are through body language and facial movements/changes. However one chooses to show their emotion is all their decision, and it does not need to be known by everyone else. The Facial Action Coding Sytem is not valuable because it is a person's own choice to decide whether or not they want someone else to know how they are feeling, emotions are not relevant to students in a classroom, and there are not many ways that knowing emotions can benefit people in their careers.

A person's emotions do not involve other people. Although emotions can be caused by others, emotions do not have to be known by others. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", by Nick D'Alto, the author states ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" If a person can already make a guess on how someone may be feeling on their own, why would they need The Facial Action Coding System? This would be an actual waste of technology because it would be doing a natural job that a human can do on their own.

Students in a classroom are there for learning about subjects such as math, science, language arts, and social studies, neither of which involves emotions. Bringing The Facial Action Coding System into a classroom would be more distracting than helpful. Students and teachers should be focused more on the lesson than how one is feeling during it. In the article, it says that A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" In this case, students could also become very playful with the technology and trick it to access unreliable feedback.

Knowing emotions may benefit pychologists when wanting to understand the true feelings of one of their patients in a career based setting. However, in a classroom setting, reading student's emotional expressions is not needed. Some students may not enjoy school, but they are still required to go. The article notes that Dr. Huang adds Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This means that not only would The Facial Action Coding System be able to read the emotions of students, but it would also takeover the job of being a teacher. This is a disadvantage for teachers since they are there to answer any questions and do the lesson planning. This would also put many teachers out of a job.

There are very few benefits, there is no relevance for knowing the emotions of students, and any emotions of a person may not want to be detected, therefore The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable. Technology is supposed to be beneficial to humans and make life easier. The Facial Action Coding System does the opposite of that. Emotions should be revealed through a person's own wish, not through a computer. This could make many people very angry, due to the programming of this technology. The goal behind The Facial Action Coding System may be to read emotional expressions, but the emotions created, by people, from being able to do so could become very upsetting.

308e4ca,"Driverless cars are a dangerous thing that this society doesn't need. Driverless cars aren't completley driverless. They just stop doing their own thing as soon as they need the human help, this could cause accidents, tragic deaths, and lots of money from whoever is responsible. Are driverless, safe, cars really possible?

In 2009 the first ""driverless"" car could drive under specific conditions. It even drove ""half a million miles without a crash"". They still require a human driver to take over whenever pulling in and out of driveways. The driver also has to drive whenever there is roadwork or accidents, because the driverless cars aren't capable of figuring out where to go by themselves. The awesome cars on tv that drive all by themselves with no probelm really aren't a reality for us.

Some have hope that one day driverless cars may really happen, because of how far we've come with research and improvements. In the 1950s General Motors made a car that could drive on a special track, but the tracik was imbedded with electrical cable. This sent radio waves to the car to help direct it. Berkeley engineers tried something like this, they made it so the car could read positive and negative polarity in binary code. These experiments worked really well, but in order for that to work around the world we would have to upgrade every exsisting road. That's way to expensive and quite frankly to much to ask for such a new kind of technology.

In order to have driverless cars without changing every road in the world they would need lots of sensors. One sensor on the reer wheel, roof, rearview mirror, gps, inertial motion, and four automotive radar sensors. The combination of these sensors is supposed to mimic the skills of a human driving. We've used speed sensors before in the 1980s to create antilock brakes. These sensors over the time span of ten years became so advanced that they can detect out of control skids or rollovers.

In 2013 BMW developed a new car that has traffic jam assistance, they say the car can handle speeds up to 25 mph, but the car still requires the driver to keep hold of the wheel. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. These cars have been givent he ability to steer, accelerate, and bake themselves, but they all still need a driver to alert when they can no longer handle the situation. The driver has to remain alert at all times, and be ready to take over at a moments notice. Manufacturers are considering using cameras insure the driver is watching the road while the car watches the driver.

Some manufacteres and drivers are afraid that the driver will get bored with only being able to drive half of the time. So they want to provide these cars with in-car entertainment, but still have a way to inform the driver that they need to take over, and will instantly shut the entertainment off. Traffic laws are made so that a car being driven by a human is the only safe way because they have control at all times. Some states fear accidents so they have banned even test driving these cars. These states would include California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia.

Even if traffic laws were to change, new laws would still be needed. These laws would need to cover liability in case the car got into an accident, because the new technology failed. If that were to happen people fear there would be huge fights over who is responsible for the damage. The manufacter or the person who was ""driving."" Telsa believes the 2016 project will be sucessful because they are creating a car that has the ability to drive 90 percent of the time. Still the car is not driverless.

Driverless cars are more harm than they are good. Sure they may save money on gas, but they would require a lot more attention than a normal car. Driving in a normal car you know you have to be alert all the time. In a ""driverless"" car you don't, but If it were me i'd be more alert because i'd be afraid that all of a sudden the car isn't going to handle what's going on and turn the responsibility over to me. This would cause lots of stress and anxiety whenever trying to drive. Driverless cars just aren't something we need. ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

309bd04,"Facial expressions and emotions drive the actions of people everyday. These emotions are sometime hidden, fake or very transparent. I believe that using this Facial Action Coding System in class rooms, will be quite valuable to the learning enviroment and education of idividuals. It will increase learning efficiancy, focus in the class room, and productivity of the students.

The Facial Action Coding System essentially scans your face for emotion and makes decisions based on the results. This would be very valuable in a classroom especially those of younger students and gradeschool. During school students can be unmotivated to learn, bored or confused in the classroom. These problems can waste time and cause students to not fully understand and learn the topic.

If this system can produce the outcome predicted this will lessen the amount of time, and help students to understand the topic more and at a quicker rate. By moving at the students speed and manipulating the lessen at points where the student is confused can be more efficient than the classrooms now. This system will eliminate the wasted time, bordem and provide solutions for those confused.

As well as increasing the efficiency, this sytstem can also benefit the classroom enviroment. When students become bored or unmotivated, they can become a distraction in the classroom. Teachers then have to take time to meet the need the student has. This disruption in the class can catch the attention of other students and cause them to stop working and or act as the other student is. Distractions like these cause learning to be hindered and if eliminated it can better the learning enviroment for teachers and students. This system, can keep students active and motivated to learn, providing less of a chance to be a distraction.

Furthermore, if distraction, bordem and unmotivation is eliminated or improved in the classroom enviroment, this can increase productivity. Students when bored or unmotivated essentially stop working, and students who are confused work at a slower pace. These problems cause the work that needs to be done, not completed or completed slower than neccessary. This system can keep the attention of students and create a path that the student learns at their own rate, thus completing the work that needs to be done ontime or quicker. This can benefit the classroom because teachers do not need to review topics that some students might have understood but others have not.

In conclusion this system is the most efficient, productive and helpful tool that a class room could be aquipped with. It eliminates bordem and unmotivation, causes more efficient learning and allows productivity in the classroom to increase. All teachers should implement this tool in their classroom if presented the opportunity. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

30b779e,"What the Facial Action Coding System is a "" process begins whe the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more mucles is called a ""action unit."" The man thing is weather or not this ""Facial Action Coding Syste"" should be used to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valube . But there can be some good things about this and there can be some bad things about this. The pros is id the computer can read if the kid is strugling with somthing and the teacher could come help the kid. Also the computer can read if the kid is depressed and needs help with somthing going on in his or her life. The cons isinvasion of privice. But with all these pros and cons I think we should have the ""Facical Actions Coding System"".

My first reason why we should have these computers is for school. In the artical the author says ""A classroom computer could recognizewhen a student is becoming confused or bored."" What this means if a kid is stuggling or confused the computer can read that the kid is in need of help on the thing he is working on and the teacher can come help the kid. Also the good thing is if the kid is confused and needs help, but if the kid is shy or scared to ask qustions the computer can tell the teacher he or she needs help on what they are working on. Last if the computer knows the person in confused the computer can stop what the kidis doing and help that person on what they are doing. This is my first reason on why we need this computer system in all schools.

My second reason is the computer can read kids emotions and can help the person. "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of corse, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This shows if a person is depressed and needs help but is scared to tell anybody the conputer can tell that friend so that friend can help that person out. Also this can tell if a person is angry and the actions that person could do when they are angry helping that person out and other people around them, beacuse of the actions that person can do while they are mad. Last this device can save lifes of people who think of suicide beacuse the computer can warn peopel these sighns helping the person out and many more people. This is my second reason why all schools should have the computer system.

My third and last reason is the computer can help that person be happy if they are sad and depressed. According to Facial Feedback Theoryof Emotions"" Putting on a happy face actually works!"" Also "" imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnt."" What this is saying is if you are watching somthing and ad comes on and it makes you happy the computer know that you like if and it would more like that. But if a ad comes on you dont like it and frown the computer knows that and will change it fast so you stay happy. With this computer doing that it could keep a lot of kid happy. This is my third reason why all schools should have this computer system.

Some people my not agree with me. Some people may say that it is advading your privace. But I think the computer should beacuse the computer can svae lives. Also help kids learn. Last it can keep kids happyand not sad. With the computer doing all of this we can keep a healthy life style and a safer envoroment for every body. This is why all schools should have this computer system to save lifes, help kids, and keep kids happy.",5,3.0,3.0,,":

30be42a,"Driverless cars are revolutionizing the auto industry. This idea behind this futuristic technology is to allow the user to relax and not be bothered by the worries of the road. While this idea sounds nice in concept, when put into reality it just becomes illogical. It is for this reason that unless groundbreaking technology is discovered that can make driverless cars safe and practical, people should just continue to drive cars themselves.

One of the specific faults of driverless cars is the fact that they are not truly driverless. This is made evident when the author states that ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" (7). The whole purpose of developing computurized cars is so that no attention is required by the humans within the cars. If the human still has to be ""alert"" and ready to drive, then the entire point of having these automated cars is negated. The attention required by a human takes away from the ability to relax and not worry about the road. To that point, if the operator of the vehicle is not able to fully relax, he/she would much rather be solely operating the vehicle for the strict purpose of keeping occupied. If they cannot risk leaving the car alone to occupy themselves with other things, than the entire purpose of the driverless car has been defeated.

Another factor that argues against driverless cars is the issue of safety. While some may argue that the automation of the car takes away the factor of human error, this puts too much trust in the computers. While tested, and proven safe, it is still worrysome to think about the fact that the operator's life is solely in the driving skill of the computer that is driving the car. It is unrealistic to put this much trust into a computer preforming a predominantly human activity. Human knowlege, reactions, and skill are all key attributes in driving, which is why taking these attributes away may turn out to be dangerous. This is the reason that ""...in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"" (9). Things are not just made illegal without ample reason to do so. Clearly the United States government, the most powerful government in the world believes that there is too much risk involved in testilng, nonetheless driving these furutistic automobiles.

This idea of driverless cars follows the recent social trend of laziness. As a species we are beginning to rely more and more on computers to complete simple tasks that we are more than capable of completing ourselves. There is a point where technology is taken too far and that is the point where it has an opportunity to impact our safety. This is that point.

30c1119,"Dear state senator,

My letter is in regards to changing the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that we, the people, should have the opportunity to choose whom we wish to become President.

The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote. It's a big deal for people to go out and take action. So what would make the electoral college change one view of voting? Its the fact that we aren't really voting for our president. We are voting for our electors of the state, to vote for our president. And on top of that, there are still many people out there who don't have a clue that their actually voting for someone in our state to decide for us. Although the electoral college does help make the presidential election less complicated, it's the mere fact that WE aren't making much of a difference.

The electoral college doesn't only have a few minor set backs, but it could tarnish out dreams of who we wanted to be president by way more than we could've expected. When it comes to voting for electors, its a difficult thing when it comes to how many electors represent which political party. Democrat, or Republican. Say one wanted the one candidate running for president to win, and he/she were Republican. That person would go out and cast a vote for a slate of however many of republican electors there are for that state. The part that gets a lot of people is that there could be fewer Republican electors then there are Democrat electors. Say one still wanted the Republican candidate to win and they voted in their residential state which was Nevada. IF Nevada had 4 Republican electors then that meant anyone who voted for the Democrat electoral wasn't chipping in much to the election. In the end, all the electors votes are counted for each side, and because Nevada had only two dedicated Democrats, the chances of the Democrat candidate having less electoral votes then the Republican candidate, has increased. If this problem happenes for several other states, then the chances double, even triple.

If this doesn't make you think that the electoral college should go, then think again. The electoral college is definitely unfair to voters. Any chance of unfaithful electors, could happen. It could make one feel betrayed that they voted foe a specific elector to do one job. Which was to help select the president the voter wanted. Whats the point in putting your trust in someone who could just easily turn around and NOT vote who you wanted? There is no point. But that's what we're doing when we vote. We are making it an option for that to happen. So why not vote by popular vote? Why not avoid all the issues the electoral college can cause for us? We should be lucky that back in '00, that was the biggest election crisis and it COULD'VE been worse.

In conclusion, we the people, should have the opportunity to vote and actually have our vote counted. Because every state doesnt't have the sam eamount of people in each, the chances of there being a tie in the presidential election, is slightly unlikely. Other then there being a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the votes add up tp 538; an even number. We shouldn;t put ourselves through this, and truth be told, the election is confusing as it is. I say, we should get rid of the electoral college. It's not needed, and a pain.                         ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

30ff0f0,"The year is 2041, and astronaut Jeff Goudard has just landed in the region of Cydonia. He is extremly exited becouse he will be the first human to see the only alien artifact known to man. As soon as he lands, he sees the face. Jeff's jaw drops practically to his feet. He relizes the ""Face on Mars"" is really just a plain old mesa, just like the ones out in the American West. Now just like this astronaut, there are probably hundreds of people that think that the ""Face on Mars"" is some sort of alien monuent, but in reality science and logical thinking has proven that in reality, the ""Face on Mars"" is really just a Mesa almost identical to the ones found out in the American West.

First off is the logical thinking portion. In the region of Cydonia mesas are incredibly common.

Now this particular mesas is oddly shapped, I will give it that, but it is just a mesa. What gives it human fetures is just the shadows. Just look at 1976 Viking one photograph. You can clearly see shadows Just look slightly below it, you can see a long shadow protruding from the mesa. Now on the flip side, look at the picture captured on 1998 when it was cloudy out and there were no shadows at all. The image just makes it look like a weird rock, not like a human face at all.

While still on the topic of the photographs, the one snapped on 2001 also proves that the so called ""Face on Mars"" is really just a mesa becouse of not the actual formation, but the surronding area. It was taken by a very high quality camera. In fact, it's pixles spanned 1.56 meters whereas the best Viking photograph the pixles spanned 43 meters. That ment that you could zoom in around the area of the mesa to scan if there was any other evidence of alien life. So scienteists and analysts could scan the sourrounding area for pyramids or buildings, but they found absolutly nothing that would sugest that aliens are present in the region.

Lastly, lets all say that the so called face really was an ancient alien structure, why would NASA keep it a secret. I mean, NASA is really short on funding, but if it was proven that there was aliens on Mars, then that would mean NASA funding probaly would go through the roof. What better goal could NASA have then to make conatact with extratrestrialls. This must mean that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another mesa. What organization would pass up the opprotunity to get through the roof funding.

So just face the facts. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a mesa that had well placed shadows that are one in a million. So don't be Jeff the astronaut, and just face the facts early on as oposed to having high hopes and dreams just to have them crushed by even more scientifically proven evidence. If you don't remember anything from this article, remember this: don't be Jeff.",5,3.0,3.0,,,", and awkward phrasing, hinder the overall clarity and effectiveness of the writing.

31c2e4e,"To the State Senate,

Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popular-based vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fufilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, ""...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"" (3). This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place"" (Office of the Federal Register, 1). This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well.

According to Plumer, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" (2). This indicates how the tie could carry the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement takes place of voting for the president. Not only this, but Plumer also stated,""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" (2). This statement from Plumer strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House of Representatives would hardly reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gore recieved a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fair? This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumer stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters...swing states..."" (2). This brings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winner-take-all system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance of winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer,2). This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed.

Now, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the ""...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone's President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid Run-Off Elections..."" (Posner, 3). These subtitles are points that Posner focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winner-takes-all method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" (3). In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Run-off Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (3). I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President?    ",5,3.0,,,":**

32ad275,"There are so many advantages of limiting car usage. In source one, the Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"". This is for the good of not cluttering the streets with so many cars but actually making more space and less cars on the streets. In source one, it says ""while there hace been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the cocept to the suburbs."" That right there says they have been trying to reduce car usage for a while now and convince citizens that transportation can be better to use. Instead of having over a million cars on the streets or high ways or anywhere, many people can come together and take transportation train or bus to where ever they need to go. It also makes time for walking, which is a very good exercise. Many people have become lazy and take their car to drive to the store thats right there on the corner instead of walking. Many people have taken car usage over the limits and don't realize how it is polluting our air.

Pollution is a big problem in our ecosystem now and days. Many people don't clearly see this and don't take the time to process in how bad its making earth. Pollution has gone up over the years and decades after decades we have tried to stop it. In source two, it says ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" Why? Well because of the exaggerated use of cars. They have tried to reduce the usage in order to make their air cleaner and better. They have gotten the idea of limiting car usage by ordering people with even-numbered license plates to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine on Mondays. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. With this new policy, it has shown better air in the city of Paris by Monday. I believe this is a great forced rule. We need to change our ways and work better in making our air cleaner.

Traffic jams is another downfall of using cars. With so many cars out in the streets it causes the air to have so much smog. Many people have participated in bike riding and walking, but not only is it exercise for your health but it keeps away from people using their cars. With so many people participating this action, not only has it made better air burt also constructed and cropped up new restaurants and shopping districts. They cleared the side walk to make it smoother and cut traffic, as said in source three. This is all in Bogota, Columbia. They said it has made a drastic change in their community with better air and I believe it has made their air better and way reduced smog.

In the United States, President Obama's goal was to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to many people participating in this action. A very big amount of Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and fewer licences as each year goes by as said in source four. To keep this at a going rate each year I believe citizens should work harder to improve more in this situation as in car pooling, bicycle and public transportation.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages in reducing car usage. Better air, better community and healthier citizens.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

32aedc2,"Changing The Future

Times are changing. Driverless car technology is being created, with slow and steady progress. The technology for these type of cars has only been developed over the last few years because of a lack of technology. There are several companies trying to develop these cars, but they're pretty much at the same step. Knowing how driverless technology works, who is liable for damages, and how it will effect drivers is crucial to the possible future use of driverless cars.

Driverless technology has to be understood by the consumer. If the consumer does not know how this technology works, it could cause some serious damage.

The consumer has to realize that driverless cars aren't completely driverless, the consumer has to know that they have to remain attentive while being in the driver's seat. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" (Driverless Cares Are Coming paragraph 7). Without the realization that they have to be attentive, some bad accidents could occur.

Liability for the accidents caused by driverless cars has to be settled. The companies that make the driverless cars, or the driver, it is yet to be determined who would be at fault. The company for making flawed technology, or the driver for being in the car. ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturere?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 9). This will be a huge issue if driverless cars do become legal. Driverless cars could effect the people in more way than one.

The effect of drivers in the future if cars become driverless. Their is a great possibility of issues coming with driverless cars, some subtle, and some severe. Also, who would want a driverless car if you still had to driver it? That does defeat the purpose of the name of the car. ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 8). Being occupied while sitting there is imperative. People will become bored if they have to just sit in the seat all day long. Companies have to come of with entertainment systems, but an issue with that is losing attention. While being in the driver's seat of a driverless car, being attentive is imperative. There may be situations where the car cannot handle it, and it requires human skills. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 7). There is a double whammy right there. Companies have to balance out occupying the driver and keeping them attentive; but there is no way to be distracted and attentive at the same time.

The risks involved with driverless cars are way to high for the potential payoff. The technology that is being developed might have a future, but in the near future, there is no way it'll work. Right now, they aren't even driverless cars, the cars still require a driver. Surely there will be progress on that aspec of the cars. Just simple knowing how the cars work is the first obsticle. Also, being able to figure out who is liable for damages between the manufacturer, or the driver of the car is a huge issue that comes with this. Lastly, how it will effect future driver's skills, and attentiveness while driving. Will there be a future in this industry, or not? Only time will tell.

32d692d,"Using the same technology configured using the Facial Action Coding System into school technology would be a valuable tool in the classroom because the often hidden signals or vibes students show can often give teachers mixed feelings about the effectiveness of their lessons or how student are being treated emotionally by others, but this is still something that we must not make this something that interfears or plays with the personal feelings of the students. It would be a valuable addition to any classroom for its in-depth look into how the information is reaching the students, how they are reacting, and what the teacher can do differently to get the most out of thier lesson plans.

Especially in the mornings and end of the day, students' laziness, tiredness, or anticipation to get home can often disturb with how teachers percieve how their lesson plans are effecting the child. With the same Facial Action Coding System in our own school computers, online activities and assignments can track the emotional responses of the students while they work such as their attentiveness. Since this technology is, ""compared against a neutral face"", teachers will be able to witness firsthand their student's reactions. Oftentimes, early morning weariness or late school day excitement can fool the teacher's perception of the situation, but with the analyzing of the six basic emotions using ""video imagery"" of the, ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"", this technology would be able to offer to give an accurate conclusion to the student's reactions to each lesson.

Another commonly addressed situation is when students become ""confused or board"" with an assignment; both of these natural reactions show that the challenge level is not suited to the student's level. Teachers often want to offer help to the confused and challenge or entice board students, but these emotions are often not shown to the human eye. Especially with confused students, they hide this sense of confusion from the teacher to avoid embarassment. However, with this new technology, students who need more attention can be noticed. With the software's facial recogntion using minor muscle movements, it can make a conclusion without the student fully showing the emotion. With this in depth look, teachers are able to provide tutoring for those who need extra explaination and modify of their lessons for individuals who are not finding interest or challenge in the current lesson. With this technology, teachers will be able to realize how challenged each student needs to be even when they put up a ficade.

Another way that this teachnology can offer help to the students is with the daunting and huge school problem of bullying and depression before it leads to events much more serious. Since this technology picks up on feelings such as fear or saddness, these indications could be the first warning signs of when a student is taking their first steps into one of these two situations. Such as with the example of politicians and celebrities, even fake smiles are attributes will be able to be seen through. This is a serious problem in our day and age, so if these signs are reported reguarly and continuously, this may be the closest a student comes to calling for help. With this information not being able to be tricked through false emotions, students can recieve the mental and emotional help or stability they need.

Despite this great new innovation as well as all of the new data teachers can gather on their methods of teaching, we must ensure that this technology does not dive into the personal emotions students want to keep to themselves. Because many schools are now having take-home Chromebooks or Ipads, the school board needs to make sure that the students have thier own emotional security when at home. Teachers need to be careful and be reminded that there is a boundery between checking up with these emotional resonces for lesson planning and interfearing with the student's personal life. Otherwise, stuents will feel insecure both in and out of school because their core emotions such as a recent breakup might be revealed.

Facial Action Coding Systems for schools would allow teachers and students to more understand each side's perspective, so the students can be helped to the fullest extent they can be taught. This simple idea is building off of the simple idea of everyday empathy into the perspective of our school technology. This new technology would come with a pricetag, but being able to more effectively teach in the classroom would be well worth the money. Human emotions can be a difficult factor to implicate seen with examples such as the varying emotions with The Mona Lisa, but this technology will allow us to revolutionize our schools into an education build by the reactions of students and the lesson modifications of teachers.

3323064,"Dear Mr. senator

The Electoral college process consists of 538 electors. Each elector represents a state and they vote according to what the majority of the people favor. The Electoral college is a fair and honest way of electing the president because each individual has a voice in who is elected by voting for the state electors .""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors""(Does the Electoral College Work?). This shows how everyone plays a key role in the government and in electing the main person in charge.

Many people may argue that the Electoral college is corrupt because it is a ""non-democratic"" way of electing a president and that the electors may not vote in favor of the people's majority. This is true, however,""that trust is rarely betrayed""(Does the Electoral College Work?)."" It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national poular vote""(Does the Electoral College Work?), but this too has rarely happened. We need to continue with the Electoral college process despite a couple rarely occuring cons because all of the reasons to retain this fair system heavily outways the negative. There are five main arguements to continue the use of this justified system.

The first reason is ""certainty of outcome."" A conflict over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is rare and less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. "" The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote""(Does the Electoral College Work?). A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is also highly unlikely to occur.

This second argument is ""Everyone's president."" ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal""(Does the Electoral College Work?). This is so the residents of other regions don't feel deserted and that their votes don't count. Every president should have this desirable result so that he/she can be a successful president.

The third main argument is ""Swing States."" ""The winner-take-all mathod of awarding eletoral votes induces the canidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states....voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign""(Does the Electoral College Work?). These electoral voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters and should be able to decide the election.

The fourth reason to retain the Electoral College system is that ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states(by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution""(Does the Electoral College Work?). A large state would get more attention than a small state and I think that this is fair because the larger states by population should get more votes because they contain more people.

The fifth and final reason that we as a nation should favor the Electoral College is because it ""avoids run-off elections.""The Electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast""(Does the Electoral College Work?). The Electoral College takes the huge pressure off of run-off elections and clearly produces a winner.

I hope that you take into consideration what I said and help the Electoral College continue to thrive over the years because without this system the nation will be in a big dispute. I know that this is the best system for our country and state and I strongly hope that you see that too.

33504eb,"In the article ""Driverless Care Are Coming"" the author presents to the reader a set of positive and negatibe aspects of driveless cars. The driveless cars are cars that do not need a huamn to drive/control the wheel while on the road. These cars are able to drive for you, and give you a better way of getting places safer and more effective. There are problems as well with the cars; shown in the paragrapghs below, you will see why driverless cars are not the future of cars.

""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" made many great points on why driverless cars are a good for the people in the world, but they also stated some very good points on why it would not be. For example, in the article it says the cars are very expensive due to the work that would have to be done to the roads and the cars themselves for them to work corectly. In paragraph four it states ""For starters, they needed a while lot of sensors."" meaning that the car itself would need more added to make sure it was effective which technically cost more money. Not only is money an issue but the fact that driverless cars will taking the skill of driving away from people. As you get older you start to learn how to drive and get to learn all of the rules of the road, but with a driverless car you will most likely not have to learn how to drive. Not knowing how to drive leads to not learning the rules of the road which will lead to more accidents and lawsuits.

Drivelss cars are the future of cars. Yes, maybe, but as said in the article they still have not found a fully effective driveless car the does not need the help of a human when it comes close to danger or something unfamiliar. As said in paragraph seven ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driveless."" this shows that even with more developed technology they still have not made a fully effective driverless car. The whole point of a driverless car is so the person behind the wheel techinically does not have to drive. Another example is that the drivers must stay alert whcih makes the car even less of a big deal because as said before, the car is not technically driverless. If they want these cars to be the future they need to develope a truly effective car, not just a semi-effecive car.

Another reason why the driverless car is not a car that should be made is because with a driverless car there is no one technically to blame for an acident because the car was not driven by anyone but itself. In paragraph nine the article says ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver of the manufacturer?"" this shows the car is only made to drive not to protect what is beyond. The manufacturer should be more invested on how to change the fact that it will not be one- hundred percent and change how safe the car actually is. An example that brought attention was in paragraph ten when the author of the article said ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percebt of the time"" still shows how the car is not truly a driverless car which means that the car name itself is false advertising. That wilol also lead to lawsuits becasue it is not what the consumer/buyer was looking for when they heard the name ""driverless car"".

The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" made many great points on why or why not a driverless car is a good car. Reading the article there were many points that stood out about why the car would not be a good car, than to why it would be a good car. To sum up the driverless car is a car that still is not always effective which can bring harm to the people inside of the car and the people beyond the car. Driverless cars are taking away the fact that as a person driving is a skill you must learn, not just get it handed to you because you have a ""driverless"" car. To conclude the driverless car is not a good car and more people should not support the idea.             ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

3496a0a,"False Face on Mars

For some decades people have been spark with the idea of an acient civilization/aliens on Mars for a while due to Viking 1 capturing a picture of what seem to be a face on Mars. Hollywood movies, commercial, comics, and etc commercial things have fill the minds of many people with flase accusation. The saying of don't always beleive what you see or hear is true in this situation. There are many reason why this information is false. And I as a scientist at NASA will give you reason and facts on why it is flase.

The truth is there is no face on Mars. If there were face on Mars there would be many more sign of life and ancient artifact or buildings from ages ago. Just like in Earth there were many sign leading to ancient civilization such as the Inca, Maya, Aztec, and Egytian. This civilization had proof such as ruins, artifact, and fossil leading to it, but there weren't any sign of any of those in Mars instead there was just an asume face . As one can see here with just an asume face on Mars so it was unlikely that an aliens/other being did it.

A person might claim that scientists could be hiding fact from people so they don't find out the truth about the face like an alien actually making the face. I as a scientist would have already known report or leaked if some scientist were hiding something. Scientist love to share facts or truth, it is their second nature. And it is our responsibility to tell you guys about new fascinating discover we made not hide it. And this proof that is it would be pointless for scientist to hide the truths from people.

One of the most vauble reason is that the picture was taken in the 1900s. At the time the camera qualities and technowlogy weren't as advance as nowdays. The article state that there were three perfect shot of the picture taken one from 1976, 1998, and 2001. there is abig difference in each of these shot. In the 1976 picture it show a picture of what seem to be a face but later on in the 1998 picture it show a disoriented face or landform. Then in the last picture in 2001 it show a martian or a natural landform such as one that is in Earth. The qualities in these has much difference as the 2001 one being the most advance. The face also was effect by shadow from Mars, as state in the article that the dark color for the eys and nose plus mouth of the face image was cause by shadow from an angle in Mars due to the camera not being able to take a perfect angle of the martian. And all these fact are poiting out that the face on Mars is a false information.

With information scientist have been gathering and finding an alien being or an acient civilization on Mars is a dead end. The media is have a great effect on the people minds leading them to not see the truth that the face on Mars is a very false idea coming from the people minds, Now that the facts has been out to public people are agreeing with the scientist more and more. Thus all these facts and research from scientists leading to that the Face on Mars is FALSE but just a martian landform.                 ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

34ad8eb,"Ah, the electoral college. Don't you just

LOVE

how irrelevent, unfair, and confusing it is? In fact, it is so without flaw, that in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but he lost the presidency (Source 2). Some people say that the electoral college is an anachronism, but some people disagree. Those people are wrong. The electoral college was irritating in the 1960's, and it's irritating now. You should side with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce (Source 2), and abolish the electoral college.

First, and most importantly, the electoral college is unfair to voters . Most states in the electoral college is based on a ""winner take all"" system; if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors (Source 1). This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after ""swing states"" (Source 2).  If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win (Sources 1 and 3). Voters for the electoral college say that people in the swing states are going to pay closer attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters (Source 3),  but should 10% of the nation decide who runs your country?!

The second virus causing the electoral college to convulse and bite its tongue in half is what happens in the event of a tie. If this is to occurr, then state delegates in the House of Represenatatives decide the President (Source 2). Each state only casts one vote, so the representative from Rhode Island would have just as much to say as the 55 representatives from the state of California (Source 1 and 2). Not only that, but a majority of people vote one party for president and another for Congress (Source 3). There are 538 possible votes in the electoral college (Source 1), so it isn't impossible for a tie to happen. In 1976, if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had switched candidates, there would have been a tie (Source 2).

And finally, the last thing that makes the electoral college as relevant as a new wheel for your horse and buggy is that, it's mind-bogglingly confusing. The electoral college is run by humans, so we must account for human error. The electors are just people chosen by the candidate who don't hold a seat in government (Sources 1 and 2). In 1960, a group of racists in Louisiana almost replaced Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, and he would have lost the election (Source 2). In Hawaii, also in 1960, two slates of electors were sent (Source 3). Faithless electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for anyone else (Source 2).

In conclusion, the electoral college is literally pointless. It's unfair and confusing. If America had decided on a majority rules electoral system, and not this pile of trash, we would still have all the same presidents we did before. Well, except Al Gore.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

357c8cc,"I disagree with with having driverless cars because of possible technology issues, anxiety, and who would be held accountable if the car crashes. There are way too many questions that cannot be answered when it comes to these cars. Also i honestly think risk of death while in one of these cars is a lot higher than an actual human driver.

If driverless cars actually came to be then that would mean they would have to implant several radars and motion systems in each and every car they create, accroding to paragragh four. Also in paragraph four it says all of these systems are necessary to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. If they have to install of these system just to mimic a human's skill, then how much more technonlogy do you think they are going to need to actually avoid as many wrecks as humans. The creation of the driverless car is to lower the rate of car crashes. If they are using all of this technology just to mimic a human behind the wheel, then all of the hard work would be pointless because the rate of car crashes is not going to change if the driverless car is just like human behind the wheel. Also even if they do create these cars and a small interference takes place, how many cars would it effect and who would the blame fall back on? The driver or the manufacturer.

In paragraph seven it states the will cars have special sensors to make the driver keeps a hold of the wheel. Also it states that the human driver inside of the vehicle would have to remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires them to. This would create anxiety for millions of drivers. The driver would have no clue when they would have to take full control of a moving vehicle and meanwhile other cars are driving on the same street too. I can think of several instances where this could cause easily create a wreck. For example what if the driver decieds to change the radio station it is their turn to take over and they slam on the brakes. The cars behind the driver might also end up wrecking trying to avoid the driver that wanted to go from 96.1 to 106.1 on the radio for a split second while the radars had full control of the car.

My last reason I do not agree with driverless cars is because who would the blame fall on if the cars crashed. How would outsiders know what caused the crash. If there is a crash where both of the drivers are knocked out, then who would be able to talk and remeber what system caused them to crash. In paragraph nine it says if the technology fails and someone gets hurt who is held accountable? This is a very good question that seems to be very hard to answer. Therefore, driverless cars are a bad idea.

In conclusion driverless cars are a very bad idea beacause of possible tech issuses, aniexty, and who would be liable if the car crashes.

35c806d,"Florida Senator:

After reading a few articles explaining the Electoral College system and reading arguements for and against it, I have decided the system is not worth keeping in place. The system does not take every voter into account, and our electors are not always reliable. Also, this system of voting can discourage citizens in non-swing states from voting, which may be it's greatest crime. The Electoral College is worn out and ready for retirement.

The Electoral College, although seemingly based on the people's votes, is really dependent on whoever the chosen electors want as president. It does not seem very fair for voters to spend months listening to drawn out debates, campaign commercials, and becoming educated on the candidates, just to have their vote essentially thrown away if they did not vote for the majority. No, they do not even get to see their vote in action. It is simply erased and given to a slate of electors who stand for the majority of the state, even if the majority is only 50.1%. To the new generation of voters who really want to make a difference in the government, the idea that unless we pick the 'right' candidate for our state, our votes really do not matter is absurd.

In the electoral college system, even the majority voters in each state can not count on having reliable electors, according to Bradford Plumer, the author of an anti-Electoral College-article. Electors can be anyone who does not hold a public office, and these people can be swayed or unloyal to their own party as well (Plumer). These are the people our votes are really going towards, not the actual president as many uneducated could be led to believe. Although the trust of these people is rarely misplaced (Richard A. Posner, In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our present method of choosing the President), there is always a possibility of the electors being swayed at the last minute, which is a bit of a scary thought. Imagine if segregationists in the Loisiana legislature had succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, one of or best presidents (Plumer).

The final reason keeping the Electoral College system in place is a bad idea is that if you are a voter in a clearly defined state, that is, non-swing, you are more likley to decide not to vote at all. When candidates can clearly define states in which they know they will win, or have no hope of winning, they don't bother spending time there to educate voters. Voters in these states do not get all the information they might want in order to make an educated decision. This would lead to a biased, uneducated state in which voters don't care to vote because of a mindset that almost everyone in the state is of a certain political mindset and their vote is just another piece of paper that will not matter. These voters could also make rash decisions because they did not get to truly hear all of the campaignes. In swing states where there is not a clearly defined political opinion, voters will be bombarded with information, and although they may be educated and well versed in their opinions, the votes, no matter how close, will not really matter because of the nature of the Electoral College system.

In closing, the Electoral College system is not worth saving. Although some may argue it gives a certainity of outcome or restores the balance to heavily populated states (Posner), it does not give everyone's vote a fair chance. Nor does it guarantee the electors will be reliable. The Electoral College system even dissuades voters from excercising their Constitutional right to vote. Please take this into consideration, Mr. Senator, next time the Electoral College comes into question. Thank you for recieveing my most humble opinion.

Sincerely,

362a2d1,"Dear Senator,

The process of voting through the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers.  While some say that the Electoral College goes against America's democratic ideals and it increases the probability for a disastrous vote, the Electoral College still gives Ameican citizens some sway in the election and with a completely democratic system of voting there is a good chance that the outcome could be even more disastrous.  The Electoral college is a compromise of voting between citizens and the government, it represents the people as evenly as it can, and it still gives voters a collective chance to change the outcome of an election.

One reason that the Electoral college works so well is that it is not completely run by the people or run by the government.  Rather both are part of the voting process, having equal representation.  While democracy is highly regarded in America, it would be unwise to have a vote completely run by the people.  The government needs to have some system in place that gives citizens a vote, but not complete free reign.  If the people of America voted and the election outcome was disastrous, then the government needs to have a scapegoat in place.  The founding fathers understood this which is why the Electoral College is still in place today.

The Electoral College does not give a single voter a chance to sway an election, however America's population as a whole is represented.  Not one region or state has enough electoral votes to elect a president (Par 19 and 21).  This is a good thing because canidates pay equal attention to all of America's people.  Also, in the Electoral College, not every state has the same amount of electoral votes because every state has a different population size.  This might seem like unequal representation of that states, but the election is not meant to give each state an equalized vote, it is meant to give the population of america an even representation.

Swing states give America's people a chance to decide an elections outcome.  In swing states the voters are very thoughtful about their canidates because they know that in the their case, that their vote really does count (par 20).  It is good to have voters who are very thoughtful and catious about their vote.  The Electoral Colleges encourages this type of behavior among citizens by giving voters a chance to sway an  election in swing states.  Swing states can impact an election.  They are an example of how the Electoral College, while still not completely democtratic, still gives the people a vote.

3739677,"The topic of driveless cars is very controversial. Some people say that driveless cars will be hazard to society, and will only endanger more people all over the world so they should not be manufactured. Conversly, others believe they are a necessity and will be a great advance in technology for the future. I gravitate towards the former opnion of driveless cars becoming chaotic and troublesome, and they should not be developed. Driveless cars should not be invented because humans will be too distracted to handle them, the health and safety of pedestrians would be threatened, and the cars are not completely driveless.

In today's current society, people are engrossed in social media and digital communication. We are addicted to looking at Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and texting our friends and family that it has infected our daily lives. It has even contiminated our driving. People find their phones irresitable, and they can not even manage to restrain themselves from swiping up their phones to look at the newest message while driving. This leads to casaulties and injuries that are the result of the driver not having the ability to stay focused. If driveless cars are developed, people will have less of a reason to pay attention to the road. Once the car actually needs human help, the driver will be too invested in their phones that they won't respond, possibly leaving themselves or others brutally maimed or killed. My opponents say that the flashing lights that will be installed in these vehicles will be enough to keep drivers monitoring the road. However, I feel that this attempt of a precautionary measures will not be enough. With the drivers eyes fixated on the fluorescent screen and their bodies immobilized as they are fully immeresed into their phones, they will be blind to the flashing lights. Due to our cellular distractions, we will be unable to put our full attention into watching the road, and proving driveless cars should not be invented.

Everyday you hear about a car accident. Someone was looking at their phone, they ran a stoplight, or whatever the case may be. Now imagine driveless cars. the rate of car accidents will not be reduced but will actually increase because of these new vehicles. The driver may not pay attention, and when the car needs the human to take control, they won't react in time and will collide with another vehcile. There could also be technical difficulties with the car where it doesn't alert the driver when it needs to causing another incident of vehicular chaos. The article even states that they are laws banning the mere testing of computer-driven cars. There are endless possibilites as to what could happen, but this is enough to show that driveless cars will only threaten the lives of pedestrians even more than current cars.

The main interest in driveless cars is that they are supposed to be driveless. However this is false. The car still needs a human to pay attention to the road when the car needs assistance. The name is a fallacy and the current details about it prove it is useless. Why replace our current cars that work just fine with computerized cars that could have all kinds of issues. They are just a dangerous and expensive waste.

Driveless cars are a very interesting topic. However the shouldn't be made because humans will be too distracted to handle them, the health and safety of pedestrians would be threatened, and the cars are not completely driveless. Eventually they could be made when people are more responsible, and the technology is more reliable and safe, but as of now they should stay off the roads and in our imaginations.",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

3834cd0,"Humans always want to come up with new ways to make life simpler, wether it be a microwave that runs faster, or even more comfortable running shoes. Those all seem like pretty mundane things compared to what manufactures are developing now. Try to think of a world where cars use half of they use for fuel today, or where nobody has to buy a car because they aren't needed. Thats what manufaturers are trying to do, they are trying to develop cars that do not need drivers, cars that can drive themselves. Since the 1950's people have been trying to develop cars that do not require a driver. Personally I do not agree with the idea of a driverless car.

The idea is a good one but it's been in development since the 1950's and they still haven't made a fully functional driverless car. There are people who say the reason why is because we don't have the exact technology to actually create a car the is driverless, yes that is true, but when will they have the technology. Five years from now, twenty years from now, we don't know and whose to say we will ever get that technology. Google anounced that it had cars that could drive on their own, but only on special circumstances. The cars they have developed the driver still has to stay alert for when the car gets into roadwork, or has to drive around an accident. That could pose a danger because what if the driver falls asleep or isn't paying attention to the road. That could pose a threat to both the driver and others well being.

Also some manufacturers have been developing a smart road system with dual polarity magnets, the cars would read the polarities and would stay on the road. The issue with that is to create a smart road system would take to much time and effort to put together, which make it very impractical. Instead manufaturers turned to smarter cars instead. They desinged it to have sensors that would mimic the actions of a human, like monitering the road, video cameras mounted near the rearveiw mirror, and a inertial motion sensor. It all sounds very grand, elaborite, and very expensive.

In 2013 BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assist"". The car would be able to handle driving functions at a speed of twenty five miles per hour. However, special touch sensors make sure the driver always have their hands on the wheel. I see multiple issuse with the idea of a ""Traffic Jam Assist"", first off the car can only take control of functions at speeds of twenty five miles per hour. Also the driver has to take control if they are to go over twenty five miles per hour. In fact none of the cars that have been developed actually are truly driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake, but the driver still has to take control sometimes. What would happen if the driver got distracted or fell asleep at the wheel? Disaster would follow.

There are many perks about driver less cars, less fuel being one of them but there are also many issues I see with the cars developed. Having to have a driver in them ready to take over if nessesary, some states not allowing driverless car test, not having the exact technology needed to make these cars a safe as possible, and not to mention human error that can always occur in driving. I believe that maybe in the future when technology has advance more then maybe diverless cras wouldn't be obsolete. But right now in the era of 2016 driverless cars are not needed. Mainly because we still have driving issuse that need to be solved like people getting distracted by phones, reackless drivers, and cars that aren't built good to begin with. So in the future they might have a purpose but until they can develop a car that is completly safe and has the technology needed to create it, we simply do not need driverless cras.

385790a,"Driverless cars are a relatively new concept in the automobile industry, and the benefits they offer could potentially decrease the risk in driving, especially given the inconsistencecy of drivers in today's world. While this is a tempting and seemingly perfect solution to reducing the number of car accidents, I do not support the idea of driverless cars.

The author states in section four that, ""The combination of all of this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel"". While humans are not in any way perfect drivers, the natural instincts and reactions of a human behind the wheel are impossible to capture in the form of sensors, robots, or mechanincs of any kind. In situations where unorthodox solutions are needed to remain in control of the car and keep from crashing, veteran drivers have the knowledge and experience to do so. Robots may have programs to react in certain situations, or to move out of the way if an object is coming towards the car at a rapid speed, but not all situations can be programmed. Robots simply cannot react the same ways humans do, which brings me to my next reason for not supporting driverless cars.

Section eight of the passage focuses on the psychological aspects of driverless cars, and introduces thd idea of laziness and boredom in human nature. Later on, the author states that some manufacturers hope to address this problem by including entertainment in the cars to remedy this boredom. Bringing in car entertainment wuld only further distract the now obsolete human drivers from the road, which in the case of an emergency, could prove fatal to not only the driver, but the passengers in the car as well. The Google car mentioned in section 7 ""Announces when the driver should be prepared to take over"". If the human did not hear the car announce this, and the car was reverted to the drivers control, the driver might end up in a crash. If the driverless cars provide more distractions than are at hand in the world today, no matter if a human is driving or not, the human driving the car could end up dead along with the passengers of the car. If driverless cars do become a reality, human drivers may one day become obsolete.

Today's world is focused heavily on transportation and getting from one point to the next. Driverless cars would fufil this requirement, but without the help of human drivers. The more that driverless cars would develop and improve, the less and less amount of humans would know how to drive. While this does not seem like a major problem if driverless cars were a reality, but the malfunctioning of systems would prove to be chaotic. If there was a systemwide problem with driverless cars, all of the vehicles in use, malfuctioning or not, would have to be recalled and fixed, causing mass hysteria. Because of the loss of driving skills, nobody would know how to drive. Humans would be unable to travel places, go to work, or do recreational activities.

Driverless cars may promote many benefits to humans seeking leisure and comfort while driving, but driverless cars could prove to create some very serious safety issues, especially on the busy roads of today's society.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

3946e1a,"Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point b. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possible. Cars are a suitable to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a public bus, but those other forms of transportation just might be the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an absolutly amazing thing but, maybe they just cause way to much stress, and maybe they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a bus or a train you do not have to worry about washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a bad traffic jam on I-4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, but there are many advanteges to limiting our car usage.

One advantage that not only humans would benefit from, but also plants and animals is that there would be a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extreamly harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhuast pipes in our cars. Your car alone dosent give off much gas but collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in big cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record breaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ban on cars. This is described in the second article "" Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, "" On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" After France limlited driving there congestion was down by 60 percent. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columbia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, it describes the annual car-free day they have to reduce smog. "" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". So all over the world people are relizing that wilthout cars, we are insuring the saftey and well being of our environment.

The second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. Haveing to repeatingly wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the back of your car screasming and yelling all while music is blasting, causes stress. So obviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not be as stressed as we usually are. There would be no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article "" In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a citezen named Huidrun Walter, states "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". So with out the stress of a car Huidrun Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, "" Car-free dai is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, it states "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.

In conclusion, there are many advanteges to limiting car use, one being theat we get to help the environment and two being that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to become the healthy enironment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to be unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get better and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it. Some might not think that this is an advantage, but i just explained that it is a clear advantege that has been proved to help the enviornment and reduce stress. Limiting car use is a very effective advantage that really does work in more than one place.            ",5,3.0,3.0,,":

The Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and got better pictures than the Viking did and it showed that there was no alien monument, it was just a natural landfrom.

Lastly the picture that the Viking took was not very good quality compared to the pictures took in 2001.

One reason that the Face on Mars was not made by aliens is because the Mars Global Surveyor got the best picture of it in 2001 and it just turned out to be a natural landform. In line 11 it says that ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he also added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

Another reason that the Face was not made by aliens is that the face is the equivalent of as butte or a mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. In paragraph 12 it compares the Face on Mars to the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The pictures that the

Mars Global Surveyor took in 2001 were a lot more clearer than the pictures took by the Viking in 1976. In paragraph 10 it says that Malin's team captured an amazing picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixal in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixal in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how bad the quality was in the 1976 photo taken by the Viking. Also, it proves that it was not a good photo and that the 2001 photo shows so much more and is way better quality. Other people might say that in the photo of '98, taken by the cmaera on board the MGS had to pear through wispy clouds to see the face, which made the alien markings hidden by the haze. Then the picture or 2001 proved that there was no alien markings and that the Face was just a landform.

In conclusion, this is why I believe that the Face of Mars was not made by aliens and is just a natural landform. First of all, The Mars Global Surveyor got better quality pictures than the Vikning did. Also, the 2001 picture shows that the Face is the equivalent to a mesa or butte, which are landforms that are common in the American West. Lastly, when you compare the '76, '98, and the '01 picture side by side you can tell that the '98 and the '01 pictures are more clear and show that the Face is just a landform.",5,3.0,,,":**

3cc2f1c,"Is Venus exploration safe?

""The Evening Star,"" although being the brightestplanet and ""twin""of earth , proves to be a very challenging place to exiamine. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is an article written by the author explaining the reasons of why exploration to Venus is very dangerous and why it wants to be explored by scientists. The article explains in much detail the dangers and possibilities that that could happen if th exploration could happen. It also gives brief information about how Venus is made up and the history of why is an intruiging planet. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author supports his idea by using data based information, question and answer responses, and the history of exploration in Venus.

In the article, the author uses a lot of data based information to support his claims about the challenges of exploration in Venus. One of the most mportant pieces of information being about what type of planet Venus is and why it is dangerous. The author says ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience o our own planet""(Paragraph 3). This briefly gives detail of how dangerous it is for humans to visit Venus knowing that the atmospheric pressure could easily crush a submarine that can withstand high pressures and liquefy many metals. This also supports his/her claims of why it is likely that the idea of exploring venus is impossible for these very reasons. Not only does this help support his claim; the information informs the reader about Venus and lets them know more about why it is a plant that NASA is very intrigued in.

In the article, the author uses a good amount of question and answer responses that help to inform the reader and support his claims of why exploration to Venus is dangerous. A good exapmle of a question that most readers will thnk of would be ""Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?""(Paragraph 4). This question not only supports his claim but also gains the readers trust knowing that the author is very informed about what he/she is talking about and knows what the readers want to know about. Knowing that the author can recall much information about the dangers and expectations of further exploration to venus benefits his argument by gaining their trust and support on his claim.

Using the history of exploration in Venus helps support the authors claims in many ways. Knowing the history falls back into the subect that the author know whae/she is talking about and also allows the reader to know more about the subject. ""Vensu was probably covered largely with oceans and could have suppported various forms of life, just like those on earth,""(Paragraph 4). This piece of information breifly explains the reasons of why scientists value the research done with Venus knowing that it is very comparable to earth. This information also explains the now leading dangers of Venus because of its physical changes and leads to the possiblilities given by NASA of ways that Venus can be explored.

The author supports his idea of Venus's exploration being impossible by using data based information, question and answer responses, and the history of exploration in Venus. Giving the data of how Venus's state is and the leading dangers that the planet could give if explored supports the authors claims and allows the reader to now then make the decision or to be informed if Venus should be explored or not.

3d13ded,"In today's society technology is becoming much more advanced. Pretty soon, people won't ever need to touch a steering wheel again. However, does this seem like a good idea? We people are prone to distraction and companies aren't even sure who would be at fault if an accident were to occur. Would one want to pay his own medical bills when someone else should've paid for it instead?

We people, being human, have the tendency to become very distracted, some more than others. The driverless car is 90% autonomous, meaning that 90% of the time it can drive on it's own. The other 10% is manual, meaning that people need to be in control of the car. During that 90%, people would become so distracted. The article states, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over--something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" Just because there is entertainment does not mean that people would use it. Some would prefer to stay on their phone or take a good long nap. Warning signs in the car that tell people when to drive might also be ignored as well. If someone falls asleep and is a deep sleeper, he might not wake up to a vibrating chair or flashing lights. Someone too involved in his phone might also not realize that he is needed to take control of the car if his mind is too focused on his device. Sometimes people become too involved in their own little world, and this would not be good when they are needed to drive.

The question being considered right now is, ""who would be at fault if the technology failed and someone was injured?"". It could go both ways. If the driver wasn't paying attention, then he would be responible for his own injuries. If that person had been alert and paying attention and the car malfunctioned, then the manufacturer would be at fault. There is no way to know though if the driver is actually paying attention. Since there's no way to see, if a driver had been alert they could easily be accused of not paying attention because there is no way for anyone to know but the driver. He would be paying his medical bills instead of the manufacturer. It is not fair towards people if they are accused for an incicident, but it is not their fault. If too many accidents occurred, companies would start to get sued and so would people as well. It wouldn't be too great for someone to get sued for an accident if it is not even his fault.

Although there are flaws, there are also advancements being made to fix those flaws. Manufacturers are trying to install cameras in the cars to make sure people are paying attentinon and not just dozing off. Also, it's not like the car has to be on autopilot the whole time. People can choose when they want to drive most of the time. If they don't want to drive but are needed to then they have no choice. These are all true, but that doesn't change the fact that people could still be blamed for accidents that are caused by car malfunctions and not themselves. It also doesn't change out natural instincts to text while we are needed to drive or to answer a call or jam out to the radio. Even when the car needs us to drive, we are still going to reach for our phones when it buzzes or turn up the radio, both of these being huge distractions for us.

The technological advances being made do not change our natural human instincts of distraction, or the fact that we could be blamed for something that was not even our fault. The driverless car may seem like a cool new way of living, but that does not mean it's danger free or 100% guaranteed to work all the time. It still has its own flaws just as we do, and sometimes technology can't fix that. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

It could help students perform better in school by making there work more fun or more entertaining for them. When students have to type a research paper they are always worried about how long the paper has to be or how hard of a project it will be. This can put pressure or stress on students. Students wouldn't have to worry about this if the computers could recognize their emotions. In paragraph six it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If a computer could recognize that you are confused or bored and for it to act like a human instructor, then this would make class work a lot easier for students. If a student was confused about something and needed help but the teacher was already helping a student, the computer could recognize that you are confused and it could act like a human instructor, like it states in paragraph six, then the student wouldn't have to wait fo the teacher and he or she could get the help they need.

This kind of technology could make work for students less boring. If a student has a research paper to type and is struggling to find information and then they start to get frustrated and bored because they can't find what they need. If a computer could reconize this, then it could possibly help the student find information. The computer could reconize that they are bored or struggling to find information and if the computer could somehow know what they are trying to research based on recent searches then it could pull up something similer to an add but with links to websits with information on what they are researching.

The idea of having technology like this would be really useful to students. It could make class work easier and less boring for students. If a computer could read your facial expressions and could tell what your emotion is based off your expressions and then take that information to make lessons easier. I think it would be helpful to a lot of students. I think a lot of students would find this creepy at first but once they learn more about this I think it would be valued by many students.

3ec8931,"Aliens vs. Knowledge

Twenty-five years before 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a landform in the shape of a face on Mars's surface. This, after being released to the media, caused an uprising of speculations. Did aliens make this? Were there other beings on other planets? Are we not alone?

A famous scientist once said that we researched for other life on other planets because humans didn't want to be alone in this vast galaxy. He also said that it could cause either fear or excitement. The media wanted to grab the attention of the common people, and to do that they needed something extraordinary. The media spins the truth to benefit their needs. You can't believe everything they say because all they can do is gain by your speculation.

NASA hardly thought this was the work of aliens. They didn't want the people to think they were lying, they wanted to seek the truth. Even if they were hiding something, they could only ever lose everything for covering it up. More attention on the dying out NASA program would gain the support and money to fund them. So, on April 5, 1998, they sent another spacecraft to take pictures of the landform.

Not everyone thought the image that came up, the one of a landform, sufficed. They argued that it was probably too hazy and that the image wasn't a reliable resource. They said that the haze was blocking the alien markings.

Again, NASA sent another spacecraft in 2001 to take better pictures in different angles. The picture showed a landform much like a butte or mesa here on Earth. Some people stated that it was a conspiracy.

Mars has unique quirks like every planet. Here on earth we have natural landforms such as a mesa, and mountains, and rivers. Mars isn't much different.

Scientists have special catogories for classifying a planet, and Pluto did not meet those requirements. So, every planet has to have at least one thing in common with another. Just beacause Mars is a different planet, doesn't mean that it can't have landforms much like those on Earth.

To say that one planet has aliens because of a landform, is to say that we are aliens as well. Don't we have mountains? Yes, you might say, but it's because of tectonic plates pushing against each other. Science has taught us many things, so now we know something foreign to people back then.

Take Christopher Columbus as in example. Before he sailed the ocean, everyone thought that the earth was flat. After he disproved the theory, people saw the earth for what it was: a round, water planet. Another great example would be Galileo, who disproved the theory that Earth was the center of the galaxy and the sun and everything else rotated around it. People had to have curiosity, and the willpower to go on with these expeditions. After they disproved a theory, it made more sense, and the world around us just is. Now, we don't question on how the mountains were made. We don't question on why we have day and night.

We are more educated now, but there are still things we haven't learned. That's why people should have a more open mind about finding the truth. Once we find the truth, we'll move on to bigger things and so on and so on. This mystery is one which piques people's interest, but turning to myth and false facts isn't the way to go. Exploring and learning from new innovations is what makes scientists who they are. They took the time to go through the process of being a certified scientist. To say you are smarter than one is disrespectful towards them, saying all their hard work was worth nothing.

So, to summarize, aliens did not make the landform on Mars. It was a natural occurence that got blown up into bigger proportions because the media wanted to satisfy their own needs to get profit. NASA knows what they are saying, and we should respect their statements until we ,for sure, know ourselves that the statement is false.          ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

3f19352,"Is the use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System valuable to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom?. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto, the author describes how a new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promissing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a sudent is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it hepls the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them.

School brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the techers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or thewy might be confused but afraid to speak up so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". It also states ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor"". By this evidence , the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored; this would allow them to think throught about changing a new method to teach so the studetns don't get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The mayority of students nowdays don't care about school or just don't get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don't bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success but they don't implement it, so what is best than a new tehnology to help out a little.

There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time.. Wouldn't it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". It also states ""The software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)"". This evidence illustrates by the aouthor shows how great and advanced this technology is, being able to identify not only one emotion, but more than one at the same time, letting the world know, but most important the teachers in a classroom that they don't have to worry more about to be able to identify by guessing how a student is doing, because this technology has the answers. It is so hard to identify when a person is feeling all types of feelings and not be able to help out becuase no one knows what the mixed feelings are . Teachers have a rough time with students trying to figure it out. But with ths technology teahcers would be more notified of the problem, so they create a scenari to help them out.

Emotions are everywhere, everyone experience at least one of them. This new technology not only helps the person to express an emotion but to produce them. A teacher in a classroom is able to teach but sometimes they are not able to transmit the feeling of learing to the students, and the new technology Facial Action Coding System would be a lot of help. In the passage it states ""The Mona Lisa is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". It also states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, incluiding emotional communication"". By this evidence the author projects how this new technology is capable of doing just anything and how it helos to improve the best on a classroom, helping out not only the students but the teachers. With this new technology teachers would be able to get the students to be more interested in the class, leading them to get a good grade, and to the understanding of every new topic.

Now, Do you think this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?. By being able to detect 6 basic emotions and even mixed emotions, to recognize whether a student is bored or confused and by helping the person not only to express the emotion but to produce it, it is shown that this new technology is valuable. Communication is one of the basic steps to create a better living world but sometimes communication is just not implemented in society. So the help of this new technology is needed. A teacher woulld be able to help a student is they knew if the students where confused or bored. They would try different types of ways to get back the attention of the students so they can do good in the calls. Another reason is being able not only to know one emotion but multiple emotions; Teachers wouldn't have to be guessing the emotions of the studetns, and the time lose trying to guess their emotions, they would be finding ways to help the student solve their problem, becuase they already know what is going on. In the classroooms it is very hard for the sdtudents to concentrate in a very boring topic, and the teachers just will continue beuase the sdtudents just don't communicate or show anything else than just a black emotion and this new technology is able to get the person to express the emotion. Is really interesting what this technology can do.         ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

3f4a9c6,"Everyday the world and the technology around us is changing, evolving. It is something that has been happening since the biginning of time. It began with growing our own crops, then changed further with the development of communities and cities, and technology kept advancing with time. As technology has evolved, people have had to do less and less for themselves. Not everyone has to grow their own food or make their own clothes anymore. The world is at a time now where cars are not just a luxcery. To most people, they are a neccesity. The next advancement in that process, is the making of driverless cars. This would make our lives easier and our roads safer.

Driverless cars would not only be better for convienence, but also for costs and flexibility. In the text it states, ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis..."" That would cut out fuel costs for most people, which takes up a lot of some families' income. Second, ""...offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This way, these cars may be able to pick someone up who lives in the country. They would not have to take a specific route everywhere. These cars would make our lives cheaper and easier.

The car would be able to funtion just as if a human driver was in the front seat driving the car. It would be able to analyze its surroundings. The text states, ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an intertial motion sensor."" This example from the text illustrates that cars would be able to know where they are going, know when other cars around, and see their surroundings just as a human driver would. Another example from the text, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves..."" The cars would be able to do these funtions and so much more from the minute the are done being built. Some of these skills take new drivers years to master.

Driverless cars could possibly reduce accidents and save lives. For example, ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" Human drivers may freeze under the pressure when a frightening situation happens, but these cars would be able to stop on their own to help prevent an acident. Another example, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" This way if the car does need assistance from a human driver, the driver can be entertained until they need to be notified that they need to take over. This would be better since the entertainment automatically turns off, unlike when a person is texting and driving. This new equipment would stop so many people from being injured from car accidents.

Some people think that driverless cars may not be such a good idea. According to the text, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" The cars' manufacturers have thought about this and have thought about installing am entertainment system that automatically shuts off when the driver is needed. The text also states, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" While people may be used to human drivers, history has proven that technology can often make things easier and safer. While this technology develops this new car may be not only as safe as car with a human driver, but may eventually be safer. While there are still kinks to work out, driverless cars will someday be the new normal in the transportation world.

Driverless cars are being built and are getting ready to be made a reality to the world. Just like all new technologies, it will have its problems in the beginning, but all problems have solutions and room for improvement. People were worried the first time an airoplane flew on autopilot, but now they are used to it and pilots know it as what is normal. These cars will be another advancement made in human history.

3ff53d1,"In order to inform the fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage, let's first talk about how it impacts society, what will happen if society doesn't reduce the excessive amount of car usage, and what they can do to improve societies living conditions. Driving has majorly changed since back then, driving is an everyday thing for society; most kids get dropped off to school by car, adults drive to work, and families go on trips by car. Driving has succesfully impacted society in a positive way in this generation, but it does have some negative and unseen sides to it.

Limiting access to a car can positively change the outcome of a suburb, whether it be the United States, or Canada. According Source 1, ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" That gives the reader an idea of how the suburb is like without the use of cars, everything is closer to your house. You can walk to the nearest bakery or grocery store, creating the central idea of the stereotypical 'perfect town' seen in shows. In order to build that idea, cities around the world are being influenced by that concept. According to Source 3, ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" That proves the fact that if cars are used at the minimum, the city will change for the better. According to Source 2, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" In conclusion, with less usage of cars, the better conditions the city would have.

If society doesn't start reducing the amount of car usage in their city, it will end up being a horrible decision. According to Source 2, ""after days of near-recorded pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global the city."" That being said, cars cause the city to endure smog, causing leaders to input a partial ban. In order to fathom the idea of how many drivers refused to follow that law; Source 2 states, ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined."" That can easily manifest the idea of how society won't be able to live without their cars, which can end up being disasterous. Smog seems to be a major result of car usage in cities, but in the future, it will lead into a worse situation. In Bogota, Colombia, an event was created to ban the use of cars. According to Source 3, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" To conclude, if cities tried to reduce car usage, it'll drastically decrease the risk of smog and greenhouse effect.

Improving the living conditions of society will produce a tremendous amount of positive effects towards the city. According to Source 4, ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in american behavior."" That being said, America is planning to attempt reducing car usages in the country. Also according to Source 4, ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" That also manifests the idea that America itself, is slowly reducing it's numbers of car usage. Whether it be the expensive prices of cars or the hard driving tests, the less people who drive, the better the environment. According to Source 1, ""the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" That forms the idea that without cars driving around, children have an excuse to go walk around outside. Rather than being inside not doing anything, and taking a car ride to where they need to go; Vauban's rule helps provide children with a different and active childhood.

Driving is slowly causing the countries to change, children don't go out that much. Technology already limits childrens excercise and their time outside, but driving causes children to barely be outside. Also, excessive driving can cause horrible conditions towards the environment itself. Limiting car usage and how it impacts society, what will happen if society doesn't reduce the excessive amount of car usage, and what they can do to improve societies living conditions are all explained, creating the idea that the less drivers there are, the better outcome it'll be.                        ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

40403c9,"Dear Senator,

The debate regarding the necessity of the Electoral College and it's validity has aroused some tension among the citizens of America, and the government as well. This process is not only used to decide the President of our nation, but to ensure the equality of the voting. By establishing our county as a democracy, we made a promise to maintain a systematic balance between the government and it's people. Without the existence of the Electoral College, where would this balace be? The Electoral College is the basis upon which our country is built, and is vital to uphold the balance and equality between government and people.

The Electoral College has many benefits towards the nation that many people are unaware of. For example, in order to do well, a candidate must have connections nation-wide. In source 3, line 19, it states ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" This means that no candidate is guaranteed a win if they only appeal to one area or region. This creates an overall balance throughout the nation, and makes sure only a portion of the country doesn't have all the power. Also, this allows the people to have a clear understanding of who they're voting for, and what this means.

Equality is key, and without this equality, where would our nation be? By continuing the use of the Electoral College, we have decided to be the best we can be. It says in Source 1, line 1 ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" This provides valid information to support the necessary balance of people and government.

The Electoral College also produces a winner inarguably qualified due to the amount of votes received. This is clearly described in Source 3, line 22, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" Due to the use of this process, the election of a President can be efficient and simple. The President can now be

Some may argue that this process does not clearly represent the people or their votes. This is because some may vote for a ""slate of electors"" as opposed to the president. However, this belief can be decidedly rejected due to the lack of valid evidence to support the claim. How are voters expected to vote fairly if they are not given the support to do so?

Overall, it can be declared that the Electoral College plays a vital role in maintaining the internal balance of our nation that the citizens inhabiting it are so reliant on. Choosing to reject this process would be deciding to injure our nation, its future, and its people.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

41b9987,"Facial Action Coding System is a new software that has given computers the ability to identify the emotion of a person. It does this by constructing a 3-D model of the face. This new innovative software can identify six emotions of a human. These emotions are happiness, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear. This tecnology can be useful in many different ways in today's world. There are also some things that may not be so good about this either.

This software has many positve things about it that can help students and teachers across the world. The software can help inside the classrooms. Using this software to calculate and identify people's emotions, it would be very easy to see if a student is struggling. Many students who struggle keep it to themselves hoping to catch on. This may not be the case in every student, though. Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If this software can actually detect this, then it would make learning and teaching way easier. Teachers could try different teaching methods to help with the growth and progress of their students and help them understand what they're doing. They could aslo try something that is more fun and appesaling to the students. This technology could be lifesaving in the classroom.

Although this software could help many people everywhere, how does everyone feel about this? If used in the classrooms, some parents and students may not want this to be a part of their learning environment. Many students could be sad all of the time due to person issues and home life. Would they want their teacher to know that they were always upset? I think that it would be a good idea to first have recieved permission from every student and parent before allowing this into the classrooms.

I also think that this software could literally save lives. If it is able to identify these emotions, it could prevent students from harming themselves. The software can determine your emotion based on every little detail of your face. In pararaph 8 the author states, ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius.""

423a7ea,"The thought of a computer program being able to read emotions sounds very interesting at first. It almost makes a person feel like he or she are in a science fiction book set in the future. Though it may be interesting, that does not necessarily make it right. The truth of the matter is that though a computer program measuring how someone feels may be interesting, it is an invasion of privacy and teachers have no need to know a student's emotions while in class. The new technology, Facial Action Coding System, is not valuable to be used in a classroom because it is an invasion of a student's privacy and is not necessary.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to be used in a classroom because of how invasive it is to a student's privacy. The text explained that the technology was able to determine that in the Mona Lisa painting the person being painted was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent happy. No one should be able to know to that great of a detail what another person is feeling without that person's premission. If a teacher wanted to know the emotions of his or her students, simply asking them how they feel is enough. Using that technology in a classroom crosses a boundry of privacy that many students would not be comfortable with. Many students would not feel at ease and safe being in the classroom knowing their emotions are being read.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to be used in a classroom because it is not necessary. In the text Dr. Huang, who works with the Facial Action Coding System technology, says that most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Students and people in general are already communicating their emotions to the level that their emotions need to be communicated. When someone sees another person smiling, he or she knows that person is happy, or if someone sees a person frowning, he or she knows that person is sad. The text says the technology could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored to support that the technology could be beneficial in a classroom setting. But the truth of the matter is, if a teacher wants to know when his or her class is becoming confused or bored, all he or she would have to do is ask. That is why most teachers ask after a lesson, ""Does anyone have any questions?""

Not only that, but a teacher would not have to know if a student is happy or sad in the first place. The responsibility of a teacher is to teach and to ensure the students understand. A teacher does not need to know if his or her students are happy or sad. A school would be wasting its money to pay for a system that is not of necessity.

It is evident with all of the facts stacked against it, that Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in a classroom setting because of its invasiveness to student privacy and the lack of a need for it in a classroom. From the fact that knowing exactly everything students are feeling would make students uncomfortable, to the fact that a teacher could ask a student if he or she wanted to know how that student is feeling, it is clear this technology lacks value in a classroom setting. School administration and the community should ensure that this kind of technology never gets put in any classrooms. This would be a waste of money for the school corporation because of the lack of necessity for it. It would also make many students uncomfortable, which could in turn make it harder to learn.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

4246dc0,"Driverless cars are too expensive, trivial, and dangerous to be developed for public use. The development of these cars would require extensive funding, and this money could be much better spent. Some of these cars would only be partially automated and would still require a capable driver at all times, so what would be the point? Finally, driverless cars would be concerning from a safety standpoint - would these cars really be able to safely maneuver out of dangerous situations?

First, the development of driverless cars would be expensive. Automated cars require many sensors and cameras that regular cars do not need, and even with these sensors, the cars are not capaple of completely driving themselves. In order to achieve a reliable driverless system, all of our roads would have to have electricity or magnets installed, which even the article admits would be ""too expensive to be practical"". Furthermore, the money spent on developing these cars could be spent to help those who are less fortunate rather than creating new things for ourselves.

Another issue with driverless cars is the idea of cars that only assist the driver. These cars would drive most of the time, but they would, ""notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". These cars would certainly be helpful, but what would be the point of having a self-driving car if you still have to watch the road as if you were driving yourself? Some manufacturers talk of adding, ""in-car entertainment and information systems,"" but if the driver were focused on these systems, would they be able to react quickly enough if the car approached a dangerous situation?

This question leads to what is probably the biggest issue with these cars: many developers of driverless cars claim that these vehicles would improve public transportation and, ""use half the fuel of today's taxis,"" but what about the safety of the passengers? A truly driverless car would leave its passengers helpless in the face of an impending accident, and the addition of entertainment systems for part-time drivers would likely not give the drivers enough of a warning to react in the case of an emergency situation.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be developed on a large scale. The huge amount of money that would have to be spent to make these cars safe would be much better spent helping those in need. Furthermore, cars that only partially drive themselves seem to defeat the intended purpose of the driverless car, as well as raising some safety concerns. It would be extremely difficult for the car alone to avoid dangerous situations, and the addition of entertainment systems would limit how much time a driver would have to assess and respond to danger. In all, driverless cars are far too expensive, needless, and dangerous to be developed or produced on a large scale.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

425d8c4,"With the rise of technology and accesability, students in schools are bound to wonder away from the current lession and tred towards their phones in the face of bordom or general stress. How can we fix this you may ask, with emotion detecting technology. This technology can help schools in that it focuses on specific muscle groups, can detect false emotions, and can help students get beck to the task at hand, school.

First off, how does this technology even recognise emotion? Emotions are always displayed by body poster, facail exspressions, and speech. This technology primarilly focuses on facil exspressions. By focusing on 44 major muscles and a 3D model created within the software through a camera, can effectively distinguish 6 basic emotions. These emotions are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the must move like human muscles....six basic human emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" This technology works so well in fact that it was able to calculate the emotions on a painting. The one and only, Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. In this instance of the painting, the software concluded that she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This being said, you can see all of these features in the painting with her smile; however, her smile is also seems to be hiding other small emotions that can be portraied as insecure but wholesome. If this technology can effectivly 'see' the portrable emotions off a painting, then it can most definatly can be used within the school systems.

What about the common conseption that students go to school with a smile but arn't really happy? It can do this too. It comes to that facail movements can be seen as true or false by the muscles that are being used in that moment in time. Such as the muscle group, zygomatic major, used in a genuine smile; however, in a false smile you also use the risorius. ""But in false smiles...using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" The usefulness of this technology doesn't stop at just being able to identify false smiles but teachers can use this information to more effectively connect with the students. When a student is a distracted by stressers, they can't focus, and when they can't focus, it makes the teachers look like they arn't doing their jobs properly by the test score of the students because of it. This stratigy however, is nothing new. In the eyes of an exspert, facail exspression tell your true intentions. ""To an experts, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celbrity isn't being truthful."" Thus, this late technology doesn't seem to far fetched to use in our schools.

As I breafly mentioned in the last pharagragh, students need to be able to focus in order to be seccesesful in school. With modern stressers that teachers sometimes don't see as big deal, students on the other hand may lead to distraction. With these stressers far and wide, how do we identify them? By using the facail recognition software. Say for instance a student as his or her mind elsewhere besides the classroom and is missing out on a major transition lession that is the key to the next few lession. They won't get it and will further lead into new problems. But say that the software picks up on the student and detects that he or she is feeling angered, depressed, or just has a lack of intrest. This software can then send the data to the teachers computer thus letting them know that they may need a recap or support in general. Thus further action can be taked by the teacher to strengthen the bond of students and teachers. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Another way that it can be used in the classroom as if the students is angered and frustration is building inside because their minds are in two places at once to only confuse them even more. The software can be designed to shut off the computer, alowing the student to take a breath and contemplate on what is wrong themselves before an intructer aid them in the personal mater before continueing on into the lesson as a whole. ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above yours eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" In short, the possibilities are atronomical when thinking of incorperating them into a schools systems.

In short, the addition to facail recognitions systems into the schools is a great idea. Thus it can recogize emotions effectively, detect false emotions, and help students regain focus within the classrooms.

42616c7,"Driverless cars are what some envision as the future. They picture a world where every car is automated, and where every kind of transport is regulated. Many very large companies have poured a fortune into creating technology that will enable the eradication of a need for drivers. However, there are a huge number of negative effects of this movement. I am completely against the idea of driverless cars, for reasons such as recreation, cost, and safety.

First of all, many people in support of driverless cars portray driving as it is now as a dull part of our society that simply wastes time and energy. However, many, many people enjoy driving, simply for the feel and the experience. If driverless cars were to be implemented, there is no doubt that after a while driving oneself would be considered dangerous, irresponsible, and would likely be outlawed. Not only is there no way to implement such as system, as there would be far too much backlash from the community that enjoys driving, it would be wrong to completely forget about and not consider their opinions as valuable as others.

Second, the cost of a system of driverless cars would be enormous, and quite frankly, insurmountable. People do not realize that these cars would not function well in a society with a vast majority of people driving themselves. For a working system, the majority, if not all of the cars on the road, would have to be replaced with driverless cars. There is no way that the government would provide the cost, and there is no way that everyone has the interest in or the money to buy a driverless car. Not only is it impossible to replace every car with a driverless one, insurance and settlements would be nigh impossible to figure out, as even the article says, there is no definitive blame to be made. The operator of the car could blame the manufacturers for a poorly made vehicle while the manufacturers could simply argue the fact that the driver could have taken control of the car at any time.

Finally, safety would be a major concern. One of the article's biggest faults is that it says that driverless cars will be able to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Driverless cars are not able to mimic humans, and will never be able to mimic humans, unless artificial intelligence technology becomes equal to humans. People have the ability to consider moral possibilities and choices. For example, if in a case where the options are a collision which saves the driver's life but has a very large chance of killing another driver, or the choice to swerve off the road but result in severe if not fatal injuries to the driver, the machine would not be able to make that decision. Humans have the unique and intrinsic ability to think, quickly and effectively, through a situation. Machines, however, would be forced to make a decision based on a certain goal, whether that may be the prevention of collateral damage, the safety of the driver, or arrival at the destination.

For these reasons, driverless cars absolutely cannot be a possibility or a good decision. I believe companies should be working to help make drivers more safe by adding other safety features, rather than trying to erradicate drivers from the situation altogether.

42e55d6,"The Electoral College is a cruel, pointless process that simply makes a percentage of votes, or all of them if you look at it that way, to mean nothing, and allows for circumstances like the 2000 election. There are plenty of reasons, and plenty of contradictions in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised mehod of choosing the President.""

To begin, the winner-take-all system is very unfair to the voters. Voters in certain, dominated areas are supposed to know what they are voting for, yet get nothing to teach them? Not that it matters regardless, since every person within a state supports a political party, right, and, depending on your state's veiw, all Republicans/Democrats have no idea what they are voting for, correct? Like Bradford Plumer says, you shouldn't have to move to Ohio to be able to get a vote. There is also the point countered Mr. Posner's article, which is that those in party-dominated states will have a feeling their vote doesn't count, and he sais that one vote will not swing an election. Then why do you beleive an upside of the elecoral college is that those in more neutral states will feel their vote counts? Or do those in party-dominated states not matter, since those in neutrals think way more about their votes, and are the only ones you should trust, according to him? In practice, they are the only deciding factor .

There are also the many unwanted results from electoral colleges, such as the 2000 election's outcome defying the people. ""What Is the Electoral College?"" states you are voting for electors when you vote, but what is the point if they can simply defy you? It would be like if after the president was chosen, the Senate could overule him with a 1/5 vote. There is also the point in Plumer's article about the time Hawaii sent two slates, which forced the desicion to Nixon, who had to validate only the opponet's votes in fear of otherwise receiving bad publicity. There is also the strange way of resolving a tie, which boils down to the same thing as the winner-take-all system, except if more people support  it doesn't matter. It would be like if everybody in the  room wasn't alowed to vote, other than one voted, but everybody in the room agreed anyway for some strange, miraculous reason. (Of course, the one guy in the  next room doesn't agree, and completely takes out your vote, regardless of the fact that there were 30 people in this one.)

Now, there is the gregarious amount of contradictory statements that can be found within Mr. Posner's article. One has already been mentioned in the winner-take-all system paragraph. He also conveintly provides a dispute that had nothing to do with a close vote in the Electoral College, and everything to do with what is wrong with this winner-take-all system, being the 2000 election. In the same paragraph, me mentions how an Electoral tie is highly unlikely- as if a tie between the millions of US citizens is. His reason #5 can be easily solved by simply giving the presidency to the candidate who receives a plurality of votes, rather than a majority. Reasons number 3 and 4 both contradict reason 2 as well, stating that everybody gets a vote, only swing states should get a vote, and only bigger states should get a vote (even when there is a 51/49 split, where 51%=100%, mind you).

42f073f,"Driving is often one of the most frightning things to many peole whether they are starting to get their permit, or if they've been driving for a long time. The idea of driverless cars came to the mind of Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google. He even envisions a future where the public can have access to a transportation system such as cars that can drive themselves, and a public-transport taxi system that uses half the fuel of modern cars. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author wrote about the positive and negative sides to these inventions. The article covers many things about them; however, it does not fully explain the true nature of such vehicles being available for public use. These cars should not be allowed to be bought and used by the public.

As stated in paragraph two of the article, it states that these driverless cars aren't fully driverless. These cars have no crash thus far, but how safe is it really compare to their rival brands? ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents,"" What the sentence means is that these cars don't have one hundred percent control of how they drive. They require the driver to be full alert when pulling in and out of their driveways. Little do they know, that accidents can still happen when they have claimed they are better than any other car brand that uses the same radars and sensors.

Google isn't the first company to think of a smart car which isn't a surprise to those who have looked into different car brands. Companies like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by the year 2020. In 2013, BMW announced their development of a car called the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The difference between the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" and the driverless car is that BMW added a design to where the car itself notifies the driver when human skill is required. Another design element to the car is that the driver's seat actually vibrates to alert the driver when the vehicle is in danger of backing into any object. This choice of car is more safer than the driverless car as the Google car relies on the driver to focus on the road. Every driver has looked away from the road before, so it wouldn't be a surprise if an accident were to occur. Though there is another safety mesasure added to the Google car, a camera to watch the driver to make sure they keep their eyes on the road ahead. This could lead to some issues for privacy as people have been sensitive in the pass about their identities being shown to corporations. Not only could this lead to court sessions, but also lead to a possible debt for the company.

As stated earlier, the author did list both negative and positive things about the Google car. Paragraph eight shows the psychological side for drivers with this car, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?

We have to interpet the driving fun in a new way,"" Dr. Werner Huber stated. Manufacturers hope to do that by having entertainment and information systems that have displays that turn off when the driver needs to pay attention, an option drivers who want to use their electronic devices do not have. It is stated that this option is a safety feature; however it could be more of a distraction. The use of electronics has increased, and today's modern society is easily distracted by this. When the car needs the driver to take the wheel, how will the driver react while they're busy looking at a screen? Safety is a big concern, and so everything should be looked at and thought through.

States nationwide have already made it illegal to drive test computer-driven cars. Some states have limited the use of it, and it is because the safety of the cars are still not certain. If the car is proven to be of safe use, new laws will have to be made and so will the coverage of liability in a case of an accident. If most states have seen it as unsafe, why continue to research ways to make smart cars? Automechanics have focused on their work, and assume that these problems will be solved in the near future. How can we be so sure?

Technology everyday is improving little by little, and so is the need to travel. We have the technology to make whatever the mind wants to create, but some ideas should stay ideas. It's not a terrible ideas, but it could bring more trouble for everyone business to home workers alike. Safety to the public should always be the number one concern, not how high tech the car itself is. Instead of causing more accidents due to the car mechanics, we should let the drivers learn properly how to drive.",5,3.0,,,":** The essay attempts to develop a point of view on the issue of driverless cars but lacks consistency in critical thinking.

4301d19,"The Face on Mars

The Face that was found on Mars, was not created by aliens, it is a natural landorm. It's a natural landofrm becuase, scientists studied it, it is popuar, and there are pictures. Some may not believe that this is a natural landform. But, there is some information to make you want to believe it.

Stuides by scientists have shown that this Face is not just like any other. It was not created by aliens, and it is not normal. In the text it says,''Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.'' This describes how unusual this Face looked. There is no way that this Face was created by aliens. It is far more detailed that what aliens could have done.

The Face that was found on Mars, was very popular. The uniqueness of the Face made it stand out more to others. In the passage it says,'' It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lanes for 25 years!'' This tells the reader how the Face on Mars was important to most people. The Face on Mars was to be known all over the world.

Scientists took pictures of the Face on Mars. The pictures let you know what they look like and it gives you an idea of what they are describing. In the text it says,''Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.''

There was trial and error problems with the pictures. In the text it says,''The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.''

In 2001 they took another picture, and this one was more clearer that the one taken in 1976. The text also says,'' Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's aboslute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 neters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Some apponents may say that the Face on Mars was made by aliens. Maybe they have a point. In the text it says,'' Some people think the Fcae is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-eveidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.'' But, the photos that were taken make it clear that there is no way the unusual Face was made by aliens. In the text it says,''As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

As the years go on, people may still wonder how the Face on Mars was made. Some may still think that the aliens did it. Others might never get to know the real answer.

Some say that the Face reminds them of something on Earth. Thus, this must mean that the Face on Mars is a natural landform.                             ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

4330839,"Emotions are apart of everyday life. The way humans react to emotions is not always easy to recognize though. As a result, misunderstandings come in and miscommunication happens and life gets that much more complicated. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" by Nick D'Alto, it talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This particular system is able to use computers to identify human emotions based on their facial expressions. The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could show when a student is not understanding based on their expressions, it could help the teacher to know when and/or if a student has the lesson down-packed, and the technology is set up based on expert's opinions and reasrch.

The Facial Action Coding System is something worth investing in because the world is becoming more and more advanced and with this system, computers could possibly know whether a student doesn't understand what is being taught. In the article, the author explains how the system works. The text says, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions... Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This example shows how with the software, it will be able to pick up on when a student is expressing signs of distress because they don't understand. The author also uses the example of Web ads. He says, ""...If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" This proves how the technology will be used to observe and then change to the person's preference. This would be a big help in the classroom because students have different styles of learning and the computer can help to identify which one a student prefers.

If the system continues to grow, it could somehow enable the teacher to know when a student is ready to move on to another lesson because they already know what is being taught. In parapgraph six, the text explains how the programming can be modified. An expert says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This particular example from the text shows how the technology is so advanced that it help the teacher by doing his/her job. The software could somehow notify the teacher when a student is ready to move on or when one needs to work on the lesson a little longer.

The technonlogy is set up based on expert's research and opinions, so as there are more studies done, the system would be able to tell more accurately what a student is feeling and the lesson could be adjusted based on that. In paragraph five, the author supports his claim by saying that Dr. Huang's ""new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" Dr. Huang's research shows that the software will be continously changing and with those changes, comes advances that will be better equipped to help a child in their classroom. The author uses Dr. Huang's opinions to further his claim. Dr. Huang states, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements."" The explaining of the software proves that it will help children in classrooms because it was built upon years of studying and experiments. And those tests were used to build a software that could possibly change the world.

Facial expressions can sometimes make one amused or angry or they could even make a person fall in love. The problem is, it is hard for a person to read another person's face- unless they're an expert. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author argues how a technology called the Facial Action Coding System will help computers correctly idenity human emotions based on their facial expressions. The use of that software would be very valuable in a classroom because it could be aware of when a student does not comprehend what is going on, it could help the teacher to know when students are really getting the concept of what's being taught and because the technology is being constantly modified based on research and opinion, it would be reliable. With this technology in classrooms, confusion about what the student feels about the class and the work will be a thing of the past.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

4334c97,"Have you ever wanted to go to the other side of the world? As a Seagoing cowboy you can do that and much more. You can see sights and learn about them. You learn about hard work and how to do different things. You can have fun while doing a job. Last, you get to help others who have less then you. If you like this stuff then this is the job for you.

One cool thing about being a Seagoing cowboy is that you get to see a lot of cool sights. You can travel to different parts of the world. In the article it talks about how Luke went to China, Greece, and other parts of Europe. Another thing about the sights is that you can learn new stuff about the places you see. Also you can meet new people and maybe even talk with them. Last, you can have your friends come with you and you can see the sights with them and enjoy both. The sights are great but what you learn is also great.

There are lots of things to learn on a cattle boat. One thing about being a Seagoing cowboy is that you learn about hard work. Like in the article it talks about Luke's aunt Katie and her farm that he worked on and how that prepared him for the hard work on the cattle boat. One thing that will help you learn hard work is caring for the animals on the boat. So when you come home your parents will be happy that you learned what hard work is so they can trust you with different things. Another thing you on a cattle boat is doing your share of work, because if you are not doing your share of work then your crew mates are going to get mad fast. Being on a cattle boat also keeps you busy so you can stay out of trouble in school or at home. All the stuff that you learn is good, but everyone wants to have some fun while doing a job.

Another reason that you should go on a cattle boat is that it is fun. No one wants to do something that is not fun. On the way back you get to play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. You can also read or whittle if you would rather do that. It also says in the article that Luke had fun on board the ship especially when they were returning. It is good to do a job that is fun to you, but also do a job that helps others and not your selve.

One last reason you should go on the trip is that it opens up your eyes to all the people who could use our help in the world. Like helping people who could use the food from the animals that you are bringing over or they could use the money that they would make by selling the animal. Like in the article it talks about Luke and how it opened up the world to him by saying ""I'm grateful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

These reasons that I have given you show why you should work on a cattle boat. You will see great sights, understand about hard work, you get to enjoy it while doing a job, and you get to help out the world by the way Luke did. So why would you pass up the chance of doing all those things by becoming a Seagoing cowboy?   ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

438648b,"Some people say that ""The Face on Mars"" is something that was built by ancient aliens, much like the theories that people come up with about the structures on Earth. Some people have even stated that the ""aliens"" could be trying to cover it up by hiding it during the time they take it. Then there are the firm believers that this is just a land mass that consists of the surroundings and resembles a mesa type biome. Since there have been developments over time, showing the different variations of the ""face"" and what it has become over the years. There are different arguements and different points of view, but there are different time periods with different variations of the same thing, so it will be proven that is is a natural land mass, and not a martian made structure.

There is a lot of things that points toward this being a natural land mass and that it is not a Martian made structure, or that the Government is trying to cover it up. One thing that shows that it is a natural structure is when the article states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough aroud Cydonia..."" This means that there are multiple things like this, but the only things that make this one different is the fact that is has ""unusual shadows"" in it that make it look human or like a structure that was built. After this happened and people got news of it and figured out it wasn't real, the Conspiracy Theorists came out and made it seem like a cover up, but this isn't true, because NASA could have gotten publicity from it, as well as many funds. This mesa is no different from anything that we have in Western United States, there we have many mesas that could look equally as strange, but we don't bother, because we want to believe that there is other life, or that there is something strange going on in other planets.

Over the years, the images of this land mass have gotten more and more clear, and we have come to realize, that no, it is not a face, but it is a large point with shadowy parts in it. From the picture from 1976, it is really blurry, and you can't really tell what it is, which is what got people hopes up and thought it may be a structure, due to the shadows and the formation around it. The 1998 one is a bit clearer, but it still is a bit unclear of what it is or could be, because it does look like it could be something like the Sphinx in Egypt, but with the same formation around it. The 2001 image looks way more clear, and this one shows something completely different than what we expected, it is just a regular mesa, with cracks, dips and shadows, and the same formation around it as before. There is something you can tell about the 2001 picture though, if you look closely, it is the same image as all the others, because you can see the dips in it where the ""eyes"" and ""mouth"" are, just more clear so they don't really show up, and since everything is more clear, you can see the cracks, which could have added to the effect.

Even after all of the theories that were made, and NASA defending themselves, as well as people trying to prove them wrong, and prove that there was something that the government did to cover it up. All of this could still be fought, who knows, there could be life out there somewhere besides on Earth, but as of now, there is no proof, and this image will still remain a natural land structure. Some people are dissapointed by this, others are motivated to keep moving and possibly one day find some signs of life, so maybe humans would be prepped and set in case of disaster. There is nothing wrong with personal opinions, but for the most part and from what pictures and plenty of evidence have proven, this is still no more than a natural occurence do to the way land forms over time. So even though people may keep looking for any signs of something that could be a conspiracy, or you just want to find something ""supernatural"" or strange, but the fact stands that there are many thing like this, and just because it is on a different planet, does not make it anymore special, and it doesn't make it any different.",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

43baa23,"The Electoral College has been kept for centuries, established by the founding fathers and established in the Constitution.  I think that the process should be maintained; so far, it has worked fine and I do not see any reason to rid of it.  The Electoral College should be continued in use because there are at least five main scenarios in which it is helpful and reasonable.

In ways, the Electoral College could be dangerous to use unless you have electors that are completely faithful in their party, and do not take advantage of getting to choose where to place their vote.  Basically, voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then elect  the president.  These electors can go against the people's majority votes and decide who to vote for.  It could also be possible that a state sends two slates of electors to elect.  If the election was a direct vote, there would be almost no chance for a tie to happen, but with the Electoral College, there is always that possiblity.  Some states do not even see the candidates because of the majority of the people living there belong to a single party, and the ""winner-takes-all"" system completely affects this.  If the elcetion were to be a direct vote, the candidates might visit the states in order to gather as many votes as possible.  However, many of these reasons that the Electoral Collge should be abolished are just one time things, so consider the other side of the argument.

Swing states basically decide the election and therefore, they are the most thoughtful voters.  They know that they will be the ones to decide the election, so they pay more attention to the news, and the candidates' campaigns.  The swing states receive the most information and attention from the candidates.  Since they will end up deciding, the candidates want them on their side.  Many sates are already pedicted, even before the election, as a majority of them are from one party.  These voters think the most about who they want to run our country and who will do the best in that position, so they should be granted the honor of making the decision.

Electoral votes help avoid run-off elections, by reducing the pressure that might complicate the election.  Say that our government referred to the direct vote system, with a lesser system known as the Electoral College was for comparison, and during the presidential election, there happened to be a problem with the popular votes versus the Electoral College; this complication could be avoided if we used the Electoral College.  This has happened with nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, when they both had only a 43 plurality of the popular votes but were winning in the Electoral College.

The Electoral College could be unwanted by many minority voters in states that leaned completely one way.  These voters hardly pay attention during the campaign because they know that their vote will hardly make a diffference in their state, but a voter's vote could not swing a complete election, and not the full population voted in the 2012 election.  Voters usually just like to express their preference and have it known than decide the vote that will make an election.  It is more likely that your vote will count if you are educated in the happenings of the government, and maybe your vote can make a difference.     ",5,3.0,3.0,,,", and awkward phrasing, detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the writing.

44ce55e,"Should we or should we not we should use computers to help identify emotions is up for debate, but in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he explains some new tech and why we should use computers to help us see emotions more clearly. D'Alto explains reasonons why they are useful in ways such as ads that can tell if you like them or not, education and telling of kids are confused or bored, and some other possible things this new technology could help with. However, I believe that even with all of our technology and advancements in many fields of it, we should not use it to help find emotions for us.

Human emotions are a very complex thing, and with that complexity it makes computers not very useful, even with their algorithims and equations. In paragraph 3 D'Alto explains how the process works ""The process begins... must move like human muscles...Eckman has classified six basic emotions...your frontalis pars lateralis... raises your eyebrows when you're surprised."" This is a pretty interesting way of seeing emotions and a very complicated one. However D'Alto writes ""your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" What he doesnt adress is other people face shaps, such as if you have naturaly small lips it doesnt mean that your angry, or that simply raising you eyebrow in a photograph means you're surprised, maybe the person is just striking a pose and nothing more. With all the people in the world, and all of them being different its hard to tell if the comupter will be able to read all of their emotions accuratly or at all.

Next, D'Alto explains to us that we use this calculation (reading people emotions) every day in paragraph 5. He says ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" In this statement he says that humans themselfs have a hard time decribing emotions on the face and what they mean sometimes. If you really think about this if we cannot describe emotions and we're the ones doing them, why should we believe a computer thats coded, by us, will be able to? Its not an easy thing to do, and even with psychologist such as Dr. Paul Eckman its a seemingly impossible task to get a non emotion giving machine the ability to read emotions, accurately.

In the article ""Making Mona Lise Smile"" Author Nick D'Alto writes about new tech and why is should be used. He provides some evidence and reasonings for things that this new technology could possibly improve or do for us. However D'Alto does not show the counter arguement in his article, and doesnt give any information on how this new tech could fail, or not work very well. Its hard to tell where computers and technology will go in the future, but with this I can say that its a almost impossible job to give a computer, not able to feel emotion, the ability to read them accuratly. Its an interesting idea to give computers and machines to ability to read emotions and possibly other advancements. But only time will tell if this new technology will be able to read our emotions. This technology could possibly put us on a path to understanding more about ourselfs, or it might fail and a new technology will start to be developed and worked on in its place. The dabate on if computers and machines reading human emotions and many other things is a big one, and only time will tell where it will end up.   ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

44d0218,"Dear Senator of Florida,

I belive the electoral college should be abolished as a process over all. The electoral college should be abolished because it does not benefit the U.S. in anyway and has caused multiple problems in elections over the past years. The electoral college should not be a part of the U.S. Constitution and it only causes issues while elections are present therefore we as a country should elect by popular vote.

The electoral college should be abloshied because it has caused multiple problems over the past years during elections and could continue to cause problems. The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their partie's candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee pesidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one inncident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford Plumer's article, in 1960 segregationists in Louisiana's legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated ""the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational."" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair.

The electoral college should not only be abolished, or destroyed, because it causes problems but also because it does not benefit the United States in any way. The outdated, unfair system just hurts the U.S. government and the country as a whole, it does not benefit our government or citizens in anyway what so ever. Under the electoral college system voters are voting for a slate of electors who don't always vote for their own party candidate rather than voting for the candidate they want to govern our country. 60% of voters would prefer direct election and popular vote anyway so why not throw out the old worn down process that dosent work and replace it with something the people of this country actually want, popular vote. Some people might say we should keep the electoral college because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee so nothing can happen but according to history things can happen such as in the 2000 election. Why keep a process that the majority of the citizens of this country don't want and a process that just causes issues.

The electoral college is a thing of the past, a has been that almost no one wants around. Popular vote elections would be more fair and will not have mistakes during elections like the huge mistakes the electoral college system has proven to display. The citizens of America want the electoral college gone and popular vote elections should be what the government is aiming for so we do not have mistakes in our elections and so the U.S. can benefit from actually having a working election process.                    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

44e0bd4,"Decreased Driving

In the past, the act of driving was a mandatory ability to possess, but as time progresses, the use of personal cars is declining. The decrease of drivers can be attributed to several events, one such event being the large quantity of greenhouse gas emissions caused by vehicles, especially cars. With society shifting to become less car centered, communities are adjusting accordingly, becoming more compressed to enable walking to ones workplace or a store. Additionally, the lowered use of cars results in a greater usage of more physical methods of transit, such as riding a bike or skating to a destination while saving the money that would have been spent on maintaining a car.

Pollution is an important issue on a global scale, having the potential to drastically impact the lives of both humans and other life forms. A large amount of pollution brings negative health effects upon most living creatures, making it essential to reduce pollution levels for the betterment of the environment. Some may think that cars don't have a large influence on pollution, but ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States,"" (Rosenthal Paragraph 5). Automobiles are responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gasses, as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" (Rosenthal Paragraph 34). The enormous amount of pollution in some areas of the world even resulted in temporary bans of personal vehicles to reduce the smog, and at one point ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" (Duffer Paragraph 10). As a result of this temporary ban in the previously smog filled city of Paris, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,"" (Duffer paragraph 14).

In order for society to shift away from the use of personal vehicles, distances between destinations must be reduced. There are experimental communities to test the effects of more compact cities, the most drastic being a Vauban, Germany, a suburb without cars. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). These compacted cities have homes and stores placed close to one another, eliminating the necessity for a car or other vehicle. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). Life within a smaller community saves the residents a lot of time which would have otherwise been spent on lengthy commutes. Additionally, through living in a less spread out society, people are more connected to one another, better learning their neighbors who are closer, while developing a deeper feeling of a community, by living in a close-knit zone. This reduction or even elimination of personal vehicle usage would enable more funds to be put toward public transport or pavement, as opposed to the current setup where ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 9).

Not only does the reduction of car use have environmental, time, and societal benefits, but there are also health as well as economic benefits to be wrought from avoiding car use. When not using a personal vehicle for transportation, other methods must be applied to reach a destination. Among these methods there are choices of public transportation, riding a bike, hiking, skating, and more. By not taking a vehicle and instead commuting by foot or bike, the commuters health improves as a result of the exercise. Many claim that traveling by other methods than a car reduces stress, one such testamony coming from businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza: ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,'"" (Selsky paragraph 24).

In addition to health benefits, there are also economic benefits, as there is no need to maintain a car when one is not in use.

In conclusion, there are various benefits to not using a car. These benefits range from improving the condition of the environment thorugh reducing pollution, as well as saving money for those not                                                    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

One of the many positive aspects of reducing car usage is that one will save money if ones car usage is reduced. In an article by Robert Duffer  called ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says: ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were orderedto leave cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)."" In Paris, car-owners were charged money for using cars on certain days. This was done in an effort to reduce traffic in the city. Another article that addresses this is ""The End of Car Culture""

by Elizabeth Rosenthal. She says: ""Part of teh explanation certainly lies in the recession,  because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars..."" Cars are a costly thing, and many people cannot afford to put the money in to having and maintaining an automobile. Car cost so much,so reducing,or even eliminating usage will save anyone a great deal of money. This is one of the many advantages to limiting car usage.

Antoher reason to limit car usage is that people tend to be less stressed,and more happy when they do not have a car to worry about. In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal, she talks about Heidrun Walter, who say thatshe is actually much happier no w that she does not own a car,and that owning a car was very stressful. No one wants to be stressed,so why would people want to put themselves through the trouble of owning a car? Lowering car usage has been shown to reduce stress, which is a good thing for people, mentally and physically. Andrew Selsky also addressesthis in ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota,"" where he says ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress.'"" As is outlined here, rducing car usage lowers stressin many people, which is definitely an advantage.

Reducing polution and greenhouse gas emissions is another advantage of limiting car usage. carscreated emissions dangerous to the environment, so reducing usage will have a positive effect on the environment. In ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota,"" Andrew Selsky discusses the mayor of Bogota, Colombia's descicion to have a day free of cars in the city. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" In Bogota, as in most cities, smog from car pollution is wide-spread. Lowering car usage lowers the levels of polution and dangerous emissions in cities. A similar situation is outlined in Robert Duffer's ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says ""After days of near-record polution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This gives further evidence that reducing car usage will lower pollution and smog in cities around the world. Concurrently, Elizabeth Rosenthal, in her artilce ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" she says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emisssions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" This provides further evidence that cars release an enormous amount of pollution, and usage must be lowered.

Limtiting ones car usage has many positive consequences, some of these include saving money, reducing stress, and lowering polution levels. These are all great reasons to limit car usage, and many people are beginning to take hold of these advantages around the world.            ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

451c89c,"The use of facial technology in a classroom is a fantastic idea. If a teacher knows how a student is feeling maybe behavior problems could be avoided. Test scores could start to rise because if a teacher knows how you are feeling maybe they can adjust their teaching a little, so you might understand more. Just think of all the possibilities that could happen if a school used facial technology.

Students get angry throughout the day and so do teachers. If you are hiding you are not angry and then one thing tips your boat, that can cause a big scene to occur. With the new facial technology things like this could be avoided because whoever is in your classroom would know how you are feeling today. It might even be a good thing to use this technology on teachers, not just students. Teachers get angry and upset too, so using this technology could help a student know that their techer is struggling a little bit and maybe to give him or her an easier day. This could also allow the students to help better the teachers mood so things may get a little better for him or her.

Now test scores could really benefit from this new technology. If a tecaher knows when a student is bored or confused then the lesson could become modified. The teacher would know that maybe one student or even the whole class is not understanding what is being taught. The teacher could then do whatever they think is right and try and fic the lesson. At the bottom of paragraph two Dr. Huang says what I stated in the sentence above. Think about it, test scores would sky rocket if teachers knew that a student was still confused, but maybe was afriad to ask a question. If the techers also knows a student is afraid to ask a question then that could help the teacher know to maybe boost the student's cofidence more. If a teacher could find all of that out maybe he or she could simply run through the lesson again or ask the student if he or she might need a little extra help. In paragraph three is says that this technology can already identify six basic emotions and fear is one, so if more emotion are learned and recongnized then the teacher could really help solve a problem. Many possibilities could and will come with this technology.

Students could use this not only with teachers, but also with their friends. Kids tend to joke around and not realize when they are hurting someones feelings. This could allow these kids to know when too far has occured. Like almost all kids some are afraid to stand up and say that something has hurt their feelings. This new technology may help the problems with bullying. Maybe the bystanders of the bullying would see how truly upset the attacked person is feeling. Kids do a really good job at pretending things do not hurt them, but in reality they hurt them a lot. I know the article does not say anything about this but this is a huge possibility this could be used for. We want to help kids so why not do it this way.

This technology would help so much in a school. many problems occur in schools, that could potentionally be bypassed with this technology. Students and teachers could all benefit from this technology. Who is to say that if it works in a school that more advancements could come out of this new technology. We have no idea what the future holds, but this could be a big part of our future and helping us to unerstand each other a little more. ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

452c84b,"Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms. It may sound far fetched, but actually, FACS may be the best thing to come to schools because of its flexible learning and the ability to read the students.

In the education world, teachers are the backbone of the infestructure. Without teachers, the whole system would collapse. However, it may be hard for one teacher to connect with every student individually and make sure they are learning properly or if they are paying attention. This is where FACS comes in. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Dr. Huang talks about FACS in classrooms more in depth, ""'A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human istructor.'"" With FACS, every child could essentially have a customized lesson plan exactly for their needs. This would make children more eager to learn because they begin to enjoy it. Besides the classroom, FACS could also be used in the school elsewhere. One of the other important areas this could be used is in counceling.

It is very hard for anyone to tell someone they are sad. This is especally true when they barely know the person they are talking to. This can be the case for school councelors and the children they are meeting with. FACS may be able to help. With FACS, the school could see if children are upset or scared. The school could also see how often these children feel this way. When a child is unhappy or scared, it is very unlikely that they are going to be doing their work at full capacity. If FACS could find these children that need help, they could be helped faster. This could also be used to find children being bullied. If the child is feeling scared around another student, or if a child is afraid of a classroom, they could be helped because FACS was able to read them. FACS may even be able to detect if a child is afraid of leaving school. With FACS, it's like every child in school has someone that is looking out for them, even if no one else is. It may be true that some children might not want people to know about this, that they may want to hide it. However, it is never healthy to hide such strong emotions, especally if there are people around you willing to help.

With the constant evoultion of the way we learn, its not suprising that something like FACS was created. Emotions have been with everything living since the beginning of time. Before FACS, it was suprisingly difficult to read these emotions in people. Such a crucial part of our everyday lives could be easily hidden away by a fake smile or a theatre tear. But now that there is FACS helping out, looks are no longer decieving.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

45310cd,"The author believes that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. This is how he supports his idea. He thinks that Venus would be a worthy pursuit because it seems like Venus was once very much like earth. Like Earth, Venus seems to have a similar features such as a surface of rocky sediment and other familiarfeatures such as valleys, mountains, and craters(paragragh 4). The author stating all that detail supports his idea because if Venus has similar geological features as Earth, then it might mean that sometime in the far future we might have a chance of actually visiting the planet and learning much more about it and just that chance alone could make Venus a worthy pursuit.

Venus doesnt really have the most welcoming conditions but there may be a solution for that. The author supports his idea very well here because he states that NASA has a possible solution to those harsh conditions. A blimp-like vehicle that floats 30 or so miles above the Venusian landscape, it would be high enough for the tempurature to stay around 170 degree Fahrenheit. Although its still not an easy condition, humans can still survive it(paragragh 5). The author using this to support his idea is very awesome because it gives a solution to one of the reason why we can't really go to Venus. He goes on to talk about how using simplified electronics made up of silicon carbide could be the answer. Scientist tested the electronics in a chamber that simulate a a condition much like how it would be on Venus, it lasted 3 weeks in those conditions(paragragh 7). These all supports his idea very well because it shows that scientists are making progress and might be able to actually make a machine that can survive on Venus long enough to collect rocks and other things that could help scientist learn moreabout the planet. The more the scientist learn about to the planet, the more solution that they can come up with to combat Venus's harsh condition.

Last but not least he states that striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. He also said that our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation(paragragh 8).

4547adf,"America was built upon the foundation known as democracy, yet we have been desecrating on what we believe in for years. I am talking about the elctoral college, the process of picking a president or senator through voting for what an elector decides on and acts as a representative for what a certain region decides to vote for. From the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the elctors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral vites by Congress."" I do not believe that the elctoral college is a wise decision as it being the process of voting for our next leader.

Many people disagree with my opinion and there are a few reasons why, that even I support. From the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president,"" by Richard A. Posner, he states that the outcome is certain when applying electoral college to a vote, while a dispute can be more likely to occur using the popular vote method. However, thye elctorial college can even decrease the percentage of voters in the country. There are Democrats in Texas while California has Republicans. This means that there are elctors who already know what they're voting for and the candidates only visit ""swing"" states or states who have no preference on what party they are voting for. This will decrease the chance of voters to vote in a state that already knows what party the electors of their state will vote for.

I agree on the basis that vote by popular election is more applicable to the situation of voting rather than by electoral college. One reason is the mess-up that occured on the presidential election voting in 2000. The problems of the electoral college is the reason why Florida screwed up and George Bush became president rather than Al Gore, who won the popular vote. Taken from the Article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer,""Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote, but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

Another reason as stated by Plumer's article,""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What would happen if there is a tie on the votes the elector gets? Would the elector simply choose one or the other or might not even vote at all. I also believe that it is unfair that each state gets the number of electors based on the population of the state. If California was Republican while Idaho could be for Democrats, then both do not have an equal value because California has more people. Overall, electoral college seems sophisticated but whatever happened to being ""plain and simple?"".

Voting through the popular vote method seems much easier and much better than voting within a certain region counts as one vote. It would be much simpler if every vote of every single person counted as it's own vote for the president, not for an elector. This makes your vote not seem that worthy and is the cause of discouragement of voting. From the Office of the Federal Register it states that, ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" There is proportional representation or statistics involved, simply who gets more takes it and it would be unfair to each person with this method.

In conclusion, the elctoral college is an out-dated process for electing a president and should be changed to whoever, wins the popular vote because deep-down, the people are the key figure in voting. With this process, you are undermining you, your state, and even your country by continuing with this absurd and unnescessary process when it could be all voted and decided, ""by the people and for the people.""            ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

4575e69,"Prof. Thomas Huang, Prof. Nicu Sebe and Dr. Paul Eckman have been able tro design, read and determine emotions using a computer software called Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Using this technology, they were able to make a computer generated 3-D model of the face in this world famous painting. Using the muscles that lay underneath the skin in this 3-D model, the software is able to determine the emotion of the person based off of the physical characteristics and movement of the muscles.

In using the FACS software ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored' predicted Dr. Huang"" (paragraph 6). Much like a classroom instructor, the computer and software will be able to modify the lesson and instruction to further engage and explain to the student.

However, in a classroom, it seems that teachers will rarely change lesson plans to engage their students, and will further explain only if a specific question is asked, regardless of the look of confusion of the students' faces.

Futhermore, teachers and program writers would have to code for and write many forms of the lesson to explain or engage the students before uploading it to the computer for lessons. If a student is bored or confused, the software and computer system will have to be able to 1) recognze the facial expression and 2) choose from several lesson plans to fit and better the facial expression of the student/user.

As a student, I do not find myself to be facially expressive on the computer, in fact the only expresson I have is within my mind, while my face remains blank. This would make it impossibke for the FACS to identify bordom or confusion. There is also the possiblilty of the software confusing one of these facial expressions with that of concentration when reading or writing.

The article states that "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" (Paragraph 7) If the same algorithms (FACS) would be used to determine the facial feature of Mona Lisa and her expression to aid the computer in determining the facial characteristics and emotions of a student. At our 1-on-1 technology based school, students can either rent laptops or provide their own for school work. If our personal computers cannot store the algorithms of FACS to determine the facial features of students then it would be entirely useless. The school would have to purchase entirely new computers for every student in the school, with the RAM and capacity to read emotions and contain the FACS. These computers would have to be laptops so they can be transported between classes, school and home. This would be too costly for the school or students and improbable in being able to find and provide the correct kiond of computer.

If the FACS needs to be able to computer generate a 3-D model of the face, the computer would run signifigantly slower because it is trying to read your emotions and run any other programs you have open for your class work. Unlike the Mona LIsa, our faces are already three-dimensional, however the computer software would have to be able to generate a computer model of the students face and expression by examining the muscles underneath in the model, which in all liklihood would take much longer to complete than it does for an expression to change or the comprehension of a subject ot take place.

To conclude, although the Facial Action Coding System would hypothetically work to decide emotions, it would be entirely too costly, time consuming, and unlikey in te effectivness of being able to read the expressions of students during class.",5,2.0,2.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

461515a,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I am writing you concerning a topic that is very important to our country, and the citizens that preside in it. The electoral college is the current method of determining who will be elected as the president of the United states of America. As you know, it does so by allowing our citizens to vote for electors that then choose who they want as president for us. Citizens will most often vote for an elector that has sworn to vote for either the democratic or republican party's candidates for president. However, I don't quite agree with this method of election. Through my research on this subject, I have discovered that not only do these citizens not have the access to vote directly for who they want to run their country, but also that many electors go back on their word and vote for another party's candidate. I believe the system should be changed and the president should be elected through popular vote, and I'm not alone, according to a Gallup poll taken in 2000, over 60% of the population agrees with me.

If the popular vote elects the president, every citizen will have their own choice on who they want as a president. In an electoral college, many people will merely have their votes casted aside becausetheir decisions or thoughts aren't the same as eveyone else in their state. Though some people say an electoral college is positive because it requires the candidateto have more than just regional appeal, but if people in that state like a specific candidate, even if they vote for an elector, the rest of their state may not like that candidate, and that person's vote will be cast away.

Also, the electoral college doesn't always follow the peoples' vote. For example, if there were to be a tie in the electoral college, the election would be given to the

House of Representatives. Since many people vote for a different party candidate than who they vote for, for the House of Representatives, they would not get their vote for president counted for anything, and the House may choose the president they don't want, without getting a say in any of it. Not to mention the 2000 election when Al

Gore got more votes overall, but Bush won the presidency due to the unfair, outdated system of the electoral college. The electoral college puts the decision of who will be the president into a couple hundred peoples' hands, instead of every American citizen.

Another reason for changing the method  to popular vote is the fact that all of the electors count the same. Since each state only counts for one electoral vote, the one elector from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, will count for the same as the 55 electors from, California, who represent 35 million voters. That simply isn't fair because it's the same as saying the opinions of only 500,000 voters in Wyoming are as influencial and important  as the entire 35 million voters' opinions from

California. The fact that not all American citizens, promised to be able to vote for who will lead their country and influence their everyday life, are able to do so is absurd.

Many people argue and say that just one vote won't make a difference, but there are 34,500,000 people in California alone that are being disregarded and not counted for anything more than the 500,000 in Wyoming.

Why should the people living in smaller states have more influence than those with larger populations? Why shouldn't those 34.5 million people in California be able to make their own decision and choose their own vote for the President? The entire population of every single state in the United States of America, that has the legal right to do so, should be able to vote, and to have their vote actually counted for something instead of just having their decision made for them by someone they've never even met. With the popular vote deciding who will be president, everyone will matter just the same, which is how it should be since we are all created equal, and we all should have the equal power to decide how our country will be governed and who will govern it, we should all be counted; not just the small percentage that is at the top. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Your fellow Floridian and American,

46b1195,"You get upearly on November 6, 2012 ready to vote, because every vote counts! But does it really? Instead  of your vote going directly towards who you want as president, it goes towards the electoral collge and then they decide who really wins the presidency. The Electoral College ia a system where instead of the people vote for the president, a group of electors choose the next leader of the free world. I fervently believe that we should abolish the Eletoral College sytem, and change the election of popular ovte because it is an injustice, outdated, and irrational.

The Electoral College system is highly unfair. The voters wnat to elect the president that they would like, and in order to do that their vote should be significant. Although  the Electoral Collge system is at times efficent, it still does not satisify the voters. The people aren't even the ones who get an actual say on who their next president will be. Even the people who are in defense of the Electoral College System agree, ""It is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" (15), says Richard A. Posner author of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing president."" In the 2000 elections, candidate Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, and won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral college vote so he lost the presidency. If this is supposedly a ""free"" country with a democratic system, then shouldn't the citizens have the right to pick the individual that will be running their country for the next four years?

Some electors may not even vote with the majority. Voters can't control who their electors vote for. The electors are even sometimes picked by the presidential candidate running for office, how does it seem fair that a group of people that hold the fate of our country in their hands is chosen by soemone who would be highly affected by their decision.

It is also an injustce because of the way the votes count. If you live in a state with a higher population, your state gets more electoral votes. The amount of electors depends on the amount of senators and representatives your state has. There is one elector per representative, and two per senator. There is a total of 538 electors, and to win presidency the candidate mst have at least 270 or higher. For example sya you live in Iowa, where there are only four electors, the vote doesn't count as much as the votes in California or Florida.  The system is completely outdated too. The Electoral College system has been around for hundreds of yars,a dn it is not up to date with our modern times, so it is a complete waste to use it.                        ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

46df9c0,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a a butte/mesa landform on Mars, that has started a huge controversy between skeptics and Nasa, because it depicts a human face. At first we were skeptical about the validity of this landmark, and we were not sure about what it really was. Some of our other scientists got on the case and according to paragraph 12 of the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" article, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West. People were not going to easily accept this easily.

According to paragraph 5 in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" article,

""It has starred in a Holywood film,. appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--evne haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"". This transformed

and fueled people to start being skeptical about wheather or not it was a sign of life or not. They started to deny that me and other scientists at NASA were telling the truth and even thought that we would rather hide it then tell anyone. I can prove that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform on Mars because, we have taken high quality pictures on a clear day of the landform, we would share with the world if their was life on Mars, and we have studied it enough to see it is just a rock, thats shadows that make it appear as a face.

The first piece of evidence of this Face just being a landform is that we have taken the highest quality pictures possible, and we even did it on a clear day. The pictures were way more high quality then the original pictures, and accoriding to passage 10 ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This showed clear as day what the ""Face on Mars"" really looked like. We then even took more pictures on a clear day because people started to speculate and according to passage 8 ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Us scientists decided we had to take it on a clear day, so we did and now we can tell you that is 100% what the landmark looks like.

The second piece of evidence for the Face only being a natural landform is that if we knew their was life on Mars we would tell the people. We would make a lot of money and we would be able to keep NASA going and get enough money to keep funding us. According to passage 5 ""Some people think that the ""Face on Mars"" is a bona fide evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This just proves my point of we would tell the people, and we would let everyone know because their is no reason for us to hide this from the people, and we would make a lot of money and would be able to keep funding NASA.

The last piece of evidence about the ""Face on Mars"" just being a natural landform is that we have observed the landform for long enough, and according to paragraph 12""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" This proves my point of us being able to identify just from the picture that it is a butte or a mesa, and it is easy for us to know, because we already have some all across the American West. We also know according to paragraph 3 that ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This shows that we have observed this landform for long enough and taken enough pictures that we can identify that it is just a landform that has shadows that just make it portray a human face.

In conclusion me and other scientists at NASA know what we are doing, and would like to inform everyone that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform. We would tell the people about this as quick as possible if it really wasn't, and we would not try to hide it from the public at all. I hope all skeptics understand that we have enough evidence to believe that this is not a human face, that is just a landform, that we have taken enough pictures to understand what it is, and that there is nothing to worry about.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

Mr. Goldberg an official of transportation for America, a growing coalition to promote car frees communities said. The world is changing for the better and one of the machines man created, that is one of the world changing invenions of it's time is coming down for it's throne is the car. So what are the reasons for not getting a car? lets find out.

In Germany, that is coming faster than people think. An idea called ""Smart planning' is taking hold in an exprimental town bulit in 2006 named Vauban. A place were cars are a thing of the past. People everyday are not driving to school or work they are walking, bicycling, or taking the tram into the town from the suburb. Smart planning is revoultionary buliding towns to not be dependent on driving. 70% of Vauban's famlies do not own car and are much happier to not have the everyday anxiteys of driving a motor engine car everyday. 57% sold there car just to move into the small town of Vauban. Car free suburbs and town are a growing trend all across Europe, the united states and many more nations. These efforts have been making cities, towns, and suburbs denser so you don't have to go far to get some milk and eggs.

The global warning is a huge part of the fight to make the earth our home more better and healthier for generations and generations to come. Cars emit gas emissions that make up 12% of the greenhouse gases in our enviroment, up to 50% percent in car-intensive areas in the United States and around the world.

France, Paris having heavy smog decided to have a partial ban on driving making even numbered license plates not drive or fear a fine. Congestion went down after the experiment. What was to blame for the smog was the Diesel fuel being used in most cars because of the fact that a tax policy favors diesel fuel over gasoline. Paris having more smog than the typical capital had a decrease in congestion and the citiy after enormous victory decided to go at it again and do odd numbered license cars.

The car culture is one the has had enormous effect on the everyday lives citizens around the world. In the United states, ""Recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" In America where the car culture has turned us into the number one place in the world to find the history of one of the planets world changing innventions. People want a greener earth and benifits of not owning a car because everybody knows the stress of having a car no matter ho much it helps you. The car in which you have to have insurance, life insurance, car payments, you have to keep up with your car, the dangers associated with having a car and stress plus anxiety that comes with a car. The cons outweight the pros but those pros have an enormous effect. People are changing and the percentile of teenagers and young adults have droped ten fold in getting or renewing a license. The new trend is that people are no longer getting cars or licenses so why should you.

The people of planet earth understand the pros or cons of a car the benifits of not diving and are making for that change. One of the worlds greatest innventions is stepping off there throne. So why will you not get a car?    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

4720230,"Over many years, technology has become more and more advanced. Some of this technology has become so far that it can now detect human facial expression and determine what emotion they are expressing. This technology is called Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology, and it enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology can have a positive impact in school classrooms today. FACS can help improve the way students learn in schools, they way teachers teach their students, and most simportantly, help teachers detect when a student is feeling confused.

One of the main positive impacts FACS can have in reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is improve the way students learn. FACS can scan the facial expressions of the students in the classroom and determined if the majority of the students are confused by the leasson the teacher is teaching. FACS could then modify the lesson in a way that students can understand it and the teacher can then further clarify the lesson the way FACS shows it. As stated in pargraph six, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrctor"", this shows how FACS can help teachers in the way they teach. This could also explain to teachers how to clarify even more the lesson to students that may be going through hard times.

Another way FACS can have a great impact in schools all around the country is by improving the way teachers teach their classrooms. FACS can detect many expressions on students in a classroom. It can detect whether a student is perplexed by lesson or simply just bored. FACS can detect which students in the classroom are bored by analazing their facial expressions. As stated in pargraph six, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". FACS can then provide the teacher many ways in which they can make the lesson more interesting so that students can comprehand it better and in a more fun way.

The last way in which FACS can greatly improve the teaching environment in schools is by recognizing when a student is depressed or sad. FACS can detect facial expressions on students faces and determine if they may be going through trouble or are depressed. As stated on pargraph six, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". FACS could recognize when a student is not okay so that teachers can the help those students who may need help, wether that is emotional help or help with school work. FACS could even help save lifes by getting help to students who may be contemplaiting suicide.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can be extremely valuable to schools all around the world. This computer system can help teachers improve the way they teach their classrooms by analazing students' emotional expressions towards a certain lesson. It can help teachers by modifying their lessons in sich a way so that students are not bored or confused by it. Lastly, it can help teachers know which students may be going through hard times and help those who need help.              ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

475637e,"Self Driving cars, we've seen them in movies and on television. Not science fiction anymore. Google has been trying to develop a fully self-driving car, that consumers can buy and use. Not most people are against these potential dangerous vehicles, because of the driver's lack of control and the fear of something failing in the car. In fact, some people are so afraid of letting these things on the street, that some states for example, California, Nevada, Florida, and even the District of Columbia, have put down laws to prevent these potentially dangerous tools on the streets. I am all for these new advancements in traveling technology, because they will help to reduce crashes, braking would be much more easier to detect, and they will for sure keep their drivier's eyes locked on the road.

Now will many car crashes happening every year, people might assume that a slf driving car, not aware of the things surrounding it, would be more likely to cause a crash then regular cars...right? Wrong! Google, the company trying to develop these machines, have found out ways of preventing even more crashes in these vehicles. First, they actaully took a Toyata Prius, and attached a camera, sensors, and even a GPS reciever to the car. The GPS would help guide the thing, the sensors would help with braking and knowing if something is near by or coming towards the person inside, and the camera would as well, help the driver out when on the road. The camera also revovles constantly on the roof and creates a 3D model of the car's surroundings to help out the driver. Don't believe it would work? What if I told you they actually tested it, and the car made it mkore then half a million miles with a crash! Yeah!

Now of course some drivers are either on their phone or doing something else to even pay attention to the road and what's ahead. Yeah, you know who you are. Now of course Google has figured out a solution to those problems as well. Some of these things I've already mentioned, so I won't go into too much detail. For one the self driving car would have the LIDAR sensor camera to help make you aware of the surroundings. Now there will be a camera inside to make sure the person is focused on the road, and if thy aren't will send a ""wake-up"" call to the driver to make them do what they need to do. Now one downside is the self driving cars they said would also have entertainment, that is another thing to distract the driver, but they fugured out that problem as well. They made it to where when the driver needs to focus on the road, the tech you're on would immediately switch itself off, to let the driver know that something is gonna happen, unlike phones that don't do that, again increasing the probability of crashing.

Now the driver's eyes are most important while driving. A driver must be fully aware of it's surroundings, or else something could happen to them, or somebody else. Google realized this as well, and added a few new features. Again, a few of these things I might have already talked about, so I won't go into too much detail. A camera would be inside the vehicle to allow a person to watch the driver, to make sure their doing what they're supposed to be doing, and even though it's a self-driving car, the camera will also make sure that the person's hands are on the steering wheel as well. Now again, I don't like that they decided to put in entertainment for the driver, distracting them and increasing the chances of a crash, but again they took care of that by making them immediately switch off whenever the car believes that it's in danger.

Now then, are self driving cars okay to use? Right now I think they're decent enough to use, but not ready for consumer use. I mean even though they did keep in mind the negatives and the positives to these cars, they still need a little more work, in my opinion. But I do believe they will be ready to use, and will be safe because of the new features they added, but get rid of that entertainment part of the car!",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

483dea4,"The limitation of car use provides many improvements to our envionment and health. Many different places have now started to get into the habit of preferring to use bicycles, car-pools, or even walking. Limiting car use could lead to less polution, more activity, and even safety. If we were to limit the use of cars, we could save many lives, including our own. While limiting the usage of cars many doors could open that leads many different places. Limiting cars could possibly terminate childhood and adulthood obesity. It could also provide happiness and joy, and even willing exercise. Cars both hinder, and help us, it gets the people where they need to go, but it ruins the environment and makes many people  lathargic.

With the limitation of cars comes the major improvement on polution.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (1, Rosenthal). Passenger cars are responsible for 12 precent of the greenhouse emissions found in Europe, and where most cars are used the greenhouse gass emissions are up to 50 percent. The amount of gas that is polluting the air is asoultly hazardous to the health of many people. ""...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" (1, Duffer). Paris eventually needed to ban driving due to the smog that was being produced from the cars. As stated in the ariticle, ""...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" (1, Rosenthal). If we were to limit the car usage, many smog and greehouse gases would not be as much of an issue as it is now. If we were to limit the usage of cars and prefer to car-pool, alot of gas, money, and lives. With the limiting of car usage comes the possibility of living a longer, healthier life without pollution tearing a hole in the ozone layer.

Limiting the use of cars can also produce more activity among the people and hapiness. Limiting the use of cars forces many people to start walking, using trains, running, and even bicycling. As states in the article, ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nations"" (1, Rosenthal). Many places are now starting to realize that the people are slowly loosing interest in cars and now perfer to walk, run, or even take public transportation. As stated in the articaly, ""..millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work leaving a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.... 'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution'"" (1, Selsky). ""It has seen the construction of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American cirt....Parks and sports centers also have bloomes throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (1, Selsky). Many citizens are starting to prefer to walk rather than drive. The perople are slowly moving away from motor vehicles and are starting to go outside and to exercise. As mentioned in the article, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (1, Rosenthal) This choice is making alot most people happy and satified.  Many people no longer need to fret about gas money or traffic, or even about arriving on time. Having no car is a stress-reliever that saves you time, stress, and keeps you from pulling at your hair. Exercising is also a much easier way to be able to blow off steam and reduce stress.

Another positive of limiting car use is the safety that is provided. Many Americans are now choosing to not recieve a license. The people are slowly moving away from the driving of cars and are now preferring to use public transportation, or even walking. People are now slowly starting to center their lives around where it could be easy to transport. Their place of work could now be centered around where public transport is able to drop them off, a walking distance, or even on the normal route that a friend, whom you could be able to catch a ride, wouldn't mind dropping you off at. As stated in the article, ""They organize their summer jobs and soical life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends"" (1, Rosenthal).  Another reason why many people do not drive, is due to the fact that many families and people cannot afford a vehicle, or they choose to not purchase one. As stated in the artice, ""'What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn'"" (1, Rosenthal). With less amount of people on the road, this lowers the possible chances of someone being in an accident. The possibility of poeple being in car accident have been lowered, because a majority of the people are refusing to drive. As mentioned in an artice, ""When adjusted to the population growth, th enumber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short...the number of miles driven perperson was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"" (1, Rosenthal). If the people were to drive less this would mean less accidents and less pollution which could lead to lenghtier lives and to healthier lives.

In conclusion, with the limitation on the use of automobiles comes the many possibilities that could possibly save lives and re-shape them into something much more healthier. While reducing the usage of automobiles comes exercise and the relief os stress. Maybe childhood or adulthood obesity would not be as large of an issue if were reduced car usage. Many people could then be healthier and more involeved in their communities. With the limitation of car usage comes the unlimited possibilities.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

485dbac,"To many, it is a necessity. To others, its a waste of money. Cars have been a growing industry ever since the Model-T, but over the last few years automobiles may soon start to look like a thing of the past. There have been many efforts to reduce car use because it is better for the enviorment, creates a more social atmosphere, and the best of all it is cheaper.

Could you imagine major streets, cities, and highways almost deserted of those four wheeled gas guzzlers? Well annualy in Bogota, Columbia citizens participate, or for many ""celebrate"" no car day. Other forms of transportation such as skating, biking, or walking are very common as violaters of no car day face twenty five dollar fines. Many enjoy the holiday like Carlos Plaza, who rode his two-seat bike to work with his wife. It is a day to be socializing with others, not locked up in your vehicle but to get out and enjoy the fresh air before it is all polluted and blown out the exhaust. The day alone has caused a blooming of parks, and restraunts throughout the city. With less drivers out on the road, this day is traffic free and extremely safe as well. This is not only a common trend in Colombia, but is beginning to be seen in the United States as well. Teens have begun using their summer-life to being in carpools or riding the bus to not only get around enviormentally, but to also meet and be with freinds and develop a more social community. This can be seen through carpooling apps and cell phones to arrange other forms of transportation.

Over the years there has been a push to use more eco-friendly cars such as hybrids, or electric cars. But what about not driving a car at all? Many have made this change in Vauban, Germany where residents of this upper-class community have gone motor free, and given up cars. This suburban area alone is a  huge effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, similar to citizens in paris who have lost their driving privledges due to the extreme ammount of smog in their city. By banning odd numbered plates from driving on monday, and even numbered plates from driving on tuesday, pedestrians hopped on trams and bicycles to commute the rest of their day. Each time you firie up your engine, carbon monoxide and other pollutious gas is released into the atmosphere, causing a widening hole in the ozone layer affecting Global Warming. In this two-day restriction, smog was significantly reduced throughout the city.

Many gimmance and frown as they fill up their gas tank, knowing they just spent forty dollars on gasoline, and will be right back at the same pump next week. Money makes the world go around, and spending less on cars, highways and other expenses could brighten anyones day. It is absolutely free to get to work on a bicycle, and New Yorks bike sharing program has significantly jumped inthe last few years as many would rather use manpower than horsepower to travel. Not just bikes but other services are cheaper as well like taking the bus, the few dollars for a bus pass or a train ticket is much less than a new toyota. The infamous no car day in Colombia has influenced money to be spent on wide, and smooth sidewalks for bikers instead of million dollar highways. Due to the recession, many are not buying cars or getting their license simply because they dont have the resources to afford one. Some believe the idea of a personal car is impractical says Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Bill believes it is best to use the comercial network of transportation for its lower cost, eco friendly, and a safer enviorment on the road.

Since the beginning of man all forms of transportation have been used, but are cars starting to become a thing of the past? On paper, the idea of not owning personal cars looks great. The enviorment would improve significantly, daily interactions with comuting to work develops a more social enviroment, and is of course cost reductive.

Two, it can people get help if they always come to class with a sadness emotion on their face. Third, is that it can help with lessons being taught.

First, which is bringing the truth out of people. Now, I think this is valuable, not just to the classroom, but in the real world. This valuable in the classroom because it can identify whether a student is lying or telling the truth to his or her teacher at the time. This is essential because it goes along with my reason of that this technology helps with the lesson. This can help interpret if the student or students, are lying if you say if they know what is going on, and not confused.

Secondly, is that you will be able tell if a student or students are upset or not. I feel like this is important because it can be hard for the student(s) to concentrate on the lesson if they are too busy thinking about why they are upset. With the right attitude the teacher can help the student(s) get their education. Another reason why this is important because it can save lives of people that suffering from depression. This can help lower the amount of deaths in a year because it can help recognize that a student may need some psychological help. For example, in the passage it says,""...the software can identify mixed emotions.""This is important because it can tell what you are feeling inside. The teacher can maybe help the people cheer up and get on with the day's lesson.

Third, is that it can help with the lesson. Now this is very essential because it can help determine if the students are confused or bored. This is important because some students may be afraid to be one of the only ones to be confused of the subject. This is something o be recognized because it o decide to continue with the lesson or to move on to a different one of interest. As said in the passage,""A classroom computer could recognize when a studetn is bored or confused.""Also said,""Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""These quotes help get my point across because it shows that it can help recognize if the student is in a place of boredom or dispair.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in classrooms because it can help makes the teacher's job easier. Which can also help the students by, it recognizing if somone is being truthful , to help notice if a student may be upset for some odd reason, and that it can help the teacher know if the lesson that they previously just did needs some more work, or if he or she can move forward on to a different lesson.

48b152e,"Dear Florida Senator,

I am here to tell you about the electoral collage, and not why we should keep the horrible thing, but how we can replace it with something better. The electoral collage has been in use for a very long time, since the Constitution was finalized, but it should end now. The Electoral Collage is a confusing system that can easily be manipulated and changed to benifit one political party. As shown in many past elections, it has just become another reason people do not want to vote. Popular vote is easy and simple and it should be used in future elections.

First of all confusion is a huge factor when talking about  the Electoral collage. We as voters do not want all these processes. We do not want hoops that we want to jump through. We are simple people who want a simple process. In the electoral collage,  there are 538 electors, with a majority of 270 needed to be voted in as president. Each state gets entitled to two for your senators, and one for each member of the House of Representatives. This so far is making my head spin. This could be so much simpler if we just used the poular voting system. In this system, the people can directly vote for thier president without any huge hassel. This makes it easier and more fair for the voters. Speaking of fair, lets talk about how Unfair the Electoral Collage is.

In the Electoral Collage, there is no partial winning. It is a winner take all system, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. This makes it very unfair to votes. Swing states add on to this idea. Swing states are very large states that have a higher representation in the Electoral collage. These are also the main targets of presidential cannidates. By getting these swing states, cannidates can gain a lot of votes in one state. This leaves other states, such as Ohio and Montana with little to no interaction from the presidential cannidates. This is not fair. We need the popular vote system. We need to be able to equally represent everyone without any shady practices. And that is the last topic, the electors really control the final outcome.

The final sin of the electoral collage is just too big to look over. The electoral collage can change wether a person is voted in or not because of the electors. They choose who they represtent. If you can not see where this is going let me explain. A set of people who want a specific president can just represent him. This could go so far as to leave a state with only representatives of one cannidate. This could never happen in popular vote because we don't have electors, we have people. We have real American people who want to vote for who they want to vote for. Nothing more, nothing less.

Even though the Electoral Collage seems like th root of all evil, there are a few upsides. First, there is less likely to have a dispute than a popular vote. A dispute is not impossible, it is just less likely. Second, big states are weighted how they should be. They are larger states that comprise most of the population and the country. They should be represented more than smaller states. Finally, since it is a winner takes all, there are no Run-Off elections. This keeps the process shorter, but not as short as it would be in the popular vote system.

So to conclude, popular vote should be used in upcomming elections. The electoral collage is a confusing system that can easily be manipulated to help or hurt a specific cannidate. Although the electoral collage properly represent smaller states and avoids Run-Off elections, it does not represent smaller states and can easly shift the election from one side to another. Popular vote keeps the process short and makes it fair. It represents everyone fairly. I do not want you to agree with me, I want you to look and the cold hard facts. Popular vote should be used in the Election from now on.

48b771c,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" The author stated both positive and negative stances on the topic of driverless cars. This topic is very controversial when bringing in the aspect of safety and the well-being of others around the driverless car. And, because of that I believe driverless cars are not a good idea to bring into society.

First, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because drivers could get reckless at the wheel. In the text it stated that ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" meaning that at some point the driver would have to help the car navigate at times when the car couldn't(7). Which imposes that the drivers would have to be aware of his/her surroundings at all time when the time was needed for them to take the wheel again. But, doesn't that defeat the purpose of the car being driverless. No one would want a driverless car that still needs to be driven? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive""(8). And the most important question is, what would drivers do to pass the time when they're not driving. They could distract theirselves with their phones, music or any passengers which could cause them to miss out on any important message from the car telling them to drive or take over in the needed situation. This is where the reckless aspect of the driverless car comes in. Missing the important message could cause accidents and harm to other drivers or pedestrians. And, this cause of harm to others around leads to my next argument against driverless cars and that is lawsuits.

Second, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of who would be to blame if accidents did happen. In the text it explained how new laws would have to be created to go along with the cars when they are proved to be ""more reliably safe""(9). But what would happen ""If the technology fails and someone is injured""(9). This issue could cause many lawsuits filed against innocent ""drivers"" and many lawsuits filed against companies who were not aware of the issue with the cars technology. Sometimes things happen and because technology can not be trusted 100% of the time these cars should not be able to exist. Lives could be on the line and many people who were not to blame will take the blame for this mishap. The car could just cause a million more problems instead of solving the laziness of humans will not to want to drive.

Lastly, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of its proness to being hacked. Anything in the world could be hacked. Anyones phone can be hacked, computers can be hacked and even intelligence units can be hacked. So, if these things can be hacked then what makes one think that this driverless car can't be hacked. And, if hacked there would be no telling what the hacker could do to the car. For example, cause it to crash or lead the car into an area the driver in unfamiliar with because they're not paying attention. These examples could all cause harm to more than just the driver and that shows why this car should not be implemented into society, because it has various accounts on how it can misfunction.

These examples of recklessness, misblaming and hacking all show why the idea of having driverless cars are not a good idea. They can mess up society and cause harm in more ways than it could help society. Although the car is a very unique way of showing advancement in the technological world, one would have tot look at both sides before concluding whether or not this is a good idea, and in this case it seems that the bad outweighs the good.

49f24e5,"The idea of a driverless car has always been the goal set for future technology. This is seen in the constant stream of futuristic movies or shows. However, those only convey the positive and idealistic aspects of such vehicles. The ignorance of the negative information associated with them causes a personal disbelief in the cars. Driverless cars should not be developed due to the overwhelming evidence including that development/testing is against the law in the majority of the world due to the idea of possible malfunctions or irresponsible road behavior from the passengers.

A vast majority of people agree that testing should not occur due to possible danger. The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" speaks about how traffic laws are currently written to include human control of the vehicle in Paragraph 9. Furthermore, it talks about how limited the allowance of testing is. With a large scale rejection of such ideas it is wise to consider the fact that there is not just assumptions made by everyone. The article blatantly puts down the states who did not follow suit in allowing the tests. There was not any consideration of the majority possibly deciding this based on solid fact and the issues not yet addressed by the companies manufacturing the vehicles. So, the legality of the driverless cars is merely one point amongst a plethora of other issues.

One contribution to the rejection of testing is the possible malfunctions that could happen. All throughout the article the accidents in the future were expected. which is why the companies wish for the human assistance to be alert to ""take over"". However, when observing that statement closely the accident would be caused by the car itself due to the fact that it drove in such way. The weather could be an out of control factor involved and if the car does not drive in a way that considers that, then the fault is on the car. The same can be said for a car collision. If all of the vehicles in the world are driven by themselves, then it would be the cars that caused the collision. Paragraph 7 touches on the liability issues of situations similar to those mentioned. The issues surrounding the driverless cars are preventable by not producing them at all. That way there is no room for error when it comes to the safety of those on the road.

The manufacturers of the vehicle contradict themselves when it comes to the passengers involved. Paragraph 8 discusses making the driving fun by entertaining them. Whereas Paragraph 7 is about the driver taking over and the different functions to make them aware. The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Plus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place. Eliminate the possibilty of that irresponsible lack of attention by having the person drive to begin with.

Driverless cars would allow too many flaws in the system and legality issues that prevent them for obtaining the title of a safter option. The manufacturers are attempting to make a car that is easier and requires less effort, but in doing so there is a plethora of issues that accompany it. The question of who is legally to blame for issues would waste time and money. During the process of development, the producers are accepting accidents as a given fact instead of trying to produce a flawless car. They are also focusing on the idea of a ""entertaining car"" instead of one that keeps the passengers alert for possible accidents. Therefore, there are too many arguments for safety against the vehicles to even consider mass producing them. The driverless cars are much safer on the big screen than in reality.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

4a3a4a4,"I have an opinion that I know others will agree with extremely. By popular vote, we should change the election process to The People voting directly. According to my knowledge, the Electoral College isn't fair to voters. I know that many people such as, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFC-CIO agree with me on this. For instance, in the second passage on the first paragraph, it says that and much more. ""They're not alone [Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter...]; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Suggesting by what this satement says, a lot of people disagree with our system of election. We should be able to vote directly ourselves and not have electors do it for us. How do we know we can trust them? Yes, they're a part of our government, but that doesn't mean a thing.

The Electoral College was originally founded to be exactly what it is today; a vote that is held in Congress that is made by popular vote by citizens. But it has changed more than you think.  In article one in the 6th paragraph, it tells exactly how the Electoral College is run. ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This paragraph is saying that the person you vote for is basically supposed to be voted for by his electors. In the second  article, what the author is saying is that even though this certain person will get popular vote, they won't agree with it and they'll go against the votors decisions. This isn't the right thing, obviously. I'm sure that no one knows for a fact that's true though. Even though, this is still a messed up way to vote. This country is about freedom and the right to do what we'd like, as long as it's rational. This is not rational. We need to be able to vote independentley.

There are many things wrong with this aspect of our government. Even though people don't think much of it, we're being treated unfairly. In the second article, in paragraph 2, Plumer (the author) makes a very good point. ""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This makes us realize that we don't know who, for a fact, the electors are. It also shows that we don't know who the electors will vote for. Usually, they would probably vote for the person that were made to vote for.

None of us know what goes on in the Electoral College. We don't know if they vote for who we tell them to vote for. We don't know if they practically cheat us from getting the president we want. In article one, paragraph 8, there is something that the governor does that maybe is supposed to reassure us. ""After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Cerificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.""  This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it's also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want. As I have said through this whole letter, we deserve to directly vote for our President. This isn't fair to us or the person we want elected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

4aa9f4e,"If you could, would you want to live on a different planet? Well according to the author, studying a different planet such as Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports his or her idea well and has many examples to back himself up. The author talks about the similarites Venus has to Earth, the dangers of Venus, and what scientists are doing to make going to Venus a possibility.

Despite the dangers of studing Venus, there are many reasons why it is a worthy pursuit. The author states in the article,""Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This shows that even though Venus is dangerous, there are similarites that make it worth while to study, if that means one day having another planet similar to Earth.

In the article, there are many dangers of Venus. According to the text, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" This shows the challenges of studying Venus because the percent of carbon dioxide and high corrosive sulfuric acid are too much for humans or even some spacecrafts. Another danger is the temperature. Venus averages a surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. That is beyond temperatures at which we humans can withstand. To show the severity of the atmospheric pressure, the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" These dangers may seem like it isn't a worthy pursuit but the author goes on to describe just why and how scientist should pursue Venus. The article states that long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. To add on to that, today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. This is a good example to support that the author supports his or her claim because it is describing what was and is still good about Venus. The top example that supports the authors claim is what the scientists have already done to begin the search of Venus. According to the article, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" This supports the author's claim because despite the dangers of Venus, the scientists have found a way to study Venus at a more suitable, safer way. Maybe not as efficient, but it saves the lives of the astronaunts.

In conclusion, the author supports his or her claim well because of all the evidence and examples that are used in the text. Stating the similarites of Earth show that it is worth while to study Venus when the outcome could possibly be a planet that is like a second Earth. Describing the dangers of Venus but then talking about how the scientists can get around those dangers supports the author's claim because the readers see that even though Venus is dangerous, there are still valuable ways to study it, meaning that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

4b8a067,"Are you someone who is really good at hiding your feelings or emotions? or are you someone who is expressing everything that you feel inside and emotions?. More importantly, are you someone who likes to express your feelings but is not good at expressing it?. I am someone who is really good at hiding my feelings and someone who is not good at expressing feelings. I smile when I am sad and I cry when I am happy. The technology won't be able read my emotion when I can't even express myself. Therefore, the use of technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable because it cannot read your mind, it cannot see or feel your feelings and it will cost a lot of money.

First of all, I don't expect the computer to read my mind because it's imposible. It may read your outside

such as your appearance, body, or your outside emotions but it can't read what you are thinking inside.The article said, ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". I disagree with the quote above because you never know if she is pretending to be happy, surprised, sad or joyful. When you think about it, the only person that knows how you feel and how you think is you, the technology cannot define it. Let's say you are laughing in your mind and you don't show it outside, will the computer see your emotions?. Therefore, the use of this techology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable or inffective.

Furthermore, this technology cannot see or feel what you are feeling inside. The article said, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". The quote is basically saying this technology can see your emotions but I don't agree with it. Some students could be hiding their emotions or feelings. for example, one student is hurt and deeply sad inside but is pretending to be fine and smiling, will it know what she is feeling inside?. It will only see the fake emotions, the outer appearance and that is why the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable.

In addition, this technology is considered a high technology so it will cost a lot of money to own it. Some schools might not have enough money to purchase it. If this technology could do those things, most of all the schools might want it and if they can't purchase it, it is sad for them. Plus, this technology is not useful so why spend a lot of money on it. There are a lot of ways the schools could use the money such as donating so why spend money on technology that is not useful. It is not worth spending the money for, that is why the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable.

In conlusion, the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable because it cannot read your mind, it cannot see or feel what you are feeling inside, and because it costs a lot of money. It may see what you show but it cannot see what you actually feels inside unless you express it. If you are someone who is not good at expressing your emotions or feelings, this technology is not for you and is not valuable.    ",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

4c822ee,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" I do not think the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit very well. He also supports it a little and instead focuses on the dangers of the planet. Some of the dangers he says is that no spacecraft has even lasted a few hours on Venus, and that tempratures are around 800 degrees. The planet has to harsh of an atmosphere for us to visit.

The author almost seems like he should be supporting not going to Venus. In the third paragraph he talks about how deadly of an enviroment it is. He says that the atmosphere is made of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and that the clouds are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. These things alone would make it nearly impossible for any type of life to exist, so why explore a place where its imposible for anything to have ever lived there. With 97 percent carbon dioxide it could have been a possibility for plant life, but he then adds that on the surface it is over 800 degrees Fahenheit. With that kind of heat its impossible to survive.

To make things worse the author is not just talking about an unmaned spacecraft visit, he is talking about humans visiting it. With the atmospheric pressure around 90 times greater than Earth, we would die before we even reached the surface. Even if you were to get to the surface the there are still many obsticals to overcome. Life for example volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and lightning strikes.

One of the only times the author supports his idea is in paragraph 4. The author says ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" While that may sound interesting that is a huge probably. They are basing this off the fact that Venus has some of the same features of Earth like valleys and mountains. That is to big of a risk to take because it could cost millions of dollars and even a life if we sent a human there.

In paragraph 5 the author talks about ideas that could be used to send humans there like a blimp. To me that just sounds to risky because you can do all the testing you want but it only takes one small mistake for everything to go south. The value of Venus that he talks about is insight gained and because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The values he talks about here are simply not enough. The risks by far outweights the rewards.

That was why to me the author did not support his idea well enouth. To me he gave more dangers that he did rewards. Plus risking a human life is not to be taken lightly, you need to be 100% certain that they will survive. With tempratures above 800 degrees and an atmospheric preassure 90 times greater than Earth I don't see how anyone could survive. Even when a drone does not survive how is a human supposed to? That is why the author did not support the idea well enough. ",5,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

4ceefe6,"Does anyone remeber when Google came up with the smart glasses that can do anything? It was said to be the next revolutionary smart item and everyone will either want it, or have it. Well, as it turns out, not even half of America bought these state-of-the-art glasses. Just as the Google glasses did not succeed, I believe the same thing will happen to driveless cars. Not only will they be extremely expensive to manufacture and buy, but they are also completely unecessary. There are already smart phones that can read fingerprints and buy anything just with a press of a button--correction: the press of a screen. Also, the cars can even possibly be labeled as unsafe. Anyone could go anywhere because there is no specific driver; nobody is in control. Children could drive off to anywhere they pleased if they felt like doing so. Also, as stated in the passage, who will pay for damages and possible hospital bills if there are accidents? It couldn't be the driver's fault, because they weren't even controlling the car. It couldn't be the manufacturers fault, because the car worked perfectly for testing, right? Driveless cars may be fascinating, but they are not a good idea for an improved way of driving.

First of all, these vehicles will be extremely expensive. The United States is already trillions of dollars in debt due to many wars and payments, and yet we still keep spending billions of dollars that we do not have. Not only will the cars cost a lot of money to make, but having to remake every single road so that these smart cars can drive on them will cost even more. The amount of construction workers that would have to be paid would shoot numbers through the roof! Exactly how much would these cars even cost? Guaranteed, the cost of buying these cars will not be equivalent to the average Toyota Camry or Honda Civic. The car may use half the fuel needed for regular cars, but they will cost a lot more than gas.

Secondly, these cars are not necessary. They are new! They are exciting! They are the most ridiculous idea to have been considered. So many machines do the work for people and this can result in a fat America. The United States has already been depicted as the most unhealthy country. If these cars can drive themselves, anyone could go anywhere without a driver. If this is correct, then it is possible for a child to possibly drive to the next state if they felt like it. Criminals wouldn't need a getwaway driver if all they had to do is hop in the car and press a button. This is an unsafe possibility. Although the driverless car may seem fun for people who want a new way to be transported, it is completely unecessary and lazy.

Finally, the idea of driverless cars may contradict with the law. As stated in the article, there may be some conflict between manufacturers and consumers when it comes to accidents and road problems. If there was an accident between two smart cars, who would pay for the damage? It is difficult to point fingers when both cars are driverless and are not controlled by a person. Will the manufacturers have a warranty for the car? Will each driver have to pay for damages themselves as if they just broke a cell phone? Does a separate insurance come with the car? These are questions that need to be answered if manufactureres want their ideas to sell.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea because they cost money that is not there, they are unecessary and may even be dubbed as unsafe, and the idea contradicts with many laws in different states. Just as the Google glasses was a bit too much, the driverless cars would meet the same unfortunate fate.",5,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

4d6ac79,"Dear Senator,

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The system has been around for milleniums from our founding fathers and the Constitution in the 1700s to present day America, it is critical that we update our system to a more realistic process where the citizens have more say in the leader we choose to lead us. I am in favor in abolishing the Electoral College becasue most of the power should be held in the hand of the citizens and the popular vote should have more regards than the vote in Congress. I am not in favor in keeping the Electoral College because under the college system, voters don't vote for the president but for a slate elector, who in turn ""elect the president"", the process is unfair to voters, and over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election rather than the kind we have now.

When people go out of thier way to vote, they vote because they want to have a say in their potentially future. They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction. They would like to think that one vote could make a difference in a election, but with the Electoral College voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than vote who they actulally want to be president. Under the Electoral College voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. In reality the people are not voting for the president they are putting their trust in somebody they vote to vote for the person they have choose to lead. Democrats in Texas for example knowing their vote will have no effect in the election they become less interested in the campaign than they would if the president was choosen diectly by popular votes and that is unfair to the people.

The process is unfair to the people because of the ""winner takes all"" system in each state the canidates dont take time in states in which they know have no chances of gaining them any power, they stay in states that are more benefically to them. The canidates mostly focus on the tight races ocuring in the ""swing states"" in 2000 many states didnt even get to see the candiates because they were ""little, irrlevent, and worthless"" states. I'm sure many people in those sates such as South Carolina and Rhode Island had a lot of input to add in the 2000 campagin but because they were little minority states they werent focused on as much as the other larger staes. This is very unfair and judgementally to these states because the Electoral College is based on involuntary effects, the inhabitants of North Caiolina or Rhode Island cannot control where they choose to live, they might have to live in the certain geograpic location because of finaces or religous persecution. They may want to have a say in the election but cant because of their living arrangements.

Many might contradict that the Electoral College is benefical because it has more of a certain outcome but with that certainty comes many votes and state votes that were disregarded. The Electoral College is unfair in many different aspects we need to update our system of election, becasue like everything else in the world has an expiration date. Their is an expiration date on almost all of our food and beverages, an expiration date on salvery, an expiration date on our life, and so now we need an expiration date on the Electoral College.

4d6bbea,"Teaching in a classroom setting is something that has been happening sucessfully for centuries now, dating way way back before technology was even being thought about. This goes to show technolgoy is not needed, but maybe sonetimes helpful. In a classroom setting peices of technology such has things like computers can be super helpful when doing things such as writing an essay, and acessing information online, however when taken too advancely it can become more of a joke, and a distraction to students. That's where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The Facial Action Coding System theoretically seems to be a good idea but in reality it's an expensive toy. There are many other proven effective ways to teach in a classroom, and somethings are boring to learn about but you still have to know them, so just sit still, relax, and learn.

The first thing you notice when walking into a classroom is usually the students who are choosing not to spend their time wisely rather than the students who are. This is because students who choose be off task are often distracted by technolgy and gaming which is a lot more noticable to the human eye. These students are taking advantage of technology provided and using it for bad. So why would we put the Facial Action Coding System in schools when it is expensive and would be used as a toy? That's right, we wouldnt. When used for other purposes we also risk crashing which is another thing that would take up more time rather than taking that time for the students to be taught.

Everybody learns in differnt ways for example take the idea of studying for a spelling test. Some kids learn by writing it down multiple times, some kids learn by hearing it being spelled, others learn best by repeating it. There are so many way for kids to learn so by adding the Facial Action Coding System into schools you're assessing kids on how much they enjoy what they are learning about, and not how much information they are actually gaining. Which bring me to my next point.

Not every kid is going to be excited about everything they learn. Yes, some books are boring, and who wants to learn about what cells are made of, and who cares who invented the lightbulb, but these are all things kids are going to learn anyways. Not everything is going to be fun. sometimes you just need the facts. Making kids excited about a topic all comes from the influences of other people being excited about a topic and feeling that positive energy around them. If a computer screen told you you were bored, it wouldn't make you less bored.

The Facial Action Coding System is not all bad. There are some good parts about it. In the pasage the author talks about how ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" To recognize when a student is confused is a powerful thing, because when more students are confused they don't always like to say it, however the Facial Action Coding System is an expesive way to tell if a student is confused. If a child is confused they should say something. This allows students to build up self-confidence. All in all the Facial Action Coding System has both pros and cons, however the cons over power the pros making this tool not valuable in a classroom setting. It is an expensive toy that should be used for other purposes. Not to say there is no good uses for the Facial Action Coding System, but it is just not valueable in a classroom setting.

The

Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.

Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people . Also, the electoral college causes many issues duing the voting period.

To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year.

You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford Plumer states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Plumer Paragraph 10) What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose

HILARY CLINTON!

Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.

If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people.

Furthermore, the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system ae wrong"" Bradford explains ""Back in 1960, Segregationists in the Louisinna legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.

The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote.

Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time,

People would be let down when they find out that  the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.

Bradford proves this by explaining ""...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Plumer Paragraph 11) On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Richard A. Posner exclaims ""The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner Paragraph 15) What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.

Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.

On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example,

The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the ""Winner-take-all"" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.

However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.

There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons

NOT

to keep the electoral college in use.

Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they  might have as their new president.

According to Bradford, the electoral college is ""...Unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer paragraph 14) It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.    ",6,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

06e2db4,"For years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the ""heart"", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students.

When eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, ""Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk.

The first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the ""your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger""(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'""(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students.

As more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a ""I do not want to be here"" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students.

Although this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom.

07d41ed,"The use of the Facial Action Conding System would be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom because it will detect how the student feels about the task at hand. If it detects that the student is bored it could modify the lesson to make them more awake and begin working on the task at hand. This technology could also help find each students way of learning. For example if one student works hands on and another works by taking notes then the system can mofify both programs to fit their learning style. This technology also could help teachers see if a student understands a topic, and if they see they don't or they are becoming frustrated with it they can modify the lesson. Using this system would be of value to students and schools, because it not only would help students learn but it would also help teacher teach.

If a student is feeling bored with his or her work the Facial Ation Coding System can modify the task at hand and make the student more prone to continue and finish the work. This claim is supported by the article because it says ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" This would help the teacher help the student make changes. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This technology not only helps students become more inclined in school work but it also helps teachers

This technology could help find each students way of learning by detecting each facial expression to see if they are inclined in the task at hand. For example, if one student is understanding and enjoying the way a lesson is being taught, the system could modify each of their lessons to fit their way of learning. But if another student doesn't like the way a lesson is being taught the system can test out different styles until the correct one is found. The article supports this by stating ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar as might follow."" This example could go for both advertisment and school work. ""If you frown, the next ad will be different."" This system can be used to see if a student is enjoying and understanding a lesson as well as not enjoying and understanding a lesson.

The Facial Action Coding System could help teachers see if a student is understanding a topic or lesson. It could do this by detecting their facial expression then letting the teacher know if changes need to be made. This would help because it allows the teacher to know if thier methods of teaching are acually being of value to the student. This claim is supported because the article includes ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This supports the claim because it shows that the software can identify not only one emotion but serveral. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The technology can analize and detect certain emotions and allow the teacher to see all of them and make modifcations if they are needed.

Using this system would be a value to schools because it not only helps students learn but it would help teachers teach. It would allow teachers to see how certain kids learn and modify their lessons to fit. It would also allow students to be more inclined in the task at hand. This system would be a great value to education and how kis are taught.         ",6,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

Although plausible, the creations would be impractical and would not produce ensured results. The author's support for the idea of exploring Venus is mediocre at best.

Being the second-closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration. With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a ""blimp"" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money.

An additional idea that was brought up by the author was ""Silicon electronics."" Siliscon electronics would be resistent to the harsh conditions on the planet-- for a while. The systems would run for about a month before total failure. these silicon systems are very expensive to bein with and are still in the development phase here on earth. Creating enough silicon circuits to power a rover or vehicle would take years to manufacture. And by the point of satisfactory innovation for silicon electronics, a new product may have been presented.

Lastly, a ""cave-man"" idea of mechanical computers came into play. These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all. Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices. When made out of an acid-resistent substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work. The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth. There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research.

The author of this article is trying to push a principle that is not fully developed yet. The reasons that were provided may work after many years of design and development, but right now, none are practical. A combination of the three presented ideas may actually work the best. Use a blimp to float above the planet, tie a cable to the blimp that connects is with machanical machinery, and use silicon electronics to transmit the findings. Damage could be repaired by raising the equipment back up to the blimp. Innovation does not come easy for those who are in charge of it, but ideas like this are needed in providing an answer for a difficult question.

Overall, the author's arguments do not satisfy the overall risk and reward stakes. After more time passes, maybe he will write another article depicting what will work for sure. The support was not presented in a way that was convincing enough to dive right in to this new frontier of space.  ",6,3.0,3.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 3

0a9488d,"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 ""Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency.""  If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that """"faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these ""faithless"" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a one-sided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country (population wise), they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well.    ",6,4.0,4.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

0aae146,"The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.

To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?

Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" (21). While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced.

In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.                              ",6,4.0,4.0,,":

0d2070c,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is speculated to have been the most similar to Earth, studying it can be done at reasonable expectations, and combatting the difficulty of studying Venus will have great benefits to our knowledge on the planet itself and space exploration.

It has long been a conspiracy yet to be proven as to if Venus is one of our known sister planets that are the most similar to Earth today. Space explorers long ago predicted that Venus was likely covered with large oceans and had the potential to possibly support multiple forms of life. Without an indepth study of Venus at a close and personal view, nothing can be predetermed factually. In paragraph four the author explains that ""it [Venus] may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This shows that the possibility is there but without extra measures taken to pursue an indepth study, the question remains unanswered as to if Venus is a sister planet of Earth.

While an upclose, indepth view of Venus is not predictable due to the harsh environment, NASA has found potential ways to make exploration dueable to an extent. In paragraph five, the author states that: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This helps widen the idea that exploration of Venus can be done and met at a reasonable expectation and limit safe for explorers. The author proceeds to state that while the conditions are not particularly easy they are ""survivable for humans."" This helps detail and push for the idea of the exploration of Venus because it is and has been discovered that the study can be done safely.

The overall study of Venus can prove to be extremely beneficial to our knowledge on the planet alone, and our knowledge on space exploration at most. In paragraph eight, it is stated that ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value."" In which it does, combatting the challenge of Venus proves to be tough, but if done, it can mean more to the exploration of other planets that are tougher than Venus alone. Further in paragraph eight, it is said that ""travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Once we begin to limit our exploration and discoveries due to the dangers and doubts, we take away from our progression of knowing what is out of our way. With the study of Venus we can extend our doings to meet every innovation and curiosity about our solar system all together.

Studying Venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it presents. With the study of Venus we can determine if Venus is a sister planet of our planet today, and if the planet was once inhabitable for organisms and humans. Studying Venus is also worth the pursuit because the study can be done, and if the study is done, it will benefit us far more than the study of any other planet has yet to. The study of Venus will bring our knowledge and our future immense benefits in all aspects.    ",6,4.0,,,":**

0dcf2f6,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives the reader basic insight on what Venus is, its history, why scientists are trying to explore it, and the challenges scientists have faced.

Overall it is a very informative article and the point of it was to convince the reader that despite all of the struggles there is that comes with exploring Venus, that it is worth exploring anyway.

Though it is an admirable arguement, it is simply not supported throughout this type of article.

In the article, the author does not support his or her argument well because of his or her informative over-kill, lack of analysis, and lack of data in his or her favor.

To begin, the author gives us too many facts that are simply just an introduction. In paragraph three, the whole paragraph is stating facts about Venus and its atmosphere.

For example the author states that, ""...atmospheric pressure is 90 times great than what we experience on our own planet.""

This does resonate with the arguement considering that it is about how Venus should be explored despite the challenges.

The real problem with this example is that this is placed in the third paragraph and everything before it was also facts.

The author spent three paragraphs talking about the weather of Venus instead of analyzing how it should be disregared and we should explore it for better reasons. Additionally, the author gives facts that have nothing to do with the arguement provided.

In the second paragraph, the author states that, ""...sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.""

This simply has nothing to do with the supposed topic.

Not only is there too many facts, but these facts have nothing to do with the topic and the author seems to -in fact- trail off a bit.

Multiple times.

Additionally, the author seems to provide no analysis towards the plethera of information.

For example, the first true analysis is seen is in paragraph five when he or she states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

By the time someone is writing to paragraph five, there should already be an extreme of amount of noticable analysis before that.

The basic structure of any arguement would be to state a fact, and give a well thought-out analysis about that fact and how it applies to one's topic.

The noticable structure here, would be an overwhelming amount of facts, and then slight analysis by assuming that the evidence speaks for itself.

When you have that much information thrown at the reader at once, the evidence really doesn't speak for itself.

That's where the supposed analysis comes in.

The analysis is supposed to connect the dots for the reader and explain how it applies.

It seems that is lacking here.

Finally, the author seems to be arguing against themselves with the type of evidence that is being presented.

Throughout the whole article the author seems to be only stating the things wrong with this idea.

For example in paragraph two, the author states that, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for than a few hours.""

Then backed that up with no analysis on how that should be worth the risk so scientists can can continue exploring.

This is a problem because that is the point of the article: that despite all the risks, scientists should perservere. That's is not what followed that unsettling fact, though.

All that followed was more facts.

Additionally in paragraph six, the author finally states a good fact on how exploration can continue, but then follow it with analysis that once again goes against the arguement.

For example, after talking about the solution NASA has made to this problem, the author follow it with, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide limited insight...""

This was a poor choice of support because the author is basically going against his or her idea, without reconciling it.

In conclusion, the author makes it unclear which side he or she is trying to prove.

It is a very well-written article, but only for informational purposes.

If one it looking for a well-supported idea on how despite all the risks, science should continue, this article is not the place to look.

If anything, it seems that the author is arguing against continuing to explore Venus-considering all the facts and analysis that went against the idea.

Once again, this is a well written informative article, not an arguable one.",6,3.0,3.0,,":

0f789a2,"There are many controversial ideas about what was seen in the picture on Cydonia. Some belive it was from alien life form some do not. I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens. I say this because we have pictures proving so, landforms are known to form in odd ways, and we have double checked and there were no signs of alien life forms.

The ""Face"" was not created by aliens because we have pictures proving so. In the article ""Unmasking The Face Of Mars"" they said that when they first saw a picture of this mysterious face is was the year 1976. A lot of changes were being made that year, it was the peak of technology for Americans and we were bound to go on in our experiments. it states in the article that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photo."" And in return it was a natural landform. But people were still not satisfied. They claimed that the picture was taken at a cloudy time of year for the Red Planet so they tried again as stated in the passage, "" Nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"" and the results were as followed, "" Marlins team captured an extroardinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution"" the results still came back as a lanform.

I do not believe that the "" Face "" was created by aliens because landfroms are known to form in odd ways. For example in the article it states that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the american west."" They claimed this after taking the picture April 8, 2001. The picture simply shows ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" as said in the article. How many times when we were all children did we think we saw someone when it was just a shadow? plenty of times and in this instance it is exactly the same.

And lastly I do not believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was created by alien life form because we have double checked and checked again and we did not find signs of any form of life on Mars. It said in the article that they took a picture in 1976, then they were astonished so they checked again in 1998, and then when people were still not satisfied they checked agin in 2001. It sates in the article that ""Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""

and not only that but, "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" this goes to show that there were no life forms ever there and that the face is simply landforms and shadows and that aliens did not have anything to do with this sittuation at all.

However though, it states in the article that "" The face of Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkou tlines for 25 years! some people think that the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars"" It is not uncommon or odd that peopkle would want to belive that there is another life forms besides what we already know, some would go as far to say that "" evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" as stated in the article. But the most shocking thing is when it says that "" defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" I don't see why anybody working with NASA would ever doubt the system if they are a aprt of it, but then again NASA most likely does not just give out important information to everybody who steps foot into there office claiming to work there. And it wouldn't surprise me actually if the budget defenders of NASA did wish that there was actualy life forms because NASA is having to dump more and more money because people like the ""conspiracy theorists"" can't just have faith and believe what NASA tells them even though they had evidence to back them up.

To all of this is still say that I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens . I say this because we have pictures and images proving so, landforms are know to grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and because we have double checked and checked and there were no signs of alien life or any form of life at all up on Mars. I think that the information that i have presented you with would go to show and prove my theory right. ",6,3.0,3.0,,":

1013fcd,"The Facial Action Coding System is an unnecesscary piece of equipment. The software that would be able to detect the emotions of an individual would have several negative affects on society. The reading of emotions is a useful tool when it is detected by someone's natural instinct, but it would not be helpful to only have an understanding on someone's emotions due to the results given on a screen. The Facial Action Coding System is not a valuable to students because it would decrease the rate at which students learn, identifying someone's emotions will not change how they are feeling, and it would decrease their motivation for work in the future.

The ability for this device to detect the emotions of a student while they are working would be detrimental to the health and responsibilty of the student. The author states that the machines will ""recognize when the student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective intructor"" (D'Alto 6). This would be harmful to the students determination to learn. It would also cause several students to fall behind in their education. Every student experiences boredom in class, but the teacher is unable to change the lesson everytime to best fit one individual student because the other children will fall behind. Students are still capable of learning material when they are bored even if it is not as effectively as when they are interested. Students need to also learn how to work through their emotions to better their ability to improve. When these students get into the work field, they can not call in sick or slack off every time they experience a negative emotion. This device would be teaching children that they should only be productive if they are intrigued by their task. This would not be a proper lesson to teach growing individiuals.

The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels. Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful.

The technology that recognizes emotions in order to change the student potential will decrease their motivation. The skill to be compable of working through tough situations is essential to posess. Modifying a students' workload would harm their motivation. These students will no longer be motivation to be their most effective because they will expect everything in life to be modified to their liking. Unfortunately, this is not a trait that can be successfully transferred to real world issues. Therefore, these students will be less prepared for potential problems they may encounter. This system would also decrease the dependence on human connection. The text states that computers need to understand emotional communications because ""most human connection is nonverbal"" (D'Alto 6). Although that statement is true, there is little use for computers undertsanding how humans feel if they can not help the individual with their emotons. This may cause people to reply more on the machines, which would lessen the amount of human connection that exists--much like previous technology advances have done. Human connection is essential to a striving population, therefore it will have negative affect on society.

The Facial Action Coding Sytem would be wasteful to the society, and would cause several negative effects. It is not something worth investing in because it would harm the developing youth. Not only do these machines prove useless to emotions of people, but it will also decrease the motivation of students and future employees.",6,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

14174ed,"Facial recognition, a thing of the future, at least that's what people thought. With the new age of innovative technology, a special field of new technology has come to the public, facial recognition software. One of the most prominent softwares in the facial recognition field is the FACS, or facial action coding system, which is what was used to figure out exactly what emotion Mona Lisa was feeling in her painting. However, this software could be used in many other fields. The ability to read and detect what emotion some are feeling is very powerful and could be implimented into certain areas such as the classroom. The usage of FACS could be very beneficial to schools for reading students emtions so teachers could see how their learning plan affects the students, organize and figure out which subjects students may enjoy more, and also allow schools to see what areas of the school may need to be improved on the most.

By using facial recognition, teachers would be ablel to read the expressions on students' faces and see what their learning plan make the students feel. A prime example of how this could be used in the classroom would be in paragraph four, where the author states "" 'The facial expressions for each emotion are are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements."" This specific example is important because by using this software, the facial movements of every student could be tracked, without worry of missing something, and could therefore help teachers distinguish how all their students feel about their lesson plan. Along with that, in paragraph six the author states something similar to this main point ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is exactly what the point is, the computer could tell what needed to be changed and why.

Along with seeing how the teacher's plan affects the students, FACS could also potentially allow students to be organized and grouped up by what subject they appear to enjoy the most. Computers and computer programs are used most often for the usage and organiztion of data, that is what defines computer code, sets of data being used in certain ways. Well, the same type of usage could be had in a classrooom for organizing which subject students liked more. In paragraph five the author writes ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specfic emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical informatino as electronic code."" This points out that code already stores the data that it takes in and knows how to use it. That takes out a step in the process of using it in the class. By having it store data, the computer could then organize it into sections based on what students appeared more happy in certain classes and help with finding interests. Also, in paraghraph four the author states ""By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This is especially important due to the fact that sometimes students can feel mixed about the class they are in, which means the computer can help figure out how they may feel truly about the subject.

Above the learning aspect, schools could see where students physically feel the best or worst in the school or class. While the majority of use would be for the learning portion of the class, FACS could also be used quite often to help discern what physical things may need to change in the school. Maybe a student in a poor chair shows discomfort and the school learns it needs better chairs. In paragraph five, the author writes ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" While this is true, many people are able to easily figure out what a face may mean, the computer would have an even easier time doing it with lighting quick judgement and fast calculations to back it up. The usage of these quick calculations could be beneficial and allow the school to have a better input system and see exactly how the school feels, rather than relying on teahcers to figure out how the students may feel. Another good example of how the FACS could help improve school's physical aspects would be in paragraph six where the author uses and example of improvement themself by stating ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This example shows very well how the computer recognition could really tend to one's needs and how one feels, therefore helping improve the quality of the school.

Overall, facial recognition software is a very promising and prominent idea for the future of classrooms. The computer's ability to see how the learning plan affects the students and change the plan based on the response to the FACS being able to organize and find which subject the students like more in their school is extremely crucial to the new innovative learning process. Also by helping improve the overall quality of the school, the software is something that certain schools should look into. Hopefully this idea of facial recognition software in schools can become a reality and eventually become a nationally recognized function to aid in the learning process. Once an idea of the future brought into the modern day, the Facial Action Coding System truly has an eye for all things emotion.",6,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

16395a4,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has 44 major muscles in the human face programmed and their movements detectable by its software. While some may not understandable the use of this technology, it would be groundbreaking and highly effective within our classrooms. Many humans portray false or pretend emotions to other humans for various, different reasonings. However, the FACS could be used to break through this method of manipulation and deception by tracking the facial muscles being used and moved by its subject. It would allow the computer to calculate the different emotions and feelings being present in its subject, which could be used in a matter of many different ways.

Within the classroom, various emotions can be felt by its students while learning new topics and receiving their education. Feelings can range from excitement and an interest in learning new subjects to being bored or unmotivated to proceed with the lesson. Day by day, technology is further and used more frequently within our schools, allowing us to adapt new education methods. Most students in the US are presented with an electronic device by their school to complete their homework and classwork on. The FACS could easily be intregrated into these devices, affecting how education could be taught and learned. If it was being used in a correct, effective manner, it could change how we teach our students forever!

Let's imagine that a student was perhaps puzzled and confused by a lesson being taught using technology. The FACS program could detect this, modifying the information to be more understandable and/or enjoyable to the student. This would allow for education to be more effective in many different ways. It could be very different for how two tenth graders in the same class learn new subjects and topics the most effectively. If this was released into schools, it is very possible and most likely that grades would improve drastically. This technology could also assist those with special needs or learning disabilities to teach them in the most effective, best technique for them.

While being present at school, not all emotions displayed by students are caused by learning. There might be unknown stresses or difficulties at home or personal lives, causing emotional and/or physical distress. This can majorly affect their grades and learning experience, but also their overall health in general. Using the FACS to detect certain emotions and patterns in students could help notify educators and administration of possible issues with various causes. This would allow the student to gain access to the aid and assist they need to be able to persevere and stride forward with success. The health of students need to come first before learning and using technology to discover if they need assistance would invaluable to the school systems.

Technology is always advancing and evolving into different, new forms. The FACS is just one of the many things that could change our education system and how we teach students. Overall, it would provide aid to students that need it to succeed in their education and have more of a understanding in subjects they were originally confused by. A major benefit to using this program would be detecting distress in students, allowing the school to assist them and receive the help they need to succeed.

1ac7f5b,"In Nick D'Alto's article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, the value for technology is absurd, because in certain situations everyone should not be exposed to the emotions of others. For example, emotions are extremely personal and sometimes it is not technically appropriate to showcase every emotion you are feeling. A student or teacher could be going through something personal, that needs to be left out of the workplace and school. Success at school or work in general depends on how you engage in those specific tasks at hand, so the emotions the computer is claiming you are having should not interfere with specific things outside of your personal life. Detecting emotions should be left out of serious, and professional environments such as work or school. Lastly, the computer is only trained to detect the movement of the muscles in your face. But your face may not always match the feeling of emotion inside, so this may not be the most appropriate device to truly rely on.

The importance of keeping emotions personal, and not oversharing with people around you is extremely important. Most students are usually adolescents and they sometimes have a hard time expressing and controlling their emotions. So having a device eager to showcase their feelings can be dangerous and insensitive. Eckman has already begun to classify specific emotions including; ""anger, fear, disgust, and sadness,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 3). The negative emotions should not be shared! A computer should not illustrate how you are feeling on the inside to others. This can awaken a lot of frustrated, and haphazard behavior among teens if something is constantly around proclaimming it understands how everyone is feeling. D'Alto also states, ""associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" (Paragraph 3). The muscles in the face should not be studied by a computer, and they should not be able to invade the privacy of the muscle movement in someones face. Also, some may argue that their face does not always match what they are feeling, so that leaves alot of room for confusion, and flaws on the systems part. It's untraditional, and orthodox, and an invasion of mental privacy.

Everyone is different, whether life is amazing or terrible, someone should not be able to be read or determine how you are feeling by what a computer says about their face. Some teachers or students could be dealing some serious, and personal things that should not find their way into the workplace or school. But, if this device is constantly procclaiming a student or teacher is sad or upset about something personal it is completely unneccessary. Students should not know the personal lives of their teachers or vise versa. This is an ambigous invasion of privacy, and could potentially even amount to a crime or disservice to some people. D'Alto questions the reader, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" (D'Alto, Paragraph 6). This only has limited benefits and could cause immense problems in relation to others knowing personal things relating to your emotions. The specific boundaries it crosses especially if you are not well acquainted with the people constantly around you is alarming. D'Alto claims again, ""Can your lab partner recognize which one?"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 7). There should be absolutely no valid reason, why someone you may not know should be able to, and have the capacity to read your emotions from looking at you. In schools, sometimes in relation to this specific example, students are not acquainted with their lab partners or the people around them. So this would be like giving a stranger a clear look, and picture into another persons mind! It would be like being allowed to read the mind of others around you. This specific example is horrible in attempt to promote their product, and scares the consumers with the thought of others starring into their souls.

Technology has never been a reliable thing, it has never lived up to its name and full potential when people truly want it to. The thought of a computer having this amount of control is excessive, and unrealistic. In Paragraph 7, D'Alto states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 7). If our PC's cannot handle the Mona Lisa, how will they have the capacity to decode our real life, actively changing faces? Can the creators of this system not see their flaws? D'Alto continues to suggest, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code."" (D'Alto, Paragraph 5). This passage is inferring to the reader that the only logical way a computer can read information is through and electrical code. Humans do not produce emotions through an electrical code, so it is not logical to expect their emotions to be read to through an emotional code.

All in all, the idea was ambitious, but it defintely was not original or rationally thought out. The thought of a computer reading into personal emotions, attempting to decode issues that are too personal to be brought into school and work, and essentially incorrectly interpret emotions is absurd. This whole idea invades the privacy of the people in society, and is a very touchy subject that should not be programmed into a computer.      ",6,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

1b45c61,"Our facial expressions can tell someone a lot about how we feel about something or situations in our lives, sometimes even better than verbal communication. Being able to read these expressions and change the environment around us could help the human race acheive the goal of becoming monumentally more happy people. Throughout the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author mentions many studies and facts relating to the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions. This would be very useful in the classroom because the studies shown have very intelligent figures present, the article includes a thourough explanation about how the FACS operates and succeeds, and how the technology could improve the willingness to learn and the ultimate goal of maintaining happiness.

First of all, in paragraph 6, the diction in the paragraph and the implementation of an interview with an intelligent figure relating to the product prove that this machine could make a vital difference in a classroom-style learning environment. For exmaple, author Nick D'Alto interviews Dr. and Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang works with other professors such as Nicu Sebe on the FACS, and in this pragraph he states many important facts about how computers could alter the learning environment based on how the student feels. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

Being able to modify a lesson for a single student rather than an entire group could make a huge difference. Rather than the teacher having to chage the whole lesson for the entire class, the computer could ""read"" and individual student's face and effectively personalize the lesson for that student alone. This technology could supply a much needed change to the sometimes ineffective teaching of an instructor.

Also, in paragraphs 7 and 8, detailed instructions are given on how the machine works and how it can detect fake emotions from real emotions. For example, at the end of paragraph 7, the author states the difference between the muscle movements in a real and fake smile. He then states how the machine looks for the muscle movements and formations of a real smile rather than those of a fake one. Also, in paragraph 8, even more examples of differences in muscle formation are used to show how the technology will in fact work in a classroom environment. The differences between a fake and real smile may seem like an easy task to distinguish in real life, and it may appear to be a problem for a machine. However, the information written by D'Alto from the interview with Dr. Huang show that the machine will have no problem distinguishing a real, genuine happy smile from a fake, intentionally deceiving grin. Therefore, a student could not effectively trick the machine into changing a lesson in a classroom environment.

Finally, in paragraph 9, a study on facial expressions and their relation to emotions is cited. In this study, many important ideas about feelings carried out by humans are stated with truthfulness and security. For example, the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion states that moving your facial muscles can not only express emotions, but can even help produce them. This states that real emotions can occur from just making a face. Even if the person who was making the expression originally was not feeling that emotion, they may in fact feel that way after one small change in their expression. Also, the author references a ""renowed drama coach,"" Constantin Stanislavsky, who states that he forced his actors to reproduce the actions of smiling and frowning so they genuinely feel happy or sad when on stage. Overall, a change in one small part of your face can change how you feel, and if this technology is implemented into classrooms throughout America, that one small change could alter the way students feel about learning.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as mentioned in Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" could be used in classrooms to successfully ""read"" the faces of students, alter the lesson in some way just for them, and make sure each student is happy with what they are hearing and seeing. If this technology is implemented into classrooms around the globe, students will be more excited about their learning experiences, possibly receive much improved grades, and be more happy people in gerenal. If the faces of the next generation are happier than ever, what's to come afterword could be even better.",6,4.0,4.0,,":

1f2ec63,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" many challenges of studying Venus are presented; however, the author provides many valid reasons as to why researchers should find ways to study this planet. The author describes the similarities of Venus and Earth, provides solutions to living on Venus, and expresses how researching Venus would be an advancement of the human mind.

The author supports their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit despite its dangers, by suggesting that Venus may have once been similar to Earth. The author wrote in paragraph 4, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" By suggesting that Venus could have some answers to Earth's climate, the author provides strong support to their claim. The text also states in paragraph 4, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The author goes on to describe how Earth and Venus may have been closely related long ago. It is also mentioned that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit, which is beneficial considering the how long space travel takes. The author's claim is supported through this evidence of Venus being Earth-like at one point in time.

Another way that the author suppprts their claim is by providing some solutions to studying Venus, despite the dangers it possesses. The author writes in paragraph 5, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" In paragraph 5, the author continues to explain how the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not go over the radiation levels on Earth. The solution that the author suggests helps support their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit by giving direct evidence as to how researchers may go about doing this.

Lastly, the author supports his/her claim by explaining how overcoming the challenge of studying Venus, would be beneficial not only to the insight of the planet, but also of human curiosity. The author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The claim is strongly supported through the author's description of how studying Venus could be beneficial to the human mind. Another detail from paragraph 8 is, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author supports that studying Venus would be worth overcoming the harsh conditions, as it would expand our views of imagination and innovation.

Despite all of the author's reasons for studying Venus, he/she describes how Venus has harsh conditions that must be overcome first. The text states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The author expresses how Venus's conditions are far more extreme than any conditions on Earth. However, the author supports their claim by providing various reasons that support how Venus is worty of pursuit and how researchers may go about overcoming the dangers it possesses.

In order to support his/her claim, the author was able to provide at least three strong reasons that show how Venus would be worth studying, even though it presents many dangers. By explaining how Venus may have once been comparable to Earth, providing solutions to current problems, and expressing the benefits of studying Venus, the author is able to strongly support his/her claim with valid evidence.

223b86d,"The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life. However NASA has provided evidence that proves the face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. Through advancements in digital imagery, an understanding of shadows, and an understanding that there is no alien life evidence, it can be concluded that the face on mars is just a myth.

Today, we humans have the access to cameras with spectacular resolution. When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.

Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This excerpt from the article explains that the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows.

While many conspiracy theorists would still like to believe that aliens created this face on the moon, they are mistaken. With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found. However, others still argue.

Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct. However, NASA has nothing to gain from hiding information from the world. If anything, NASA would want the world to know about ancient aliens building landforms. The article mentions, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars."" This statement proves that NASA has no reason to hide information.

So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.

His Monday morning seems to be great until he jolt upright, suddenly remembering about the end-of-the-month report he was supposed to do over the weekend. Steve scrambles around his house, quickly changing into his work clothes and shoving food in his mouth as he runs out the door. As Steve drives to work, he tries to think of ways he can get the report done quickly, but he eventually prepares himself for the verbal lashing he will recieve from his boss. Steve can be anyone. Forgetting to do work is a common occurance. Steve, however, could have gotten the report done if he did not have to drive to work. A relatively new technology that could have saved Steve from his boss' rage is the driverless car. A driverless car, obviously, does not require a driver most of the time. Google and many other car companies have been trying to perfect the driverless car by making the car not require a driver. There are many pros to driverless cars that far outweigh the cons. Driverless cars are more safe and saves time for the driver.

Every year, many people die in car accdients, whether the victim was the driver or an innocent pedestrian. Driverless cars can potentially lower the rate of car accidents. Unlike humans, driverless cars can detect objects around them with multiple sensors installed in the car. The Google-modified Toyota Prius uses nine sensors - ""position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel,

a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"" (Paragraph 4). Also, the rotating sensor on the roof, called the LIDAR, makes a 3-D model of the cars surroundings. With all of these sensors, the driverless car can detect objects or people that a normal human driver cannot see, as there are many blindspots that a human driver has to be wary of. Also, the car can also ""cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine"" (Paragraph 5) based on the information received from the sensors. This gives the car ""better response and control than an a human driver could manage alone"" (Paragraph 5).

Although the idea of a driverless car sounds appealing, the current cars developed do not drive the full amount of time. The cars needs to alert the driver in special situations like work zones and driveways. Therefore, drivers need to be alert the whole time just in case one of these special situations pop up. If you have to be alert the whole time, why not just drive in the first place? Also, what happens if the car hits someone? Would it be the driver's fault or the manufacturer's fault? There are legal issues that can be avoided if humans just drove the cars in the first place like they have been doing for the past century. In addition to the legal problems and the drive time problem, the car can become faultly, like a computer that got a virus. This time, the consequences of faulty electronics are much higher than just replacing a computer. The car could end up taking someone's life.

The current driverless car does not drive the entire time. However,Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are expected to have cars that can drive of 90% of the time. Yes, there is a 10% chance that a human driver might have to take over but the 90% of the time that the driver is not driving, he or she can do work or just relax. Even if the driver fell asleep, there are many ways that the car can wake the driver up, like vibrating seats, sounds, and bright lights. Cars can be developed to become better at driving in traffc zones. The human instanct, however, cannot be developed to be more cautionous all of the time. Also, the legal issues do not present a problem. Laws often change to adapt with the times. Courts and lawmakers can debate on the issues, resolve them, and change the laws so that they can accomodate conflicts that the drierless car might present.

Driverless cars can solve many vehicle-related safety issues and lower the accident rate. Also, they give the driver more time to do whatever he or she wants to do. There are very little cons that come with the driverless car, and the ones that do come up can be easily solved. Driverless cars should be allowed to continue to develop so that eventually, they can replace humans drivers and make the roads mroe safe. Steve, too, can get a happy ending by frantically finishing is report while his new driverless car can take him to work.      ",6,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" each section explains the valuable improvements technolody is making; however, one can argue that this new Facial Action Coding Sysytem may not excel in the classroom. This system enables a computer to read the expressions of humans but this may not be as effective as it seems. The author explains that this system could be used in the classroom in order to benefit the students lessons. This may be effictive to some degree; however, the computer system can not understand the students thought process. The Facial Action Coding Sytem would not be as valuable in the classroom in order to read the emotional expressions of students.

The Coding System created by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe is a computer that uses a 3-D model of the face in order to ""claculate"" the expressions and emotions of a human. Prof. Huang and Sebe also collaborated with a psychologist in order to simplify the machine toread and code six basic emotions. These six basic emotions- happiness, fear, surprise, anger, disgust, and sadness- do not cover the overall nature of human expressions. This is already one fault in the idea. Students in any grade level have many different ways of expressing their feelings and emotions whether that be through nonverbal facial recongnition or body movement. The ""basic six"" would not accurately cover each expression portrayed by the user and it could lead to a simple, yet common mix up.

Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" When broken down Dr. Huang is stating that the system could replace a human instructor in order to teach the student based on his or her emotional reaction to the lesson being taught. This is not a valuable asset for stdents who may simply not enjoy the lesson being taught, whether they understand it or not. A common stereotype is that all highschool students are tired, which for the most part is accurate, whcih could confuse the system with the idea that the student is unhappy about the lesson. An honors student may then have the lesson simplified to a point it is no longer of any value to the learner. According to renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, ""Putting on a happy face actually Works!"" This is another reason the system could be easily decieved with false readings of a student. They could simply put on their happy face and a computer attempting to read the emotion of that person would not be ""calculating"" an acutal emotion. This would not benefit the student's learning process nor their social relationships.

Social relationships are a major part throughout school and this system would take a lot of the interaction away from students and teachers. Unable to help students, the social nature in interactions between students and higher authorities would be negative. Dr. Huang notes that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This may be true; however, taking away the interactions and basic knowledge of students manners could be harmful. Even though there are pros to this system, such as video surgery that make computer-animated faces more expressive, there is not a need for the system in an everyday classroom.

Facial Coding in the classroom would not benefit the stuents learning process or social interractions. There are myriads of ways to express emotions nonverbally without facial recognition. Six basic emotions may not accurately decribe the feeling of ones current stae of mind in the classroom, which could affect the lesson given to him or her. Social relatiosnhips could be lost when relying on a machine to determine one anothers feelings and ""putting on happy faces"" may damper ones ability to express their emotions. The Facial Action Coding System would not be valuable to the students in a classroom environment.                ",6,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

2f3bda4,"Have you ever been faced with a boring computer assignment? Maybe you have dreaded coming to school or finishing your homework? As technology is advancing and more of the classroom is found through an electronic device, some students may find themselves losing interest in their daily lessons. What if this could be changed by a system that takes your facial expressions into account and accomodates to your mood? Right when the assignment has begun to lose your interest, this system could sense the change and alter the lesson plan to regain your interest. The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students.

Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons. Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow"" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student.

By the same token, using this sort of technology in the classroom will keep a student engaged during their lessons. When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, ""[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and further explains that ""[the system] could modify the lesson"" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can ""identify mixed emotions"" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged.

Finally, this system may change the ways in which many students view school. It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a ""fake smile"" and that to them ""faces don't lie"" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them"" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.

Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students. Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately. This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether. If you had the choice to experience in this program within your classroom, what do you thing the outcomes may be?

30c179a,"Driverless cars, is this in our future? Driverless cars have become a growing topic in the past years. Recently, more information has become visible to the general public. Are these cars a good idea? I believe driverless cars are not needed in the near future. Development of these cars is an unneeded advancement in technology. Driverless cars, as of the technology we are now given, are not as reliable as an independent driver, they invade your privacy, and it would take more money to install technology in roads to be able to make use of these cars. Driving is a symbol of independence, in the sense that you are given the responsibilty and freedom to go virtually any location you please by driving yourself there.

Self driving is a commonly used way of transportation amongst many individuals. Driving is a way of transporting ones self from point A to Point B. When most individuals are driving, the average spped exceeds 25 mph. Driverless cars are only reliable for simple driving functions up to 25 mph. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars are completely driverless."" If driverless cars were to become a prominent part of every driver's life, would it be very practical? In the article, the author states what the cars are capable of, even with the driverless technology, the car will never be fully independent. The car is not completley driverless, this will be an unneccassary advancement until manufacturers create a truly driverless vehicle. So, using these new cars may be seemingly pointless, as the driver will still need to be paying attention and the car has sensors to make sure the driver is paying attention. This leads me to my next point, is a driverless car worth giving up your privacy?

Driverless cars not only have sensors on the wheels to make sure you are paying attention, they have cameras on your dashboard to ensure you are paying attention. ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" While some people may argue this is for the safety of the driver, there is no valid reasoning that there should be a manufacturer watching your every move to ensure you are paying attention on the road. Cars that have been driven that are not driverless have been doing, overall, well. While drivers are able to pay attention to the road regularly, having a camera creates an unwanted pressure to the driver. Adding the pressure of knowing you are constantly being watched as a driver can raise your stress levels, resulting in frustrated driving. Frustrated driving is an unsafe form of drivng, where as driving while relaxed and unwatched, relieves the pressure of knowing you are not the only person in the car. In addition, in the current days and in the past, has there ever been a need for manufacturers to put a camera in your dashboard to make sure you are driving safely? The answer to that question is no. Drivers, while not being watched, are expected to follow the laws and pay attention. Using cameras in the car and invading the privacy of the driver is an unneccasary addition, as there will only be use for the driverless portion of the car for up to 25 mph; therefore there is no further reasoning to begin developing these new vehicles.

If driverless cars are only useful for up to 25 mph, is there really any practical use for them? If driverless cars become the new form of transportation, there will be money involved that a lot of people do not have. Having smart cars requires smart-roads, ones that can communicate with the car to ensure the safest possible driving experience. ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" When manufacturers create these smart roads complementary to their smart cars, who will be paying for them? The most likely answer is a raise in already inflated car prices. When the smart-roads are installed, hypothetically speaking, will the road be smart enough to communicate with all different manufacturers types of cars? Will they allow regular cars to drive on them? How long will the instillation take and will it be on every road? These are all things that require time and money. Manufacturers see the big picture of driverless cars running the roads, but that simply can not be the case, given all of the obstacles needing to be overcome and all of the questions that require answers. With all of the money it will require to run cars that are still dependent on drivers, will there be any valid reasoning to spend all of this money on new roads and new car development?

With all of the advancements in technology, there should be a threshold to the items consumers want versus what they need. Manufacturers should not be trying to create new technology, but improving what they already have created. Using driverless cars, still require a driver to pay attention and take control after a certain point, invade your privacy by watching you with a camera, and require more money to create the new road systems and create new cars. In conclusion, I believe there is no practical reasoning that these cars should be further developed. ",6,3.0,3.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

34f1c56,"The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is higly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people allign themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush. The Electoral College should be kept in use because it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote.

To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" ""This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election, but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions.

In addition, the Electoral College eliminates the unfair advangate of having a bigger state, allowing smaller states to have a significance in the election."" The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them. People might claim that large states deserve more representation because more people live in them, but this doesn't preserve the equality for other smaller states's citizens that the United States stands for. This makes it apparent that without the Electoral College only the ""big states"" would matter and the candidates wouldn't have to worry about the small states.

Finally, the Electoral College does its best to eliminate the issue of not being able to determine the winner when the majority vote does not differ. "" Most states have a winner-take-all system that  awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This stops the problem that occured in 1968 with Nixon and 1992 with Clinton, and provides a clear definite way to choose the winner. If the Electoral College wasn't in use, lengthy recounts and much controversy would follow elections to try to determine if the votes were fair; this would cause too much strife and unrest within the country. It can be argued that even with the conflict it provides the people a chance to make their votes count, but it does more harm than good and it doesn't truly change anything. As a result, the Electoral College solves the issue of uncertainty and significance of vote.

In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.    ",6,4.0,4.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

394b71b,"Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.

Strangley, the author of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars""

suggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was ""a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,"" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.

Ultimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?

All in all, there is no ""true"" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature. There is no recorded history of the face moving. Also, what ""face"" is the size of man made Mt. Rushmore? In the text, the author states, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" The author is trying to explain that technology has grown with the landmark, and a sharper picture actually reveals an alike picture of the landform that had no sign of any life. The author explained in the text that the high resultion camera was so strong that pyramids, airplanes on the ground, or even the small shacks that you see when you drive down the interstate were crystal clear. This means that the Face had to have been landforms that one person might have mistaken for life on another planet.

On the other hand, some may also say that they is no proof. The Face could just as well be life on another planet, but there is no true evidence to prove so. In fact, scientist have came up with more ways that the Face is not life rather than if it was. For instance, in the text the author stated, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West,"" and, "" Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" With all this said, the Face could have a slight chance of being real life; however, it is highly unlikely that it is true life on another planet.

Ultimately, the Face shown on Mars is just a nautral landform. The Face cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence. All in all, life is changing all around us. New technoloy is being formed, but with a new generation who is ready to show the world what really is in the solar system. The future is in your hands. Find out what is next. Make your mark on the world.                  ",6,4.0,4.0,,":

3a2b8f0,"The electoral college must go down! The electoral college is unfair to voters across the United States and the amounts of electoral votes doesn't compare to the actual population. The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States. This system of electoral colleges voting for the president and not actually counting the votes that the people in the United States vote for, which makes it a very outdated system. Using popular vote is more precise and accurate than the electoral college. Popular vote is voted by citizens in which many people not including me should change the electoral system for the popular vote system. Therefore, the electoral college must go down and replaced by a system called the popular vote to determine the president of this great country.

Having electoral voters instead of having the popular vote system is unfair to all. Basically the electoral college process consists of only a selection of the senators. The founding father have established this messed  up system in which it compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress. It is highly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. This means canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. For example, they only focus on the ""swing states"" like California. Using the winner-take-all system, smaller states don't get the same oppurtunity as bigger states as in the year of the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see any canidates at all including, Rhode Island and South Carolina which holds the largest media markets. Yet these states didn't get to see a single campaign ad in the designated area.

Not only that using this system is unfair to all, but this system of electoral votes don't compare to the population. Meaning the 500,000 voters in a state of Wyoming who wants the other president to win, only have one representative to cast that vote in that whole state of that immense population. While California in the other hand have 55 representatives to cast the votes, in which the represent 35 million voters in that state. Using popular vote, is much more of a precise method or sytem to use. Instead of having one representative from one small state of 500,000 people, the popular votes turned in by qualified citizens will count than just 55 representatives. Imagine having each and everyone's vote count instead of having someone to do it for you. Now that is when people should start voting.

Using the popular vote will indeed avoid many crisis that happened using the electoral system. For example, the election that almost turned into complete disaster in the year of 1960 when Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent"". This couldv'e been easily fixed if the government at this time would take off the electoral system college and instead use a precise system that many people want, named the popular vote. Popular vote is basically when the people have ""the voice"" and speak for themselves and not to another person. Another example would be in the year 2000 when U.S. presidential race, Al Gorereceived more individual votes that George W. Bush nation wide, but Bush wonthe election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. With popular vote, Al Gore wouldv'e won the presidency and the citezens of the United States would've gotten what they wanted instead of having people vote for them. This is why population vote should be in effect as soon as possible.

Using popular vote would be a great and ideal way to decide who is the president during the nationwide election. It should be important to many people as we the people of the United States decide who will take over the countries' responsibility and economy. Yes, the popular votes is a great and ideal way to vote but having electoral colleges will avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. However, they can fix this problem by eliminating the electoral votes process. Therefore, it makes it clear that having a popular vote to deide who is the winner would be better when it is election time.

Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best. Abolish the electoral system college once and for all!            ",6,3.0,,,":**

3b20650,"There are numerous mysteries of the world that mankind is only on the verge of solving.

From Stonehenge to the Great Pyramids of Giza, historians as well as the public has a surplus of both logical and outrageous theories as to where these icons began.

One example of this is the Face on Mars.

The Face has become a symbol of its own and many believe there to be a correlation with alien life.

However, I, as a scientist, am certain that the Face is simply a natural landform rather than an alien creation due to my knowledge that NASA has taken multiple pictures of the formation and reached this conclusion, NASA has no logical reason to hide evidence if it were present, and because planet Earth has similar formations found in nature.

In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor or MGS image depicted a shocking sight for those down on Earth.

According to ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", an article discussing the mysterious Face, ""...it[Viking 1] spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.""

After their initial reactions, the rational scientists arrived at the conclusion that the sight was in reality, ""...just another Martian mesa"".

They carried on to unveil the finding to the public who some of whom responded claiming the Face is certain proof of Martian life.

NASA has stood by their belief, taking numerous shots of the Face since the original spotting.

As recently as of April 8, 2001; newer photographs using the newest techonology have shown the Face for what it really is.

Jim Garvin, the chief scientist of the Mars Exploration Program, describes tthe intent saying, ""We felt this was important to taxpayers.

We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.

The clarity of these recent pictures is much improved upon those shot by the 1976 Viking.

In fact Garvin again claims, So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

True scientists understand that in order to prove a theory valid, one must utilize multiple data collections rather than one outlier.

NASA has indeed done so in the case of the Face on Mars.

Another reason for believing what I do is the fact that NASA is a professional organization which of course seeks funding and a fair reputation as much as anyone else.

Although many conspiracy theorists claim ""NASA would rather hide"" evidence of life on Mars, this could not be farther from the truth.

According to the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

This is completely logical as recently funding for NASA has only decreased, seemingly along with the public's interest in space exploration.

This being the case, why on Earth would it be sensible for NASA to attempt any sort of cover up regarding evidence of alien life such as the alleged Face on Mars?

Finally, to verify NASA's knowledge that the Face is just a natural landform, is the observation which no one can deny: our planet Earth is abundant in formations such as the Face.

In fact, the mesa which the Face really is, is fairly similar to those found on Earth.

These landforms are particularly common is the western region of North America.

In fact, Jim Garvin states, It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Although Mars and Earth differ is many ways, the two neighboring planets share similar land formations such as these.

The Face is but a specific example of this.

After examining NASA's numerous verification attempts through the means of photography, the fact that NASA has no known motive to hide the alleged ""evidence"", and observing our own planet and its characteristics, it is clear to see that the Face is indeed nothing more than a naturally-occuring landform.

Undeniably fascinating, the Face on Mars is similar to many other wonderous works of nature.

As humans, it is only natural to find these perplexing and interesting.

However, science should not be refuted by simple fascination.

Instead, science should be utilized as a tool to explain the source of these out-of-this-world discoveries.",6,4.0,,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue of the Face on Mars and demonstrates strong critical thinking.

3b755b3,"In the excerpt, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author does not support their idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers it presents, all to well, they start off by listing several details that correspond with the exploration of the planet. Such as details of the physical state of the planet in correlation to Earth, but then list the dangers of Venus itself, plans that are backed by science to give human life a CHANCE, but not ideal living conditions on the planet.

To begin, The author starts off supporting their idea of Venus being worthy of exploring by writing about how Venus is somewhat similar to Earth, in the physical aspects, they state the Venus is often referred to ""Earth's Twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" They describe how long ago Venus was, ""Covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth,"" but they do not mention or go into detail as to what happened to the lakes, as a reader I'm curious as to what happened to the planet, and why it is the way it is today. The author also incorporates a description of the landscape on Venus, they write, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as Valleys, Mountains, and Craters,"" the description of the landscape sounds interesting because it is being described sort of like the Grand Canyon, because of the mountains, valleys, and other physical aspects.

Furthermore, the author begins to dive into to the several dangers that go with exploring Venus, they describe the atmosphere as, ""Almost 97 percent carbon dioxide."" In my opinion a world with an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide does not sound like the most fun thing. Also being described by the author are the clouds that coat the planet and are filled with, ""Highly corrosive sulfuric acid,"" to me as a reader this sounds more like a death wish rather than a ""worthy pursuit.""

More dangers that the author lists, is the temperature and the atmospheric pressure. ""Temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times higher than what we experience on our own planet. these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarineaccustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans, and liquefy many metals."" Those few sentences do not support the claim and idea made by the author that it would be a worthy pursuit. along with blazing temperatures and crushing pressure come with, ""erupting bolcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightening strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

Next, the author continues their ideas with a plan made by NASA, where scientists would ""explore"" by living in a blimp-like structure that hovers about 30 miles above the planets surface. Even 30 miles above the ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close the that of sea leavel on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but, survivable for humans."" Being in the blimp hovering above the planet would be pointless due to the atmosphere being so dense that most forms of light cannot penetrate it. also stated by the author is, ""More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" However, the author states that NASA is working on taking different approaches to studying the planet by using, ""Technology called mechanical computers....these devices played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.""

Lastly, the author does not support his/her ideas of ,""Venus being worth of pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" the author does list several benefits and interesting facts of exploring the planet, but unfortunatly in my opinion the dangers greatly outweigh the risks in physically being on the planet. Now if they conveyed exploring the planet from a far, and with robots and not actual people then I would be all for it. ",6,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

3d098ec,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, and does not prove that there is alien life on Mars. The Face was created simply by poor camera quality and an optical illusion. The later pictures of the Face taken in 1998 and 2001 prove this theory even further. If you look at the later pictures, you can clearly see that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation. NASA is also in support of finding alien life, so they would have no reason in trying to disprove that aliens are not real. So, the face is nothing more than an optical illusion, and not something created by aliens.

The Face on Mars is nothing more than an optical illusion and a natural formation working together. If you look at the picture of the Face from 1976, then it is very convincing proof that the face was the work of aliens. However, the picture of the Face that was taken in 2001 shows that the Face is simply a rock formation with shadows where the eyes and mouth should be. This is also proven with the picture that was taken in 1998. Even though there is clouds over the Face, you can still tell that there is no alien creation in the picture. Garvin brings up a comparison of the Face to a ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" which is a ""lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" By drawing this comparison, it gives us something we can easily compare the Face to on Earth. People don't claim that the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain"" was created by aliens, yet it is easily comparable to the Face.

Alien life on Mars would support NASA. It would bring great attention to the space program, and more funding. If NASA were to find aliens, they wouldn't hide it from the public. Whenever the picture was first taken in 1976, NASA released it to the public only a few days after it was taken. Although the picture had a theory to disprove that it was the creation of aliens along with it, NASA still released it almost immediatly. This is proof that NASA is in support of finding alien life becuase they were not afraid to release something that could possibly prove it. Even after NASA ended the Viking missions, they still went back to take more photos of the Face. This would either prove the conspiracy theorists even more, due to advancments in technology which would allow for higher resolution photos, or it would prove NASA's theory that shadows were creating the optical illusion. The pictures helped the case of the latter. Because of how much clearer the picture taken in 1998 is compared to the picture taken in 1976, you are able to see much more detail of the Face, and can easily tell that it is just a mesa. Conspiricy theorists claimed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze in the picture, which would later be disproved by the very clear picture taken in 2001. So, if NASA were not in support of finding alien life, why would they release three pictures that could possibly prove alien life?

In conclusion, the face was not created by aliens. NASA is also not trying to hide any evidence for alien life on Mars, so if this were the creation of aliens, NASA would fully support it. NASA released three photos of the Face, all which had the possibility of proving that it was the creation of aliens, yet they still released them. So, if NASA wanted to hide alien life, why would they release anything to hint at it?",6,4.0,4.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 4

3d9c7b9,"As a young child peers into the endless night sky from his bedroom window, a bright flickering spot catches his eye and leaves a single question in his mind: ""Is there anybody there?"" In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author writes about that same bright spot, known as Venus, and explains that studying this planet will real human scientists is worth it despite the many obstacles it raises. By including staggering information of the endless hazards and later reassuring their readers with astonishing facts and likely solutions to survival, the author clearly supports their ideas very well. There may just be a chance for us to see Venus as more than just a bright little star after all.

Initially, the author puts more focus to the first half of their claim as they describe the dangers of this not-so-easy planet. The author informs us that even mighty submarines would not stand a chance in the undoubtably strong Venusian atmosphere; they continue to say that most metals would simply melt under its pressure (paragraph 3). By including such daunting information that makes human life anywhere near Venus seem impossible, it can easily be seen that the author supports that Venus is no cake-walk. Also in paragraph three, the author includes ""additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes"" in the background of Venus's already packed daily weather forecast. The author used these earthly disasters and explained how they happen regularly on Venus to prove just how many abstacles there are for scientists who wish to go to the planet, furthure showing their understanding of the idea that putting humans of Venus could be very harmful. Thankfully, exploring this scary planet has its hopeful side.

Near the middle of this passage, the author begins to turn Venus, no pun intended, and the conversation on taking humans there to a more positive angle. In paragraph four, the author writes about how Venus most likely used to be much like the place we currently live; it had amazingly Earth-like characteristics like huge oceans, mountains, and possibly even life similar to ours. With such exciting facts that leave even more questions about the mysterious planet, the author is proving to us that they know Venus has secrets worth uncovering. The author later tells the readers of a plan by NASA to make is possible to harbor human scientists near the Venusian surface by using a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles [above Venus]..."", informing that the situation would in fact be viable for life (paragraph 5). The author showed how they highly agree with the part of their idea that analyzing Venus up close should happen by giving a reassuring soulution from such a well known and trusted organization as support. Exploring our planet's twin seems like it's not such a giant leap anymore, rather, it looks like it will only take a few small steps.

Keeping all of this information in mind, it is clear that the author is a firm beleiver that Venus, although it has put many seemingly impenatrable obstacles in our way, is worth taking a look at with human eyes. If we follow calls to action such as this, we will put the human race just that much closer to understanding the mysteries of the infinite universe around us, but Venus is a good starting point. As a young boy's eyes slowly slide shut, he can still see a tiny flahing light shining through the darkness outside his window blinds; he dreams of the day he can finally meet it.",6,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

406731a,"The electoral college system has been part of America for many years. At times, this system has proved to be a good thing for our country, but in most times, it has not. I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I am in favor of changing to a popular vote because of the unfairness, faulty aspects, and electors in the electoral college.

To begin, the electoral college is fair in some ways, but mostly not. One may understandably say that ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"" (Posner, 22). The electoral college has proved to be a balance to the political weight of the large states, but regardless of the size of the state, it should be a citizen right to vote directly for their president. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plumer, 13). This quote shows the unfairness to the voters, those in the smaller/more insignificant states don't even matter because of the electoral college! When voting, citizens also become confused with the electors, and potentially vote for their opposing party. Not only is the electoral college unfair for the voters, but for the presidental canidates as well. We as citizens vote for electors whom we must entrust to vote for the party's nominee. This trust is rarely betrayed, but ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral bote will not win the national popular vote"" (Posner, 16). In 2000, the election with Al Gore and George Bush, Gore won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral vote. The people wanted Gore to be the president, but he did not win, due to the unfairness of the ellectoral college.

Another reason I am in favor for the popular vote, is because of the faulty aspects of the electoral college system. A counterargument may be that the electoral college has held our country together, making the voting system a lot easier. But in my opinion this is not true. With popular vote, the citizens would just vote for the president, and whichever canidate recieves the most votes would win. But in the case of the electoral college, states cast only one vote for the entire state! "".. the single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California"" (Plumer, 12). The reason this is such a big deal is because, let's say that 10,000 people voted in Wyoming. 5,001 were republicans, and 4,999 were democrats. The electoral college would pick the elector representing the republican candidate. Thus, Wyoming's vote goes to the republican canidate. Without the ellectoral college though, those 4,999 votes would count, and would go toward helping the desired canidate win. Voting is an individual effort, and the electoral college does not allow for this.

As well as this fault, another fault is the fact that the electors could be anyone. ""They can be anyone not holding public office... Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer, 10). Although in most cases the electors vote for the correct party, an elector still may not be trustworthy, or loyal. They may even be bias and vote for a different candidate. The electors do not campaign. Only the presidental canidates do. When we vote for the president, we are actually voting for the electors. Voters normally know little, to nothing about the electors. This makes for an even faultier voting experience.

To conclude, electoral colleges are not the way the voting system should be. With popular voting, there will be an assurance that the right candidate will win, the unfair ways of the ellectoral college will be diminished, and there will no longer be any faulty aspects of the voting system. Citizens vote to be heard, and with the electoral college, the people aren't heard as loud as they should be. Voting is a right and priveledge of an American citizien, and popular voting will ensure this right.    ",6,4.0,4.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 4

418f0dc,"Cars have always been known for their efficiency, and speed at which they bring their driver to his or her desired destination. Although, many people are aware of the causes of driving and the negative effects of a car, most never look at the possibilities. They don't know what they are being deprived of due to the simple, solvable problem of driving cars. As countries of the world experience a cultural shift in their daily lives, people are becoming aware of the significant advantages of limited car usage, including lower emissions, increased physical activity, and decreased stress, which in turn would increase overall pleasure.

With a change in one's daily life, the linear relationship between car usage and carbon emmissions, means that as car usage decreases so does pollution. In ""The End of Car Culture,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal comments on the scientific opinion regarding this cause and effect relationship in America: ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" Cars are a large contributor to the increasing amount of waste and toxins that make one's air water polluted. Therefore, with a drop in the usage of cars, people and land will be become healthier and cleaner. Emissions are also a problem in Europe where the ""Day Without Cars"" was used to promote ""alternative transportation"" in order to reduce ""smog.""(Selsky) Cars are often used get to specific places such as work or school. So why would two people drive two seperate cars if they're going to the same place? By using public transportation such as a bus or subway, one is killing two birds with one stone by using a smaller amount of gas and fossil fuels to delivery two people to their desired locations, a smarter and cleaner choice.

The limit on car usage has also caused an increase of physical activities within a society. The lack of cars has created the desire for outdoor involvement as Andrew Selsky suggests in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" when he informs people of the ""improvement caimpaign in Bogota"" that has enouraged the ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths."" Since space is no longer needed for the creation of parking lots, people now have ample room to create the resources needed for activities such as bike riding. Just having things such as trails visible to the public, motivates people to be active. The possibilities of physical activity areas are also encouraged by a change in the transportation bill. In current years, a drastic ""80% has gone to highways"" whereas only ""20% went to other transport.""(Rosenthal) With a decrease in the demand for cars and similiar ways of private transportation, there won't be a need for large highways. Since more money is now available to be used elsewhere, oppurtunities for parks and sports centers are opening up.

Although many may not be aware, a decrease in cars also brings a decrease in stress. This is even hinted at by ""Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza"" when he says ""'It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress...""(Selsky) Although people depend on cars for quick transportation, it can become a hastle when traffic comes into play. It also costs people lots of money when it comes to paying for gas, so an overall reduction of cars would fix all problems regarding stress. As a result of the reduction in car usage, several ""new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up,"" as Andrew Selsky informs the public in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" With an increase of space to build malls and social places, people have a better chance of staying relaxed and stress-free. Not only do these places enourage relaxation, but they provide a place for one to spend time with friends and family.

From driving hazardous and waste-producing cars to saving money, riding bikes, and hanging with friends at the mall, limiting car usage not only creates a healthier community but provides people with oppurtunities to be better. All around the world people are working to change their daily habits that have created the dirty world one lives in today. Limiting car usage creates an overall happier environment to live in and an endless amount of possibilities.    ",6,4.0,4.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 4

43d5bb4,"Computers are one of the best inventions ever made by humans because they have enabled everybody around the world to connect to the Internet. The Internet fuels most peoples lives because of the sheer amount of accessible information about anything and everything. However, should we let computers start making their own decisions? Thomas Huang is the creator of a computer software that allows computesr to read human emotions using 3-D modeling and analyzing muscle movements in the face. At first glance, this appears to be an interesting concept, but there could be several downsides to this type of invention such as overall practicality, implementation in today's society, and even safety and security issues.

First of all, is a software that can read our emotions actually useful? There is potential for this type of software to be used on people for occasions such as a interrogation where the suspect could be lying and the software could detect a quivering lip. On the other hand, this type of software is most likely not going to make it into the homes of the people which presents a business problem. Their solution is to introduce the software into schools to be used for enhancing the learning experience. Dr Huang describes how computers in the classroom could ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"" resulting in a better learning environment for the student. The issue is, not every student needs this, and many will prbably disagree with having this software implemented in their school. So, this type of computer software has few areas that it will probably be used causing it to be less practical than it originally seems.

Secondly, how will FACS (Facial Action Coding System) be implemented into a society that is normally unwilling to new changes regarding their technology? People want improvements, but they don't want change. For example, when an application has an update most people update it without giving it a second thought because the newer it is the more likely it will be ""better"" than the previous version. But, when a new phone comes out with plenty of changes people are skeptical and wait for their friend to buy it before they consider purchasing one themselves. So, as a result, people will most likely be skeptical of a software that is able to read emotions because it is something new and no one has any experiences with it yet. This causes FACS to seem like a software that won't be implemented or at least widespread for a long time.

Lastly, will the common person feel like their privacy is being invaded with this new software? For FACS to work the user must have a camera or some kind of scanning device that is able to detect individual muscles. A highly accurate scanning device in the common home will most definitely scare some people out of having this type of software. For example, some people believe that they are already watched through their smartphone camera even though they don't have any form of evidence of such actions taking place. A natural fear of invasion of privacy is part of human nature and cannot be changed. In paragrpah seven D'Alto, the author, mentions that FACS can detect a fake and a real smile which only solidifies the softwares scanning precision. What if someone was talking with their boss using their computer and they lied to protect their job? Although this kind of action should result in that person being punished or fired FACS could use the camera on the computer to see that they were lying and report it to the person's boss or company. Now, this situation is impractical and hopefully it never happens, but the idea that FACS has the ability to use a camera in the home to do whatever they want is scary and will drive people away from using it.

In conclusion, FACS will probably be used for specific tasks only, but it is interesting to ponder the potential for similar softwares in the future. The main problem that Dr. Huang will face is trying to show the people the trustworthiness of the product. If there is too much skepticism from the people it simply won't be found around the world and rather only in more secluded places such as labs or research facilities for testing purposes. In the future, other softwares will be created and maybe they will have the potential to impact the world in influential, innovative, and successful ways.                              ",6,3.5,,,":**

44bca10,"The face on Mars really is just a landform. I've seen the landform before on our very own home planet. My family and I were going to Grand Canyon for a vacation. Life had been rough so we decided we deserved to see the country a little bit. Upon arriving in Arizona, I saw hundreds of mesas, which are landforms that look like faces. I was petrified at first, until I learned they were merely landforms. The first time I saw the alledged ""Face on Mars,"" I knew it was merely a landform. I believe the Face is a landform and not an alien figure because it was exaggerated by Hollywood and the media, it would be better for NASA if it were an alien life form, and there are already lots of similar landforms on Earth.

Hollywood, its the home of the media. Of course the media will do anything for views. As soon as they found out about the Face, they jumped all over it. For instance, in paragraph 5, the author quotes, ""The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon."" This implies that it really wasn't a big deal before it started to become popularized. Paragraph 5 also shows us that it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in magazines, books, radio talk shows, and even was told in checkout lines for 25 years. The Face was an icon of its time, and thus was twisted to seem like an alien figure.

Moving on, why would NASA want to keep an alien a secret? If NASA actually did find an alien, they would want to let the world know so that they'd have more funding. In paragraph 5, we are told that the NASA budget wishes that there was an ancient civivlization of Mars. This proves that it would help NASA pay off debts and would make them more popular in the face of the public. It is also stated in paragraph 7 that Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, had a few words to say.

""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim said. This exemplifies that NASA knew it was only a landform, but they wanted to take pictures so that the public would pay them more.

A third reason for my believing is that there are already many landforms like this. The landform is called a mesa. As I said earlier, I've seen many of these landforms in Arizona. We are shown in paragraph 7 that when the picture of The face first appeared on a JPL web site, it showed that there was no alien monument, only a landform. This proves to us that sure, if you take a picture from a certain angle, it looks like a face; when you take it from a different angle, it looks like the landform that it is. This is similar to the Man on the Moon. We know that it is just a bunch of craters, making it look like a human figure. In the final section, 12, Garvin states a perfect example.

""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is an excerpt from the passage that demonstrates how the Face is no different from our landforms on Earth.

Some might say that the face is actually an alien monument, and that NASA just doesn't want the public to know. But, what they don't realize is that NASA would benefit from seeing an alien life form. The public would love it, and the money would start rolling in. The author tells us that defenders of the NASA budget actually wish that there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars.

It seems that life gets so boring for people that they make any little thing seem amazing. This is shown through the fact that people made a landform appear as an alien monument. Through all the incomplete theories, I still believe that the Face is purely a landmark. I believe this because hollywood and the media exaggerated it greatly, the discovery of alien life would actually benefit NASA, and there are many landmarks on Earth and Mars that represent the supposed ""Face of Mars.""",6,4.0,4.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

4649f4f,"As technology advances in a very constant and remarkable fasion, many new innovations begin to reveal themselves. While we still might be waiting for the next flying car or teleporter, several smaller, yet very significant, inventions have presented themselves. An example of this is a computer software that is able to identify and recognize emotions. Profesor Thomas Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the Univeristy of Illinois created this software in hopes of changing the world for the better, but is it really that great? Among the several other practical uses, Huang says that the use of this technology in the classroom can be the most important. Overall the use of emotional recognition has the potential to be useful due to the ability to change the lesson based on mood, and alter mood based on the current your current status, but overall would not be 100% effective due to the spiratic qualities of humans.

Dr. Huang, the inventor of the emotional recognition, claims there could be huge advancements in the education system due to his new technology. In a time of computer screens, video games, and the newest iphone students have trouble beign lectured for six hours a day. Dr. Huang's main goal is to put a computer with the lesson plans and his software in front of a computer so that it can do the teaching, effectivly. If a student begins to get bored and their zygomatic major muscles begin to relax and visibly show the boredom setting in, Dr Huang's computer software would be able to recognize and alter the lesson to be more engaging to the student. This would easily work for many other situations, if a student is sad the lesson could use brighter colors and better diction to create an enviorment where the student is not distracted and wants to learn. Nick D'Alto describes a situation where a student becomes very confused and does not know what they are doing and how to do it, but with the use of Dr Huang's technology the lesson could be changed and break down to easier steps to correctly compensate for the confusion.

Overall, the use of Dr. Huang's software to change a lesson would be very useful in improving the learning enviorment for the students who will go on to create equally as innovative new mechanism in the future.

Secondly, the software can be used to help change the mood of a student in order to boost morale as well as create an enviorment where the student wants to learn. In this day and age there are so many things for a student to be passionate about, such as: sports, video games, friends, and so much more. This is very good in the sense of passion but ultimately takes away from the desire to learn and become successful in school. Often times a student comes into school with the worst mood possible, hating every second of it, but Dr. Huang could change things up. For example if a student comes into school angry Dr. Huang's facial coding system would be able to create an enviorment where the lesson becomes more like a game for the student to play and enjoy while at the same time learning the content.

If a student comes into school depressed, it could be the job of the system to recognize this, notify someone, and help them be happy.

Dr. Huang's invention creates a short cut in seeing how someone feels through science. At times people are too afraid to ask ,""Are you okay?"". The use of this software can go straight to the aiding of someone without even having to think twice. In the end, emotions create roadblocks for students to learn and the use of Dr. Huang's technolgy can identify and help break them down so that a kid can be a normanl kid again.

Although Dr. Huang's software is extremly useful, things can often be a little more complicate than what technology can actually be good for. While the identifying of emotions is very useful, the actual action of neutralizing them can be beyond the machine. For example, if a student is crying their eyes out with no sign of stopping, I am pretty sure a change in the lesson will not help calm that student. If a student is so mad that they just want to break the computer and storm off, no change in the lessons music, colors, or diction is going to be able to fix that. In general an actual human is what each student needs to be there for them. The warmth of a hug or simple hand on the shoulder can change the outlook on a students entire emotional status. The fact that an actual teacher cares is more than enough to allow the teacher to keep teaching. Overall Dr. Huangs software is incredibly useful to identify emotional change but really can not help deal with most situations like a teacher would.

In conclusion Dr. Huang's software holds its value in it's ability to read emotions and alter the lesson as well as alter the mood of a student in need, but is very limited in how it can help a student get through their troubles. The use of Dr. Huang's technolgy in the classroom will definately lead to advances in student comprehension but for the many individuals that need more than a computer for sypathy, the program most likely will not work.

4b037f4,"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmoshere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town car-free. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completeley true since plug-in cars, hybrids, and other earth-friendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of foosil fuel-powered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual's decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come.    ",6,4.0,4.0,,"for Each Rubric Criterion:

4b50f50,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, a new techonology known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) provides computers and devices to identify emotions in humans. The techonlogy does this through scanning facial muscle movements and with basic psychology knowldege. However, this new techonlogy is also being proposed to being used in schools to have more effective schooling based on the emotions of students. The using of FACS to determine the emotinos of students is valuable because it allows for more interactive lessons that are based off of non-verbal communication, which will help students succeed at a higher level.

With the inception of FACS, the interactions between humans and computers can become more efficient, and will allow for more streamlined communication. In the article, Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcluding emotional communication"" (6). If in a classroom situation, a computer trying to teach a lesson with students might not be able to understand if its pupils are getting the concepts, or it wouldn't be able to dectect whether the students are paying attention or being engaged. Since most human interactions are non-verbal, the computer would have a hard time communicating with the students to understand what was wrong. With FACS, however, the computer can analyze non-verbal cues and alter its teaching style. This in turn would allow the students to have a better time and have a higher understanding of the materials being learned.

Not only does the concept and development of FACS allow for more streamlined communcation between humans and computers in the classroom, it also removers barriers between humans and computers by allowing computers to act more like humans, creating a more effective learning environment. In the article, D'Alto states that like how FACS learns to interpret emotions based on non-verbal facial cues, ""we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day""(5). This means that by giving computers/teachers the ability to accuratley identify emotins (to some extent), we are lessening the difference between a physical and a digitial teacher by making the computer more ""human"". In an age where the world is becoming more and more digital, it is a neccesity that students and computers are able to communicate effectively. If Dr. Huang's quote ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'""(4), is true, this means that if a computer can analyze mixed human emotions in a classroom setting, it is possible that not only will the computer modify lesson plans to make teaching more interesting, it will also have an almost artificial empathy, allowing for students to be more accepting of a digitial counterpart.

In addition to streamlining communication and being more relatable to students, the usage of FACS system in a classroom computer can also be used to solve conflicts and make resolutions between students. In the article, D'Alto states that some facial muscle movements, showcase negative emotinos and false emotions as well. One of these muslces is the orbicularis oris, which tightens one's lips to show anger(3). Furthermore, certain muslce cues ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(8). Since FACS is able to analyze these kinds of movements as well, it can detect when two students are angry at one another, or when a student is lying or being subtly disrepctful. By being able to recognize these situations, the FACS system can advise teachers on how to solve these various conflicts or negative scenarios and can be of use to better the general nature of the classroom.

Overall, throughout Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is shown that by using the technology known as FACS, communcation between humans and computers can be streamlined. When placed in a school, FACS is valuble because it modify lessons to make teaching more effective, be more relatable and approachable to students, and can resolve conflicts in a classroom. In the future, with more and more systems such as FACS being implemented, it is possible that soon computers will devlop emotions of their own!         ",6,3.5,,,":**

4d00492,"Dear Senator,

Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winner-take-all"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.

4e9bf56,"The development of a new, self-driving car that functions efficiently is being tested by various different companies, like Google and General Motors, but what practical purpose would this development solve? Some argue that these smart cars would increase traffic efficiency and could facilitate a new age of safe motor vehicles. Others argue that we cannot place our trust regarding safety solely in a machine. The creation of driverless cars should not be further developed, despite potential increase in safety, due to the increased dependency on technology it would facilitate, as well as liability issues regarding crashes or other potential accidents, both of which could negatively impact other aspects of the future.

Despite the issues of liability and dependency on technology, the development of new cars could potentially reduce safety risks associated with full human control over vehicles. Because ""the information from the sensors [of the driverless cars] can cause the car to apply brakes... allow a far better response and control than a human could manage,"" driverless cars may reduce potential for crashes of other incidents. Advanced sensor technology is indeed an asset to this new development, however taking this concept while maintaining human control could prove to be more benenficial, due to the lack of issues such as liability and also keeping humans active and engaged. The problem is that most people would nate place full trust in technology, thus eliminating the purpose of a ""driverless car"" being completely driverless. Ultimately, this potential asset is far outweighed by the costs of producing driverless cars.

Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road. As of right now, ""...none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This means that someone must always be in the driver seat to ensure safety when the situation requires them to take over. This, however, contradicts the purpose of the ""driverless car."" In addition, because the point of these cars is to drive safely without human control, people could have this in mind while in a driverless car. As a result they may give little regard to the road, and rely on the car to keep them safe and get them to their destination. Then, if they are not prepared for an alert or a need for human assistance, because they expected the car to handle it, their dependency on the car put their safety at risk.

The liability issues if such an accident were to occur could be tremendous. If there was an accident, the question would arise, "" who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This could lead to court trials and lawsuits that would either harm the consumers in the auto industry, or the producers. Either way, the costs would have an increasingly negative impact on the economy. It would not be logical to assume that these cars would be one hundred percent safe, as there is alway room for error, and ""presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver..."" Because many people refuse to place full trust in technology that could have potential flaws, if an accident were to occur, the industry of self-driving cars would likely crash, as people would more and more see this technology as danger, and place the blame on the auto industry.

If further developments were to be made so that these cars truly don't need a driver, while it may reduce safety risks, ultimately the costs regarding user dependency and liability would outweigh benefits. Increased dependency could actually create more safetly problems, and liability issues could result is a crash of the auto industry's smart technology branch. If the concept of this Driverless car were changed to, rather than have no driver, help the driver, then the outcome may be more beneficial. If people still drove the car, but with helpful alerts, warnings, or displays, traffic safety would go up, and the liability and dependency issues would be lessened or dissolved altogether. A new age of technological innovation is here, and utilizing this idea in this moderate waycould pave the road to a brighter future.",6,3.0,3.0,,"for each rubric criterion:

4f6582d,"While NASA's greatest scientists were working hard in their Jet Propulsion Lab in 1976, an eerie picture appeared on their monitors, as the spacecraft they sent to Mars, the Viking 1, has taken a picture of what looks like an alien-built human face on Mars, though it was actually another basic landform on the red planet. The reason Viking I was taking pictures of Mars was to scope out possible landing sites for its sister ship, the Viking 2. The scientists did realize that this ""face"" was just another common Martian landform, so when they put the picture up, its caption stated that it was only a rock formation resembling a human head. In order to fully prove to everyone that the Face on Mars was just a landform, they even sent the MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, to retake pictures of the area presumed to be the face. They even sent it back for another round of retakes thanks to peoples' suspicions of cloudy weather blocking the view of the face! Thanks to many tests and retakes, scientists have proven that the Face on Mars is just another landform.

While Viking 1 was taking pictures on Mars to find a landing site for Viking 2, it snapped a picture of what appeared to be a gigantic face staring at them like a man staring at the stars with binoculars. Although scientists were very surprised when the face appeared on the monitors in their lab, their sensation lasted only a short time. They figured it was only another common Martian mesa with shadows that only resembled a human face. So that they could get enough hey-everyone-check-this-out popularity for the red planet, they made the image of the Face on Mars public, and the NASA scientists gave it the caption noting that it was ""a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Thanks to this new caption, public attention for Mars, but it ended up dominating people's view on Mars, making them create conspiracy theories rather than convince the truth that it was only another landform on Mars. Despite the people making the Face on Mars a well-known pop icon, it always was and always will be another Martian landform.

In order to prove to the people that the Face on Mars was an ordinary-as-white-paint landform, they sent a new probe, the Martian Global Surveyor, or MGS, to Mars in 1998 to try to retake pictures of the face. The MGS succeeded at its task, as it swayed public opinion away from the idea that the face had to do with alien life existing on Mars at that time. Thousands of looking-forward-to-this web explorers were waiting for the picture to become public, they were also disappointed by the fact that it was a natural landform rather than an exotic alien monument. However, not everyone was satisfied with these results, as they wanted more proof that the face was a face and not a landform thanks to cloudy weather. The MGS did succeed in proving that the Face on Mars was not a face, though more attempts were required to get the idea to everyone.

Not everyone was content with the results of the MGS expedition, wanting to believe that the cloudy weather at the time the picture was taken to be responsible for the lack of the face's visibility. Despite how NASA's chief scientist for their Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, stated that ""it's not easy to target Cydonia,"" the people wanted more retakes. NASA was able to get the MGS to get better shots of the face in April 2001, and they were able to capture a wonderful photo with the camera's maximum resolution, which dominated the Viking 1's resolution by being nearly thiry times better. Thanks to Garvin's reasoning and the high-as-the-sky resolution of the MSG's new pictures, they were able to prove that the face was only the equivalent of a butte or mesa, both of which were common landforms. Thanks to the MSG's multiple trips, they captured enough well-detalied pictures to prove the true identity of the Face of Mars.

The Face of Mars is only an ordinary landform, and it always will be just another ordinary landform. The scientists began with a caption to the original photo stating that it was a landform only resembling a face, then they sent the Mars Global Surveyor out to try to prove that the Face on Mars was a landform. They also later sent the MGS out again during not-cloudy-at-all weather to let everyone know for sure that the face was not a face. All of these efforts combined let people know how the Face on Mars was not a face but only a landform, but there are likely still people out there who belive that the Face on Mars is still some type of alien relic. Despite how popular the conspiracy theories about the Face of Mars being an alien monument, it was only a standard landform the whole time.",6,4.0,4.0,,,,"Holistic Rating: 4

5091e12,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about a great number problems that come along with trying to get information on the our planetary neighbor, Venus. We, the readers, learn in detail about the specific challenges that come along with studying Venus, even with its close proximity to us. Despite the author describing all of the struggles that come along with studying our sister planet, the passage still supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwile pursuit, through giving us strong examples of useful information we could learn, and describing safer and easier ways that we could study it that would make it far more simple to get the desired data.

While there are certainly many difficulties that the passage describes about getting information from Venus, the author thoroughly explains all of the great scientific benefits that we could get out of a Venus mission. As the author describes in paragraph four, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Not only will information about Venus teach us more about the universe around us, it might just be useful in order to study our own planet. Being able to learn so much from what a previous Earth could have been like would be a massive benefit to fields like history, and the earth sciences. The author goes into even more detail about this just afterward, describing how ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only are they similar from a geological perspective, it could provide vital information to the studies of biology, and possibly even support details about where we came from to begin with. There are hundreds, if not thousands of scientists specifically studying the cosmos trying to find planets with water that even have a small chance of supporting any form of life. The potential for further discovery here only a short distance away is extrodinary, and the author wisely emphasizes this through the passage.

Not only is the possibility for fascinating exploration and gaining crucial information about the Earth from Venus supported, the author also makes the important point that we are coming closer and closer by the day to this becoming a reality. In the seventh paragraph the author discusses this idea. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" When they put some of the brightest engineers in the world to a specific task of making electronics that could survive in Venus, the results were successful, as they made them able to survive for almost a month. While a month doesn't sound like a long time for the equipment to last, the author mentions later on in the passage that ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme phyisical conditions."" The most delicate part any device that would land on Venus would be the electronics inside any rover or measuring equipment. The great advances in the durability of these electronics points toward an optimistic future in devices designed for Venus, as we are already seeing incredible progess being made. However, what would happen if they couldn't find a way around the delicacy of modern computers? The author proves that wouldn't be the end of our Venus hopes, that mechanical computers can be utilized in order to avoid easily broken hardware. Even in the worst case scenerio, our scientists are still devising ways to land a probe on Venus.

Though the author presents some great challenges in getting samples and other data from Venus, he strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through the development of new and better ways to survive the harsh atmosphere, and information that could be gained from it that is useful to studying scientific and historical fields back here on Earth that he mentions in the passage. The human race, throughout history, has always remained curious and are willing to sacrifice and go through long periods of experimentation to acheieve knowledge. We have faced these struggles as humans before, and this will not be the struggle that stops us. ",6,4.0,,,,,"Based on the provided essay and the rubrics, here is the evaluation for each criterion:

50d3e20,"Some people are better at hiding emotions than others, but with a recent innovation from Thomas Huang, a professer at the Bechman Institute for Advanced Science, hiding emotions may no longer be so easy. With the software that was recently created, computers can read emotions off of somebody's face. This information is discussed in Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" which talks about many of the aspects of what the Facial Action Coding System can do. Though there can be some cons with this software, they are out-weighed by all of the pros, especially ones found in classrooms. In classrooms if a computer can sense confusion, boredom, or even anger then a teacher can help the student with whatever barriers they are facing.

Classrooms contain various emotions, including anywhere from sadness to rage. According to D'Alto, ""...the software can even identify mixed emotions..."" That can be very valuable for classrooms so the software can read whether the student may be upset and confused, or bored and uninterested. Once the teacher gets ahold of that information then they will be able to help the student and tend to them by their needs. If a student is confused then the teacher will be more likely to be sympathetic and helpful, while if a student is bored then the teacher might give them more challenging work. Although some people may think that the Facial Action Coding System is a phony, it is proven to be otherwise. In fact, it is very well developed and the article states, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" Not only has this software been tested many times, it has been constructed so it can read facial muscles and destinguish the emotions well.

Along with the fact that the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers figure out how students are feeling about certain lessons, it also gives teachers more one on one time with students who need the help. D'Alto says that the software, ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" When the software does that, it can make a lesson harder for the people who need it or easier for others. Since the lesson can modify itself to the needs of students, that gives the teacher to go around and give help to those in need. Not only can a student get help from their computer, but they can get help from their teacher if needed to. That allows for a student to get two times the amount of help that they could get without the Facial Action Coding System. Some people may disagree with this and think that a computer does not have all of the resources that students need to understand a lesson. Though some people may think that face-to-face learning is more effective, it does not always work that way. In the article Dr. Huang says ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication... So computers needd to understand that, too."" Every student is different and learns differently. Many times communication is nonverbal and is just by facial expressions. If a computer can understand that as well a teacher does, there is no problem with computers helping out students.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System can help students is because if the students know others are confused as well, then they can help each other out. Dr. Huang says that, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" If students start to understand how others are feeling about certain concepts then they might not feel as alone. Some students tend to think that it is only them that do not understand a certain subject or unit, but if computers track and show that even though some people might not look worried and they are, students might feel more united. If they are united then that can help each other out and maybe even build friendships. People may disagree with that and say that not all facial expressions are the same, but, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression,"" they are still universal. While one student might be stressing himself out and have wide eyes, a student next to him might just have his eyebrows furrowed. If the computers identify the differences in actions but similarities in emotions, that can really help students.

The Facial Action Coding System is a huge leap in the computer world, and also the education system. If schools took this software into consideration and allowed students to use it, it woud be very beneficial for everyone around them. Kids would get work that suited their abilities and they could get one on one time with the teacher if needed. If the teacher was busy, if the students were able to identify others' emotions from around them, maybe they would not feel so scared to go up to a classmate and ask for help. The Facial Coding System holds many beneficial factors that could help grow the education system and help individual students grow.",6,3.0,,,":** The student effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

5266ddf,"Dear Senator,

The robust political system of the American government is greatly hindered by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isn't completely representative of what citizens really want. History will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elector who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please.""

(Paragraph 11)

Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting.

Time and time again, we have been shown that the Electoral College is nothing but a gimmick and ""a compromise between election of President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

(Paragraph 1)

by the founding fathers. Maybe that had worked in the past, when the population was statistically low compared to today, and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media avaliable, like the internet and television. But, it is not working today. The 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system. ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

(Paragraph 9)

Therefore, this is an obvious majority of citizens who agree with me. The Electoral College is almost universally despised, and not considered the most effective way to elect a President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""

(Paragraph 13)

This is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count. Unless you're in a swing state, your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Every legal American deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true, meaningful vote.

Claims by supporters of the Electoral College are not effective. In fact, one writer finds Swing States to be a good thing! Yes, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign--to really listen to the competing candidates--knowing they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""

(Paragraph 20)

Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election. This writer is implying that the small state votes are useless, and that the voters in them don't even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote! As a former resident of a politically smaller-impact state, I know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting. Putting thought into a vote isn't just a thing people do in large states.

Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.""

(Paragraph 14)

Regards,

A concerned citizen.    ",6,3.0,3.0,,":

53be578,"Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the president(Source 1). This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. Some say the electoral college is good because it prevents ties or because it will make sure there is a winner. But if they can over rule your vote are you really voting for your president? I say the electoral college is a bad system and it needs to be extinguished.

There is no doubt that you should get to decide who your leader will be. And if the electoral college can over rule your vote do you really feel like it's your decision? In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush instead(Source 2). This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn't get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let's get rid of the electoral college!

Some others may say that they support the electoral college because it can't have a tie. ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality ina state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""(Source 3). It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.

""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""(Source 2). This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn't it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each canidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don't get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 ""qualified"" polititians that can over rule the entire country's vote. It's ridiculous how the system works and you are crazy if you support it. I know i want my fair share of input and the electoral college won't allow that.

There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids run-off elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral College...""(Source 3). In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people.

In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.

56e11a2,"Have you ever wanted to know exactly how somone is feeling? What if you were telling your friend a story and you truly wanted to know if they found it interesting? The latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe can detect the emotions of someone by calculating the way the subject's facial structure and muscles form the six basic emotions, which are happiness, surpries, anger, disgust, and fear. This system is called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and can be used for many different reasons. One example is in the cassroom. With the FACS, teachers will be able to read the emotional state of their students, plan/adjust lessons based on the readings, and bring a happier, more interesting experience to the classroom.

The FACS has the ability to read emotions based on muscles and face composition. Tests have been done on one of the most famous paintings in history, ""Mona Lisa"". While this technology can be trivial, as reading a painting-woman's face is not completely productive, it can be helpful towards teachers and students. If the teacher has the ability to truly understand and read their student's emotions, the teacher can switch up and have the ability to try something new. For example, if a student's structure reads that (s)he is confused, the teacher can either go more in depth into the lesson and explain further as to avoid any more confusion. This is exactly what Dr. Huang has predicted, saying that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" in paragraph 6.

Bringing the FACS into the classroom will not only allow teachers to see how bored and confused their students are, it can force the teacher to be innovative and creative in their lesson plans. If the teacher truly cares for their students' attention, (s)he would have to implement new ways to teach boring subjects, in which most students would clock out of otherwise. Most students dread long lectures and usually either stop paying attention, thus wasting both the teacher's and student's time, or forget most of the information. With the FACS, teachers will be able to detect signs of boredom and dread and then capitalize on their emotions with a new activity or fun game to lighten the students' moods, while also giving them the proper amount of information.

Much like the example above, there are ways for teachers to bring a lighter-toned, more fun energy to the classroom with this system. If the teacher sees that the students are boerd, in a lecture for exapmle, the teacher could implement a game or fun activity. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, as explained in paragraph 9, if someone is putting on a happy face, even if they do not mean it, they are subconciously happy and are having a good time. If the students are doing a fun activity together, they are surely going to smile, giving off positive vibes and general happiness in response to an otherwise boring lesson.

The FACS is a revolutionary way of processing emotions and can be really helpful for any student-teahcer learning environment. The system can allow teachers to read what their students are feeling, and can either hcange a lesson plan to reduce confusion, or implement activities or games to increase happiness and positivity during a dreadful lecture. The FACS in the classroom will help both teachers and students alike.",6,3.0,,,":**
