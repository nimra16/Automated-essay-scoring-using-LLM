0047cb3,"""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" stated in

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.

Using means of transportation other than cars, such as walking or biking can release stress and help lower air pollution.

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars states """"When i had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked the verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" This walk allowed her to release stress- versus driving a car could make her more stressed and causes air pollution.

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city;"" from

Paris bans driving due to smog.

If less cars are being used, then there will be less air pollution and cleaner air.

By using other ways of transportation or limiting our use of cars, we can release stress and lower air pollution. Walking, biking, or carpooling are good ways to do so.                     ",2,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

00a541a,"As the author tells in the article, Venus is very dangerous due to thick atmosphere of about ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide that covers venus. Not only is the atmosphere high, but the temperature and atmosphere pressure as well. The temperatures average is over eight-hundred degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is ninety times more than what humans experience on earth.

Althrough, the conditions are extreme. The author gives reasons to visit and research more about Venus. As stated, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author states that they are very amazed how Venus could have been the most similar to Earth. The author continues by describing Venus with similar Earth features, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar fetures such as valley, mountains, ans craters."" Next, the author states that Nasa is already working on making a spacecraft to last long on Venus. As said, "" For example, some simplifield electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Nasa is already planning to visit Venus for research.

Overall, the author supported his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving reasons and telling how Venus could be very similar to a Earth-like planet.

01267d1,"The Face was dicovered on May 24, 2001. It was discovered by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" But the Face is just a natural landform discovered on Mars by NASA.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the face. It was discovered that there was no alien monument. On paragraph seven, the text states, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos....There was no alien monument after all."" This proves that they found out the Face was not an alien monument.

But many people were still not satisfied so, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor went to Mars for a second look. On paragraph ten, the text states, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" On paragraph twelve, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" So, the Face that they found on Mars was just a natural landform after all.

Using evidences from the texts, we learned that the Face was discovered on May 24, 2001. We learned that many people believed it to be an alien monument, but it was not. The Face got looked a second time, on April 8, 2001, but with the camera's absolute ""maximum resolution."" In the end, they found out that the Face was just a natural landform and not an alien monument.

0151c0f,"The so called "" Face'' on mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such thing as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien.

The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slenderman. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them.

The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsence that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true.

My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their back yard that looks a lot like a ground hog. I know that it is not a ground hog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizare story about how in ancient times the ground hog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to.

See? It just doesn't make much sence.

Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous heaad nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!

In conclusion there is no way that the so called face on mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face. ",4,2.0,,":**

01bb07c,"Dear State Senator,

After conducting studies on the American voting system ,I noticed many flaws. Deciding on presidency is one of the most vital processes in any countrie,so it should be addresed properly. the fact that voters vote not for president ,but they vote for slate of electors,the electors can be anyone not holding public office,and the fact that 17 states were never visited during 2000 only focusing on swing states  are just some facts we must look at when deciding a nations fate.

The fact that voters dont vote for president ,but they are actually voting for electors is should be looked into because the people are not  voting for president .The are voting for people to vote for president .which throughly explains the idea that the majority oppinion of the nation is invaluable to the goverment and our society  .This system is not fair .Nor is this system equal. and nor should this system continue to destroy our beloved countrie .

The electors can be anyone not holding public office .This is one of the most gruesome facts about this topic .Bestowing any dreg of society the honor of being an elector is NOT a good idea .This means when one of us votes for an elector trusting him with the fate of the nation. He could mislead us and vote for any canidate making the whole voting system corrupt and misleading.

17 states were unvisited by canidates in 2000. which leads U.S citezens  to ask questions like:Is our oppinion valuable or even considerd valid ? Do the leaders want to run for the benefit of this countrie or do they want POWER?Do our votes even matter or make a diffrence ?Should we just give up on the corrupt system we must live under today?

Thinking about the subject from the prepective of our founding fathers .They would NEVER want a voting system like ours today were people's oppinions dont matter,With often and misleading corrupt electors  not letting the majority rule .This system should be put to an end ,So our countrie can live free again.                                                                    ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument.

01c5e87,"No, i do not agree with America creating ""driverless"" cars . Depending on a machine to navigate the roads and sucessfully take you to your destination is an accident waiting to happen litterally. Who would be at fault if a wreck were to accure? Would you really be able to have piece of mind while letting your car do the driving?

First, you have to think about who would really be at fault if an accident happened. In the article it states that ""if technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" Well it would be challenging to understand that fully, because if something were to happen with one or more sensors malfunctioning, than how can you blame the driver in that case? The maufaturing companies would have to run numerous tests and double check to insure that all of the sensors and gadgets on the vehicle are in working order and stay that way so they deliver a safe product on their part. At the time of the wreck, you will have to take into concideration what each driver was doing, and the steps leading up to the event to come to a conclution of who fault it is.

Secondly, the cars arent 100% driverless, you still have to take over the wheel when need be. When in these cars, the driver has to give his/her full attention at all times, so you might as well be in an ordinary vehicle. A quote from the text states ""their cars have driven more than a million miles without a crash but sofar, Google's cars arent trully driverless; they alert the drivers to take over the when pulling in and out of drive ways or dealing with complicated issues, such as navagating through road work or accidents."" Having to take over when their is a contruction zone or driveways etc, is not the deffinition of a full driverless car to me.

lastly, the cars have fancy sensors and other tools and whatnot , but these cars still call for human skills. Driverless cars are intelligent but may not be able manage a situation if you were to look down at your phone quickly or something else along the lines of that. The information states that ""they can steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. You have to stay focused on the road and guide the car if needed in a situation. if you want to not stay locked on the road and do another thing while in the car, these vehicles are not for you.

In conclusion, i do not approve of these inventions until it is proved that they are 100% safe and until you dont have to pay attention to driving the whole time. Driverless cars still need the skill of a human behind the wheel, they arent fully driverless and something may not work in proper order, and also you have to think about who would be at fault if a wreck happened. These are all things we need to take into concideration before going out and purchasing one of these new vehicles.

01dabde,"Work. School. Party. No matter what you have on your to do list you still have to get there, so why are car sales going down and how is it benificial to our society? Teens and young adults can often be heard discussing what brand of car they one day hope to buy and all the modifications they will make to 'trick it out'. Many people though end up being 20 or older before they actually get that car they always talked about, and despite parents claim of laziness there could be more to it then that. So what advantages could there be to a  world with fewer cars on the road?

The first topic that is at the forfront of the minds of most people just starting out their new life is cost. The world revolves around money, thats just the way it is, so many people are finding themselves cutting out things that they don't really need. Now I know what your thinking but before you begin your argument that you really need that blue mercedes you saw in the magazine think about just how much that cost compared to your last paycheck, not so exiting anymore right? With public transportation becomingh more and more avalible many people are choosing to take the public bus rather then buy their own car. Another thought is all those taxes you pay. What you thought they went to police and teacher's wages and building nice little parks for the kiddies? Well acording the Environmantal Protection Agency 80% goes into making Highways and other transport, and why do they need that much money? Because we drive 100 tons over them every day. Many of the more polluted citys are even begining to put laws into place banning or restricting traffic in some areas and placing fines on those who violate them. Between the purchase price and matnence as well as gas and the money used to fund roads and highways theres a lot of dough pouring into your car drives.

Now heres the topic I know your all tired of hearing about but its still very important, the environment. Car emmisions are the second biggest source of polllution in the atmosphere, first place going to powerplants and third place being cows, yes cows. Is a world blanketed in smog and smoke where the very air that sustains you is poison the kind of place you want to live in or, for that matter, raise kids in? Its not the the planets health we're talking about here its the health of everything living on it including us. While we're on the topic of health one of the greatest health issues in America is obesity, now imagine if everyone left their cars at home and walked or biked instead, the whole country would be healthier then ever before. And you know how when you go into the country the air smells so nice and clean, well that could be the city too if we just cut back on emmisions, we could have nice fresh air as well. Now think of your children, or friends or even yourself, just outside playing football when a car comes by and almost hits you, dozens of people die every day in car crashes that wouldnt if there were less cars on the road. So think of the health of your familly, your friends, your pets, and yourself.

Finally we have the cultural shift, many Americans are already choosing to carpool take public transport or even just walk and less and less are buying cars. This trend is so noticibly prominent that car companys are trying to come up with new ideas and products to keep their customers coming. Citys are coming up with new systems of bike and car borrowing as well as a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and imporve safty"". So for those of you that can't stand to be left behind by the times jump on the band wagon and you can do your part to bring about a new cleaner era in the world.

Cars, the parasprites of a modern age, keep multiplying and destroying more and more. The emmisions given of by these monstrosities will linger more many a milenia poisoning the air we breath and devastating the world out children will inherit. Unless we do something to stop it now this travesty will continue to ravange all life on the planet untill we are on the brink of extinction, so do us all a favor and help to push this new trend of a car free world.

Goodmoring senator before I start , I would like to ask how are you doing and how's your family. I hope everybody health is great and family problems. Today I want to talk to you about some little problem that's not going as well as I thought it was going to go. Electoral College is not a good idea for us citizens. Because everybody in this country that works and come from another country , should be able to vote for their President. The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? The presidential election most have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.

According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was  the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Also  voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!

In conclusion, The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism , a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. This is all I wanted to tell you , I hope you listen to what I'm trying to tell you. I know I am not the only one that thinks like this. If you would like to contact me back you could email me at EMAIL_ADDRESS. Thankyou and have a great day!

022a010,"I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be slightly helpful, but other than that, not at all. While few would benefit from being taught by a computer, others, not so much.

Dr. Huang said that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I believe this is wrong, as there is no way of making a student less bored. If you were to add entertainment to the mix of the lesson, then how could the lesson be taken seriously? Teachers tend to add their own spice to lessons that, both, make the students laugh, and become more interested in the lesson. No computer could mimick a human's humor. A computer also would not be able to explain things as well as a teacher could. A computer could modify the lesson as many times as it could, but the student would still be confused. A teacher would be able to explain things better and make it simpler than a computer could. It would also be quicker.

It is proven that students learn better with paper and a physical learning environment. Sure, a computer would know more and be able to explain things more properly, but knowing this fact... Would it even be worth teaching the student if they won't even remember it? Technology would also completely replace the need to write down notes by hand. With a physical environment, you also learn life skills. For example, knowing when to speak and ask questions, manners, and getting along and working with others. These skills are often used in work environments.

And, what about those who have no access to technology? Poverty and homelessness are still big in the world. Sure, your child could participate in a physical environment at a school, but why would there be a need for schools if it is all on the computer? It would also be cheaper for school officials to have computers than to have teachers that require a weekly or monthly pay, and to not require supplies for the children as well. It would quickly spiral into a ""be rich or be homeless"" world in an instant. A lot of stress would be put on the backs of many people who wish for their child to get an education. We already give these people a hard time, why given them an even harder time, and even include their children?

In conclusion, a lot would be wrong with using the Facial Action Coding System in schools. Very few would benefit from having such advanced technology instead of teachers and a physical environment, but the rest would be disadvantaged.",5,3.0,,":** The essay presents a clear point of view on the issue, arguing that the Facial Action Coding System would not be beneficial in schools.

02ab5d2,"One car, one life, one big accident. That is all the future is asking to develope by continuing to try to improve and inspire people to use ""driverless cars"". I do not think driverless cars should ever become a new big thing for many reasons. They can malfunction on you. They still need assestence if they cant handle a road situation. They might not update any new laws or road changes nearby. There is so many negative reasons and thoughts that appear when thinking about the development of driverless cars.

My first reason to why I am against driverless cars is because they can always malfunction. What if it doesnt see an animal in the road and runs it over will it stop to help, would it starting loosing control? Who knows because your not the one behind the wheel. You could have stopped and saved that poor animal, instead you let your car take control. Also what if it just shuts down? Turns off completely in the middle of the road. All electronics have a point in time where they are slow and slowly begin to shut down. How long would you have the car to keep? Do you think a driverless car can last you up to 10 years? Maybe if your lucky. The weather and the technology cant keep up and hold its together as long as a gas opperated automobile is. What if it doesnt let you take control because it malfunctions and you end up hurting someone? Like it says in the text ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture?

Also, what even is the point to have an automotive that still needs you in the car. If its not smart enough to drive without needing your assistence it would be useless. So say you are driving down the street and your texting and letting you car drive on its own. All of a sudden it crashes and hurts other including yourself. It would still be your fault even though you was not the one driving. In other words if you get in a car accident would the police put your car in jail or you? Well you offcorse if your even recovered from the crash your car has put you in anyways. Driverless cars allows drivers to think they can keep their eyes off the road when all reality they have to pay attention and be alert. If you have to have your eyes remained on the roads at all times then you might as well drive, atleast you will be secure and more alert.

Finally the car over all is just a big mimic. People are tying to develope objects with human like qualities. In the text it even says ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" Personally I believe being human is special and an automobile can never be as special as a human life. Yes we may love our cars but never as much as one would love there children, friends, or family.

Driverless cars are just an overall bad idea and we should keep our state safe and the people in it. I'm not the only one who agrees. Driverless cars are illegal in most states. In the text it mentions ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" This shows that im not the only one who belives they are not safe and no matter what upgrades and assumptions that are made will not make a driverless car a good idea. Lets be original and stick to the safe way lets avoid the one car, one life, one accident.              ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view against driverless cars and provides some reasons to support this view.

02d481d,"Dear, Senator

The

Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.

Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people . Also, the electoral college causes many issues duing the voting period.

To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year.

You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford Plumer states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Plumer Paragraph 10) What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose

HILARY CLINTON!

Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.

If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people.

Furthermore, the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system ae wrong"" Bradford explains ""Back in 1960, Segregationists in the Louisinna legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.

The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote.

Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time,

People would be let down when they find out that  the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.

Bradford proves this by explaining ""...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Plumer Paragraph 11) On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Richard A. Posner exclaims ""The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner Paragraph 15) What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.

Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.

On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example,

The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the ""Winner-take-all"" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.

However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.

There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons

NOT

to keep the electoral college in use.

Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they  might have as their new president.

According to Bradford, the electoral college is ""...Unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer paragraph 14) It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.    ",6,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue of the electoral college, arguing that it is outdated and should be replaced with popular vote.

All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

"" As an official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg is a credible source for information regarding transportation in America. However there are places all around the world were automobiles are causing problems. Limiting car usage could help solve many of those issues.

In America, the topic of alternative transportation has been  discussed many times, but in previous bills, 80% of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport. This can be found in paragraph 9 of the first source as the fifth line. Sadly America is not the only country having problems. In

Paris, France , diesel cars make up 67% of the vehicles and the diesel feul is blamed for the smog accumulation in the city. In Paris, A warmer layer of air caused by cold nights and warm days, trapped the car emissions which then caused a five day period of intensifying smog. France's smog build-up rivaled that of

Beijing, China , which is claimed to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. This problem also exists in the States, as transportation is the second largest cause of America's emissions, right behind power plants. To ensure safety anyone who was still driving their car was fined 22- euros or $31.

Bogota, Columbia followed France in their violation fee and charged any violater $25. Bogota has created a

Day Without Cars , in which no cars are used, to promote alternative transport and the reduction of smog levels. Another positive effect no cars can have would be a more peaceful enviroment, as stated in sources 1 and 3. In America, recent studies show that Americans have been buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Although it may be far in the future, America may soon follow the lead of

Vauban, Germany , where it is completely car-free. This probably won't happen anytime in the near future, but the use of automobiles has gone down in the United States. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor company, proposed a city in which, pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, etc. are used to save time, lower emissions and improve safety. He sees this future, hopefully others will too.

Although America might not be exactly like Vauban, it is good to hope that it will get there someday. No cars would result in a calmer atmosphere and a more peaceful lifestyle. Also, it would lower the emissions made by vehicles, which in turn would save the atmosphere, thus saving life on earth. No cars would also help improve safety, both of animals and of people. We may not be completely there yet, but the world will someday have no need for cars and that will be the first step into the future.

03e804e,"Car free cities, in German suburb life goes on without cars. The residents of the community have given up their cars.  Street parkings and driveways are forbidden in the new district near the French and swiss borders. the streets are completely empty except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on the edge of the community. In addition, 70% of vaubans families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. A growing trend going around they say they want to seperate them from auto use, a saying called ""smart planning"". the efforts that they put in that some people build their own houses to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions from tailpipes. In Europe they are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United states.

In conclusion, there have been effortsain the past two decades to make the cities more dense, and better for walking. Home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, this may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. above all this, stores are placed on about a walk away, on a main street rather then along some distant highway. According to them how much you drive is as important as weather you have a hybrid.

042167f,"In Europe, a new trend has started. Many towns have banned the ownership of cars. One town that this happened in is Vauban, Germany. In this town, citizens are living lives without a lot of stress. They enjoy riding tandem bikes with their wives and walking alone. In Paris, the act has been picked up. Since it's so popular, Paris streets hold many cars. Now that the temporary law has passed, the amount of smog has dropped dramaticaly.

When cars aren't used, lives are saved. Car accidents happen very often and oftentimes they are fatal. When you have a car, you become able to get a DUI. Owning a car can bring you extensive fines, even when you make a small accident in a fraction of a second.

With the economy the way it is, who can even afford a nice car? Bikes are much cheaper and safer for people as well as the environment. If everyone in the world stopped using their cars for a month, we might be able to save a species from dying out, or maybe slow the desintegration of the ozone layer. In Yosemite, wolves flee from the roads because of the massive amount of death it causes their species.

Suburban cities are working on making everything walking distance. On the weekends, public transportation is free. If you have an electric car or you're carpooling three or more people, you're allowed to drive in these cities. Because of these new laws that are being tested in certain areas, many people don't have their licenses. Many teenagers today aren't concerned with being able to drive, and many adults live close enough to their workplace to walk there. Although the laws restricting driving can seem very restricting, they will save lives and will give society a chance to have a smarter, cleaner, and safer future.         ",2,4.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 4**

045c7fb,"Bases on the passage I think it would be a good idea to have technology read your emotional expressions in the classroom. Then again students in the class room might not be okay with it. For example,if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad might follow,and it can tell if your becoming confused or bored. Some of they reasons of why Eckon created the new technology might be a little to much of the kids that rather look at the walls and be bored.

In order to get students to want theis new technology, we need to make the school and the creator find more ways to get them to understand why we need it. Make them understand why we feel that we need it. Also give them reasons on why we feel it should be valuable. And what can happen if we did have this type of technolgy.

Since we live in a digital world i feel that people and the students do not really understand why it could be okay to hvae new technology to read your emotional expressions. I think we need this techology for more then one reason. We need this technology because lots of kid go home complaing about why they are stressing so bad. They also got home complaing about being bullied abd not ahve enough time to do their home. And i know teacher now these days try to find better ways to make kids not go home complaing about anything,because there are better ways to get through the problem.

I honestly think that if we did have this new technology to read kids emotioal expressions when would not have as much problems like we do now. It's not bad to try something new for once. Just think about how do you think teachers our school feel when were not paying attention to anything they be talking about. Or how they ask us a question and we have no idea what in the world is going on. Having tchnology would be great for our school,and for our teachers,because they need to know how we feel about they lesson were working on. Teachers also need to know how much kids know.

Having technology that could read your emotional expression would be a big deal. At least for meand the teachers I think,because for me I honeslty sometimes have no idea what in the world be going on when the teacher is talking the same time when i'm trying to get it in my head or understand it my self. Come on now the technology can help you in school. Why not try to have something helpful for you and for your teachers,let along your parnters also. I know yout parents get tried of you kids coming home complaing about how you have so much homework and how you have time to get any of it done. Well here's some help since you students talk about having so much home,not being able to get it done on time,and being bullied at school. Put your phone down and put your head in some books. I bet if you put your head in somes books then you won't be complaing about having some much homework,not being able to get it done on time,and be bullied everyday. Cell phone usage does cause drama and emotional problems. Technolgy to read students emotional expressions would be the best idea in the world to read students emotional expressions,because some kids need it. Even if they feel like they don't, i bet you they do. Not just for the teachers but for the parnters and theirsleves to.                  ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument.

The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheel and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone Fuyrther improvemenrts in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more druvung takse on theri own.

04af97d,"Driverless should not be used under any condition. Driverless cars are careless, imperfected, and unreliable. We should never risk ourselves or others just because we are lazy and dont wanna drive. If we left everything to these driverless cars many pepole could die. Driverless cars should not be allowed on the streets.

To begin, Driverless are carless. Driverless cars can not stay allert like a human can. In the passage it states, ""They can steer, accerlate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". This shows that a Driverless cars just does not have what it takes to be out on the road. If a kid ran in the middle of the street, unsuspectingly, the car would not have time for the human to take over and the kid would be severly injured or worse. It just is not worth the risk.

In addition, Driverless cars are not advanced enough. Driverless cars may have sensors and take extra steps in safty but technology just is not there. The pasage says, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"". In the future we may have the power we need to have driverless cars, but in this time now we do not. Many states even have laws that will not allow driverless cars to even be tested in that states.

Finally, They are not reliable. All technology has flaws and that can not be helped. The passage even states, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver ot the owner?"". This is a good point, The car technology may seem flawless, but many factors come into play with something this big. The car may have a maulfunction that no one could have predicted, and many pepole could be injured or killed. This driverless car just is not reliable enough to risk the lives of innocent.

Driverless cars are a very nice idea and would be helpful, However driverless cars just are not safe. These driverless cars are careless, imperfected, and unreliable. Many factors play in even ones we can not fully predict when it comes to technology. Its not worth the risk of pepole getting hurt just because we get lazy and do not want to drive.

05592d5,"People over the years that have been talking about cars that drive themselves have found this topic very interesting because of the phrase"" Cars that drive themselves"". Yes it sounds interesting and very cool and far into the future but there are downsides to this idea and there are some good sides. It depends on the people that you ask because some could say oh no way! Then there are some that could say oh yes way! Then you have to think of it this way, are these futuristic cars even safe for humans to be in?

Driverless cars do sound really cool to me because then you don't really need to do anything but sit back and watch. Then again I just don't think that I would want a car that drives itself only because of the dangers it kind of puts you in. For example, in the passage it states that these cars have all of these sensors on it that can keep you safe while you're driving it, well what do you do if while that car is driving and one of the sensors malfunctions and there is a car running a stop sign while it's your turn to go what do you do? You won't even see the car coming from the side of you and that sensor malfunctioned so it can't alert the car then you get smacked into by the other vehicle. These cars do come with very dangerous factors and possibilities that can happen at any given moment. So yes these cars are cool but I would never get one for myself.

In paragraph two when it talks about how television and movies have been fascinated with cars that drive themselves, I think it can be a bad thing for them doing that. That's because the way movies and TV portray the driverless cars is so unreal but others who don't understand that well, they could be in a good amount of danger. For example in the movie Transformers, every single one of those cars drive themselves. They steer themselves, they can open their own doors, they can do all of this stuff and someone who actually believes that that is what these manufacturers are coming out with, then they are wrong because they think that it will be able to do that stuff and while they're distracted BOOM! They just got t- boned by another driver because the person wasn't paying attention. These cars could really cause a lot of danger to society.

Driverless cars are way too dangerous to me, I feel like people would be irrisponsible with them and cause harm to the community. I'm against cars that drive themselves for right now until they can proove to me that these cars are 100% safe. Like we all know today there are crazy drivers out thtere and with them on the road with a car like this, that could put a ton of people in danger. To help prove my whole point in paragraph 9 it says that ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer""? Well here is the thing, it said if the technology fails. That means that there is a chance of the technology failing and causing harm, just like a lot of other technology can do. For example, some sort of saw to cut wood or metal. If one of those things malfunctions and a blade goes flying it could hit someone and easily kill them. Not all technology is 100% fool proof so that is why I wouldn't trust this driverless car.

So once again I do not support the creation of one of these driverless vehicles because of a safety issue. Even if this car does have all of these sensors on it that doesn't mean that it is totally safe because you still have all of these other crazy drivers on the road that could potentially smack into if they aren't paying attention or even if you aren't paying attention. Yes in the movies these cars do look really cool but I don't think that they need to be created and brought into real life. I say that we just stick to what we already do. That's having actual people drive the car instead of having a computer programmed into the car driving it. Now I know people don't drive 100% either but what if the technology fails and someone dies in a crash? Then what do you do? You definitely can't blame the person for something that a company made malfunctioning. We the people just need to stop and think about what all could happen if you let a computer drive your two to three ton vehicle.                          ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of driverless cars, arguing that they are too dangerous to be allowed on the road.

Now exist a new system that can recognize the emotions, thsi new innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckham Institute with collaboration prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam, they are experts at developing better ways for Humans and computers to communicate, this actually is not like math homework when we can calculate.

Then, Dr Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr Pail Eckman creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System).

In fact,we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day, so, you can probablly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

060a4e7,"In the passage the Author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit desite the dangers it presents. In the first paragraph the author says ¨Venus, sometimes called the Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.¨. In that quote it is saying that the Evening star is so bright that someone is not really paying attention could see it because it is so bright it can not be missed. It is also saying that it is one of the brightest points of light which means if you are lost you could look up and hopefully see that star and it will give you some light to find your way. Another quote from paragraph one is ¨However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun¨. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it. In paragraph two it says ¨Often referred to as Earths ¨twin¨, Venus is the closest planet to earth in tearms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance to earth¨. In that quote it is saying that Venus is known as Earths twin because of the size. The Earth and Venus are about the same size. It also says that Earth and Venus have about the same density as each other. In my opinion I think that the planets should all be different sizes and densities because of the fact that everything is different. When it comes to planets they should all be different sizes, so that people can easily point out the planets and be able to name them easily and not get them mixed up because of them looking the same size in the atomosphere. In the passage in paragraph three it says ¨A think atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankes Venus¨. In this quote it states that most of Venus is covered in carbon dioxide. If scientists wanted to go study Venus they would have to have many layers of protection on because carbon doxide can be very harmful to the human body. Especially since the carbon dioxide percentage is so high it can extrmely hurt the human body of anyone that goes to Venus to study it. My thoughts on this topic are that if they want to study it they should send up a professional to put something on Venus that can dectect any movement or anything on the planet. They should do that so the scientists wanting to study Venus can study it from a safe distance and out of harms way.",1,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue, but it does so inconsistently and uses inadequate examples and evidence to support its position.

06e2db4,"For years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the ""heart"", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students.

When eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, ""Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk.

The first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the ""your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger""(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'""(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students.

As more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a ""I do not want to be here"" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students.

Although this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom.

07a14a5,"The author's claim of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is closely related to Earth, Venus has a enviroment that is similar to Earth, and scientists want to explore more of what Venus has to offer.

The first claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that Venus is closely related to Earth. In the passage, it states,"" Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars our other planetary neighbors orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner, in space terms, humans have sent numerous to land on this cloud draped world. Each precious mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us"" (Paragraph 2). This supports the author's claim because the author believes that scientists should study Venus because Venus is closely related to Earth.

The second claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that Venus has a similar enviroment to Earth. In the passage, it states,"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (Paragraph 3). This supports the author's claim because there are many physical and enviromental dangers that are present on Venus. Despite all of Venus's dangers, scientists still want to explore Venus in depth.

The third claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that the author supports the further exploration of Venus by scientists. In the passage it states,"" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option to visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?. NASA has one particulary conpelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vechile hovering over Venus would aviod the unfrendily ground conditions by staying up and out of thier way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy, conditions, but survivable for humans."" (Paragraph 4 and 5). This supports the author's claim because scientists want to know more about Venus's planatery history and similarities to Earth.This statement also supports the author's claim because the scientists wants to try and send humans to Venus.

Therefore, the author's claim supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by Venus being closely related to Earth, Venus has a similar enviorment to Earth, and the author encouriging further explorations to Venus.       ",6,4.0,,"**

07cde52,"My argument for the development of these cars is against it because i do not agree with some stuff such as the cars driving its self.

If a car drives it's self then it would be no fun for people who have cars. This development is crazy because it will change many things. We should keep cars the way they are instead of changing them to something different that not everyone would like.

Many cars are already having many problems so why make a car that can drive its self? We should fix the problems in todays cars instead of worrying about trying to bring something new. People are putting to much in cars, such as sensors and computer hardware. These things might help but they could also fail at any time and turn into a bad situation. However it could be a good idea to always add safety things to the car, but not everything can be sure to always work. Anything can fail at anytime.

Technology is really advanced! Everyday people are working on something new because of how well technology is. If technology keeps on advanving people will make more things and come out with incredible things. Many of these things won't be safe. People have to think in the safety of theres and others. It is not a great idea If you let a car do everything for you because that could be dangerous. You should be able to control the car whenever you want . Imagine if you come to a stop sign and the car doesn't stop? that could seriously cause a problem. Somebody could get hit and that will not turn out good.

Other cars like BMW's and Gm have developed mny different things for cars. In the article for example says a BMW has a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" whitch means the car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph. What if the car was to stop working and keep going and not being able to stop? what would happen ? Nothing good would. GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. What if you trust this vibrator and you wait till it vibrates to stop backing up and the vibrator fails and you hit something? that could be dangerous. You could back into a kid or person and run them over. You could also hit an object and damage your car. That's why i am stating my opinion on why i am against the development of these cars. We should stay with what we have until we are 100% sure about things. ",4,2.0,,":**

07d41ed,"The use of the Facial Action Conding System would be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom because it will detect how the student feels about the task at hand. If it detects that the student is bored it could modify the lesson to make them more awake and begin working on the task at hand. This technology could also help find each students way of learning. For example if one student works hands on and another works by taking notes then the system can mofify both programs to fit their learning style. This technology also could help teachers see if a student understands a topic, and if they see they don't or they are becoming frustrated with it they can modify the lesson. Using this system would be of value to students and schools, because it not only would help students learn but it would also help teacher teach.

If a student is feeling bored with his or her work the Facial Ation Coding System can modify the task at hand and make the student more prone to continue and finish the work. This claim is supported by the article because it says ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" This would help the teacher help the student make changes. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This technology not only helps students become more inclined in school work but it also helps teachers

This technology could help find each students way of learning by detecting each facial expression to see if they are inclined in the task at hand. For example, if one student is understanding and enjoying the way a lesson is being taught, the system could modify each of their lessons to fit their way of learning. But if another student doesn't like the way a lesson is being taught the system can test out different styles until the correct one is found. The article supports this by stating ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar as might follow."" This example could go for both advertisment and school work. ""If you frown, the next ad will be different."" This system can be used to see if a student is enjoying and understanding a lesson as well as not enjoying and understanding a lesson.

The Facial Action Coding System could help teachers see if a student is understanding a topic or lesson. It could do this by detecting their facial expression then letting the teacher know if changes need to be made. This would help because it allows the teacher to know if thier methods of teaching are acually being of value to the student. This claim is supported because the article includes ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This supports the claim because it shows that the software can identify not only one emotion but serveral. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The technology can analize and detect certain emotions and allow the teacher to see all of them and make modifcations if they are needed.

Using this system would be a value to schools because it not only helps students learn but it would help teachers teach. It would allow teachers to see how certain kids learn and modify their lessons to fit. It would also allow students to be more inclined in the task at hand. This system would be a great value to education and how kis are taught.         ",6,4.0,,"**

08cdf6e,"We all hide our emotions at one point or another but, what if we had the technology that could detect whatever were feeling despite if were trying to hold them in or not. The Facial Action Coding System or FACS is just that piece of technolgy that is capable of detecting any given emotion. Dr. Huang inventor of this software has even modified it to were it can find out any emotion or emotions all at once. It's been questioned should this kind of technolgy be used in classrooms for students. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in the classroom because, if any student is having troubles on the actvity at hand the Facial Action Coding System could detect that modify the prompt and make it easier for the student to then understand. Second, this software could help you better understand someone and their well-being being able to see exactly what's making them happy and what's making them upset. Third, it's better way for human and computers to ""communicate or interact"".

Anybody couldn't say that they haven't had problems understanding something at any given point in time. Simpily because, everyone can't understand everything right away with no problem/obstacle getting in the way weither it being how the words are phrased or if the vocabulary is too hard to comprehend. FACS could solve this issue right away. As presented in the passage ""Dr. Huang predicts, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" therefore making it easier for the student or user to understand what is being asked or written. Solving probems much quicker than the instrustor could explaining the information piece by piece.

Understanding emotions when communicating with someone is key. Yet, we might not recognize all that are being distrubed to us. Another great reason for FACS to come into play. As stated in the passage ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This is all very true we can't comprehend every emotion that's more dull or hidden. So why don't we get a little help at recognizing more emotions. With FACS we can better understand someones true feelings inside and their well-being. This can than lead to possibly help solving some of the persons unsolved issues and other ""troubling thoughts."" Helping them become of the better verison of themselves.

In our generation today technolgy is something that we live and breath. It's important that we become familair with technolgy and being able to use it properly and effectifly. ""Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate."" Now isn't this perfect? Huang can help us better understand computers and help computers better understand us. If students will be using computers 24/7 why not have the proper setup for them. If the software gets used in the way it's meant to it can overall have a positive effect towards the situation. After some time the computer can develop how the student or user works and operates and what they can understand and can not. Having a large postitive impact. Greater increasing the student's grades, confidence, and potentional in class. Allowing them to fully understand the content be covered better than they would ever before.

In conculsion, the Facial Action Coding System or FACS is valuable in the students classroom because, it can modify the content of the information to be better understood. Being able to see and recognize more emotions for peers. Lastly it can help the user better ""communicate"" with the computer.

08f5a36,"Driverless cars, although dangerous in a multitude of ways, have uses that far excede any dangers. It is said that in order to progress in life you must first take steps back. Although these driverless cars are a step forward in technology, they can be seen as a being a step backward because of the dangers that persist. In reality, these dangers are just a learning curve to arguably one of the most revolutionary inventions in the last decade, driverless cars. These cars are very fesable because they are sought after, the technology is available, and they are getting safer with time.

These driveress cars are some of the most sought after technology that has entered this world. The human has drempt of the flying car for generations, and finaly the idea is fesable. The text referances Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and how he ""envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system,"" (Paragraph 1). Although this is just the dream of one man, millions more people believe that driverless cars are the key to the future. These millions of other people have drempt for driverless cars, and many times their fathers did also. Knowing this, many people will want to get their hands on this new technology that is a driverless car. Making the development of these cars very positive becasue the population will want and has wanted driverless cars for decades. Driverless cars have been a thing of fiction for so many people for so long, but now these cars are a reality.

Not only are they sought after by millions, but the technology for these driverless cars is available and has been available. Driverless cars were always thought to be a thing of the past, but the reality is that they are a thing of the present and have been for many years. The writing points out that, "" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (Paragraph 2). While many people view driverless cars as a thing of the future, Google has formed them to be a thing of the now. This technology, that has been sought after for generations, is now readaly available. It was even said that Tesla has released plans to come out with a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time in 2016. (Paragraph 10). Knowing that these cars are being released this year is over the top of many peoples head, and shows that the development of these cars is indeed helpful. Knowing that the technology is already out in the world shows that the development of these cars grow every single day. This growth will positivly effect the automotive industry, and keep the people making these cars coming out with new and safe versions of these driverless cars.

The one thing that people can control about these cars is their safety. This safety is both for the environment, and most importantly for the drivers of these cars. Indeed, these cars are as safe as they ever will be. We are reminded of the safety of these cars when paragraph eight reminds us that, ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a saftey feature, and saftey is a big concern,"" Not only is the in-car heads-up display a safty feature as it talks about, but reminds us that saftey is the biggest concern that the companies have. This paragraph even mentions how some of the ""fun"" features are for the saftey of the driver, mainly to keep them awake and alert at the wheel even if they are not the drivers. Knowing that saftey is one of the bigest concerns that the companies have for these cars sould be settling because consumers know that the automated cars that they buy would be in top conditions and have a multitude of features that keep both themselves and the passangers safe. One of the many features mentioned was the voice or even a vibrating chair to signal when the car needs a human to control the driving because the road needs the expertise of a human driver. Because these cars are safe, their development is very positive.

The development of these driverless cars should be continued because they are sought after by many people, the technology is available and is being worked on, and these cars are safe and getting safer. By developing these tests, the companies are creating a technology that, to millions of people, is still only a dream. The complications that these cars may have is a minute detail in the ever evolving spectrum that is the saftey of these cars for the people inside an out. Driverless cars are no longer a thing of the future but make up our present in every way imaginable.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates some critical thinking, but it does so inconsistently and uses inadequate examples and evidence to support its position.

08fb0fb,"I am Luke Bomberger and I just graduated from High school and had two part time jobs. One was at the bank and another at the grocery store. One day my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to go to Euroope on a cattle boat, and I could not resit it.

It was 1945 and World War two had just ended and the UNRRA joined together and helped the coutries to recover from the war. UNNRA hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the cattle that were shipped over seas. Don and I signed up to do this position. In August we got orders to go to New Orleans. I had 335 horses that I had to take care of.

After about two weeks we finally arrived, but caring for the animals kept me busy.

They had to be fed and watered at least two or three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be dragged from the lower holds of the ship and the stalls had to be cleaned out. I had helped out at my aunt? farm when I was younger but I was not prepared for the dangers on the sea. On my second trip I was going to go make my hourly report to the captain and I slid down a slippery ladder. A small metal strip had stopped me from going into the dark atlantic, but I was not able to work for a couple days because my ribs were cracked.

This job kept me very busy, and had many oppertunities to see things I have never seen before. I halso had found some times that I could have fun on board instead of having to care for the animals. After the animals would be dropped off we would head back. We played all kinds of activites and games. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball in empty places were the animals were. We also had table-tennis tournoments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, the games had help pass time.

I encourage ever teenager if you have an opputunity, to sign up for this job. This job I was able to see things I had never seen, it was a lifetime experience, and I was able to stay busy with the animals and then have a little fun. I encourage this job because this is what I did it was an enjoyable jod. I mean how cool is it to ride a ship and take care of cattle. Then after they get unloaded you can even have some fun on the ship. It helped me become more aware of other countries and their needs.   ",2,4.0,,,"**

08fbb47,"Is it possible to be too passionte about something? This author wrote an entire article on how challenging but worth it, it would be to visit Venus' crtiical atmosphere. How well does the author describe, or explain, their own opinion? They support this idea very thoroughly by these three things: The idea that life could have lived there before, the conditions are inhumane, and the fact that it could gain insight and can settle our curiosity.

To start, the idea that at one point in time there has acutally been life living on that planet is crazy. In paragraph four, it talks about how at on point there may have been big oceans like that are similar to the ones on earth. We think this because there are many rocky surfaces, such as valleys, mountains, and craters, that can only be formed from water eriodication. When you even look at it, it just look earth like. Obviously it has changed over the years but you can't rule it out. Is it possible there were living things on this planet at once?

Secondly, now the conditions are inhumane. How did they get that way? Paragprah three is all about what it is like on Venus. The temperatures now rise over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The air is absolutely unbreathable as it is made up of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide. Not only is there carbon dioxide floating around in the air, the atmosphere is mostly made up of sulfuric acid which is very toxic to be breathing in that much. The air pressure on Venus is ninety times deeper, or stronger, than the bottom of sea level. If we even tried ot land on Venus none of the metals would last in eight-hindred degrees. There are also many impediments such as erupting volacnos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting. Minus all these problems we would have to find a way around, the author believes that it is still worth it to visit Venus.

Lastly, we would gain so much insight and our curioustiy could be settled. Paragraph eight talks all about this and about how this could open the doors for us to learn new ideas and come up with new technology that could even help up here on Earth. They also state in paragraph eight to support the idea that despite Venus' risky conditions it would still make a worthy pursuit by saying, and I qoute, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Which I interpret as do not let these conditions scare us. We are so smart and we can be creative and find a way around all of these 'problems'.

In conclusion, how opinionated and factual can someone be? How do you know to balance these two things? At times we have to be one-hundred percent curious about what we are writing about because you don't want to write an article on something you don't care about or find important.

0906ee2,"Your feeling ten percent annoyed, fifty percent boared, and thirty percent suprised. Advancements in technology has been brought to an entire new era with facial readers. One computer can tell people how they feel about themselves just by the muscel structure and movements in their face. Who would not want to know what some stranger walking down the street is feeling? I mean, I know I would. Today our generation is amoung the nosiest. Classrooms today need these computers to better understand their class. Emotional expressions can change society by understanding children, making lives easier, and progressing technology.

Children have mood changes as fast as people chose fast food over vegtables. Children are a hard age to understand what they are feeling, becuase they are so quick at changing the things they are doing and always moving. Having a brain wired to becoming board with something one day and then wanting to do it again the nest day. That is hard for teachers to keep up with. Dr. Huang commented, ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or board."" But, with having a computer that classifies the six basic emotions and picks up each one takes a great stress off of teachers. Teachers have a class from anywhere to ten to fourty students. Having to know each one personally and be able to read what they are thinking to help further their education is a big task for underpaid teachers to do. Those fourty students have all different facial structures and the Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track their movements and weight the different units. Teachers understanding their students better with the Coding System, will help them further their education in a classroom when seeing if they are frustrated or upset.

Fourty students, fourty diiferent views, and fourty different emotions. That is a lot to take in. Having the Coding System in your classroom takes the relief off the teachers of figuring out each student. With the easy three step process anyone can read their emotions, but just by video it makes it three steps easier. With no wires and personal information to plug in. Teachers have students that do not like to share their feelings, which takes a lot of time for the teacher to understand what they are feeling taking away from other students. Dr. Huang stated, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Saving the time of teachers and peronalizing lessons for the class creates so many benefits. Not having this machine will not do damage in hurting the students, it is helping them.

Fifty years ago classrooms did not even have a smart board or computer labs, they had chalk boards. It is a fact some people do not like change. Parents probably did not like their children learning how to use computers or new technology. But our world is advacing, and makes it that much amazing to see how simply technology is helping change classrooms for the better. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are developing ways for us and computers to communicate. People think that is scary and weird. The fact is, we can learn about the artwork from hundreds of years ago with the sytem. Classrooms can have precise and exact answers with the system. Huang used Mona Lisa and they figured out that she was 83 percent happy, and 9 percent disguested. Can your art teacher tell you that?

Technology is helping further our classrooms education and learn abilites.

Classrooms benefit from the Facial Coding System. Many people will be against this new change, but they have no arguement. The Facial Action Coding System is easy, helpful, and dependable. As a teacher I would feel more comfortable with giving a lesson and teaching views ,they all understood and agreed with. Lives can change by understanding childrens minds, creating hard ache free lives, and keeping up with the new technology.

0980c17,"Dear Senator,

While it is unfair, the Electoral College should still be used. There are some problems with the way it works, but it would still be easier than having presidential elections by popular vote.

One of the reasons why the Electoral College should still be used is the certainty of the outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - 538 - is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.

Secondly, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

At the most basic level, however, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Aside from it being a little unfair, the Electoral College does its best to elect a President, which is why it should still be kept.

09a62eb,"Driverless cars are an advance in technology, even though they are not fully self automatic yet .Driverless cars may not be fully driverless yet but in the future it is possible. Even if people dont like the idea of it its still going to happen. Driverless cars are not going to be any good for our generation.

Driving is something that you will need your full attention for even if the car is self driven it can still screw up. I don't personally see the point of somthing that is not going to help anyone. Chances are that there will be more accidents and more people will be injured or even die because all technology malfunctions at one point or another and there is no stopping that. Technology is a good thing when it is helping people. Times are changing and no one can stop it. In paragraph 9 it says who will be responsible if the car happens to mess up the manufacturer or the driver.

Think to yourself who would you hold responsible. Knowing that all technology malfunctions,not to mention the car would be overly priced just for it to be able to drive without a driver and sense things. Most people like being aware if their surroungings. What if the car stoped and the driverless addition stoped working .You would already be used to not driving and over all forget how to do it. You wouldn't be aware of where you are because you were to busy doing other things then to know your surroundings.

Knowing how to drive makes things easier on you. Technology is not always a good thing. Technology doesn't always work out the way you want it too its easy to look something up and the internet not give you what you want or what's true would you trust your care taking you to where ever? It's easy saying something is better because it has technology incorperated but is that really true.

Some things are better left with out all the added gadgets and I belive a car is one of those things. A car is more reliable when you personaly are controling it. You know where you are going and I think if they want to make additions to are car make tires that don't go flat or make the car fix its self. Knowing how to get places yourself will make things so much easier on you. If your tire goes flat your car can not take you to the nearest area to call someone or get help.

0a22908,"The author of this work is in favor of taking on the great challenge of landing a ""rover"" on Venus for research and exploration. Venus has many extreme conditions that the earth does not have to endure. The author presented many ""solutions"" to these problems. Although plausible, the creations would be impractical and would not produce ensured results. The author's support for the idea of exploring Venus is mediocre at best.

Being the second-closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration. With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a ""blimp"" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money.

An additional idea that was brought up by the author was ""Silicon electronics."" Siliscon electronics would be resistent to the harsh conditions on the planet-- for a while. The systems would run for about a month before total failure. these silicon systems are very expensive to bein with and are still in the development phase here on earth. Creating enough silicon circuits to power a rover or vehicle would take years to manufacture. And by the point of satisfactory innovation for silicon electronics, a new product may have been presented.

Lastly, a ""cave-man"" idea of mechanical computers came into play. These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all. Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices. When made out of an acid-resistent substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work. The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth. There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research.

The author of this article is trying to push a principle that is not fully developed yet. The reasons that were provided may work after many years of design and development, but right now, none are practical. A combination of the three presented ideas may actually work the best. Use a blimp to float above the planet, tie a cable to the blimp that connects is with machanical machinery, and use silicon electronics to transmit the findings. Damage could be repaired by raising the equipment back up to the blimp. Innovation does not come easy for those who are in charge of it, but ideas like this are needed in providing an answer for a difficult question.

Overall, the author's arguments do not satisfy the overall risk and reward stakes. After more time passes, maybe he will write another article depicting what will work for sure. The support was not presented in a way that was convincing enough to dive right in to this new frontier of space.

0a238c3,"Driverless cars have been in all of our minds since television and moives have put them there. Google has had driverless cars since 2009, but are they safe to be in one. While haveing a driverless car seems epic it does have some downfall to it. Driverlesss cars , or smart cars, are a bad idea because it cost a large amount of money, a driver must be on the wheel and on alert at all times, and it even has problems with the law.

Driverless cars in the late 1950s had to run on a special track. The smart-road systems worked well. It was actully a succesful test, but it would have require massive upgrades to the existing roads. The roads would be too expensive to upgrade. So instead of smart-roads they moved on to smart cars. The smart cars would need a lot of sensors to work. The senors would of course become more advance, but so well the cost.

Although the smart cars cost a large amount it also still needs a driver at the wheel. The car can handle speeds up to 25mph, but the sensors make sure the dirver hold on to the wheel. Even though it is a smart car none of the cars can go without a driver at the wheel. The car would need a driver for roads it can't navigat thourgh. Such as work zones and around accidents. The car can not navigat thourgh these places which is why it alerts the driver that the need to take control of the wheel. To improve this the manufacturers put cameras in the smart car to watch driver. They make sure that the driver is focused on the road. If there is a road the car needs help with, it would vibrate the seat to alert the driver.

Even if the car can alert the driver the law focus on on how focused the driver is. In some states it is illegal to test a computer-driven car. Such states worry the the car would cause an accident to the passengers, and pedestrians. If the traffic laws change it would still need to cover liability of the accident. So if the car fails and caused an accident would the driver or manufacturer be at fault.

So in the end driverless cars are a horribly idea. They would cost a large amount of money. As well as they are not actully driverless and needs someone to be there, and they are agist the law at some states. Driverless cars should just stay in television and moives.",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument against driverless cars.

0a834e9,"The new software update, the Facial Action Coding System can calcutale how people feel or what emotion they are feeling. This software is the lastest invention from Prof. The six basic emotions humans have can be read or showed by this Facial Action Coding System. This new technology is being tested to see if it is valuable in the classroom to read the emotional expressions of students. I belive this tecnology wouldn't be valuable in the classroom or learning enviroment. This technology doesnt benifit the students learning or relate to their school subjects.

Facial Action coding System can calculate human emotional expressions. It calculates how you feel or waht you are feeling. I don't think this software would be valuable in the classroom because it is invading the kids personal space. Having the teachers or the computers always knowing how you feel is creepy. In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Simle"" it states that humans perform this task or calculation of reading people's emotions everyday. The artical also states that humans most likly can tell how otheres or how their friends are feeling by looking at their faical expressings. Having Facial Acton Coding System in the classroom would just be unessasary and invading others personal space.

This software or technology only reads humans emotional expressions, it does'nt teach anything or help people learn anything benifiting to school. If this technology was to be put into classrooms it wouldnt be benifiting to the kids or teaching them anything related to their school work. The artical states that the computer would be able to tell when a student is confused or bored while doing a leason. Most schools don't even teach leasons on the computer a teacher teaches them the leason they are learning. Also some kids or even their parents wouldn't want a computer to be reading their childrens emotions 24/7, also the students may not want to be monitored all the time aswell. This technology just isn't benificial to the learning enviroment in that sort of way.

The software update, the Facial Action Coding System is cool on how it reads humans emotions and tells you how they are feeling, but it just isn't valuable to classrooms or the learning enviroment. This software invades otheres person sapce by always monitoring their emotional expressions and calculating how u feel. Some people might find it creepy on the fact they are always being read by this new technology. This new technology isn't valuable to classrooms also because it it is not benifical to kids learning.

0a9488d,"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 ""Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency.""  If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that """"faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these ""faithless"" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a one-sided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country (population wise), they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well.    ",6,4.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 4**

0aae146,"The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.

To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?

Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" (21). While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced.

In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.                              ",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

0ada1e2,"Dear, Florida Senators

I believe that the Electoral College is a good way of voting for a President and Vice President because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by  a single vote in Congress. The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors is the meeting where the electors vote for there President and Vice President. Plus the majority of the 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President of the United States. The United States entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One each of the memebers in the House of Representives plus two of your Senators. In our state, each citizens have there own group of voters that vote for a President and Vice President of there chose. Some even vote for candidates that are going for a person running for President or Vice President. Our state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. '

Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If I lived in Texas, for example, and wanted to vote for [Adam] Pis , I'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Pis. On the note, that those electors won the statewide election, they would goto congress and Pis would get 34 electoral votes. There are a lot of questions that people ask, who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state that some citizens are living in because some states can have picked electors and some dont even pick electors so, it must depends what state the citizen lives in.

Perhaps worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representive from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Its hard to think about this but some are right, abolish the electoral college!

0b5c44b,"Alien comics are the real deal?

The average conspiracy theorist might think the picture of the ""Face"" was created by aliens but science and reasearch shows otherwise. Many people connect space with aliens but it's all really fiction. Everyone wants to believe that those comics and fairytales they used to read when they were younger are actually real. So any piece of information from mars that could be the slightest bit connected to earth makes everyone go bananas! Here is why your ideas and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas Are way off.

First, How are you putting out their ideas and beliefs but we have yet to see you guys give any evidence whats so ever. See, The team at NASA has actually done research and it's our job. When we went out to the sight where the ""Face"" is located Us and other scientists figure it was just another Martian mesa, Also, these are common around cydonia, Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Next, If this accusation was in deed Truthful why in the world would we hide this from anyone!? It would honestly help us and make us even more financially stable.

Even when we revealed the picture it engaged many common citizens and it attracted attention to mars. So, even if the whole alien thing was true it would really benfit the people. Not only are they going to learn about possibly Alive aliens but they get to learn even more about mars and how they function in space.

Also, We've provided all the evidence that we possibly can. We even went back out to The sight and took pictures again to prove these you and the rest of the conspiracy thoerists wrong. When we went back out to the sight we used a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

Now you and many might say ""Well i still don't think their telling the truth, their probably hiding something because it might discredit them and their business.""

Well, NASA and the rest of the scientist have done all we can. Our job is to explore space and find new things that might help us on earth. So, after all the reseach we've done. Plus all the trips we've made back out there to provide the community with evidence and pictures and you guys still don't believe us thats your problem. When conspiracy theorist provide us with 100 percent credible and sufficent information then we can look into it more but for now you guyses Arguement is full of opinions.

In conclusion, This is how you and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas are very false and irrelevant. NASA has been in business for awhile now and we like to be looked at as very honest, diligent and hardworking people. We do not at all appreciate you and you team degrading us. We spend thousands and thousands of dollars each mission just so we can have evidence and Information that is accurate. We take our jobs very seriously. After speaking with you today i hope you can rethink your ideas and your beliefs because we've done everything we could to provide you and the rest of the people with good sources to support our decision and our arguement.

0b8588b,"I'm wanting to keep the Electoral College because it comes in handy in our system for voting. They can help us break a tie between two competing candidates that want to become presidents of the United States. You may not think its a big deal but it is. I don't like the ""winner-take-all"" system, I find it unfair that the president can automatically win a vote from one state. They need to get use to the voting system instead of winning one automatically. The one thing I like about the voting system is that people can pick who would be the best candidate for our nation. For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation. Now back on to the subject, the Electoral College can be important to the system. The bad side of the Electoral college is that under its system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect for the president. The singel best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Us Americans should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. If you don't like my opinion, then make a new system that is close enough to be a consensus.         ",1,3.0,,": The essay develops a point of view on the Electoral College, but it is not consistently supported throughout the essay.

0b9d88d,"Driverless cars are cars with an automated driving system. Cool right? Using binary code, sensors and even 3-D imaging to check surroundings. Sounds futuristic like something from Back to The Future or Star Trek. But what good could they really do in society. Driverless cars are coming but should they? Society today can do better without technology controlling even more of our lives and something so vital as cars.

Google has gotten a head start on this process of driverless cars. The article states the car can ""read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code."" Yes the car is smarter than the average human being, that's because it's a computer. A computer cannot make judgement calls like a human being. With the intent on not crashing a driverless car could make mistakes and not know that they are mistakes. Such as hitting a child in order to avoid crashing into a tree. Something this article did not touch on was that the Google self driving car had its first accident last week when it hit the side of a bus in Northern California.

Today we have sensors and cameras in our cars but the driver maintains the speed, directions and trajectory of the car and where it goes. Humans must remain alert at all times, as stated in this article. Even though with self driving cars there is no human error involved consequences could emerge from there being to many of these types of automobiles on the road at once.

If this car goes into mass production problems will emerge just like with every other car brand. We have today many tools to assist our cars in knowing when to stop, turn and check coolant and power steering levels. We are still in control. In the article isn't was stated that if a problem should arise ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" What if this function doesn't work? Should the driver always have to hands on the wheel or would that ruin the point of this driverless car.

Is society ready for this or is this years in the making and we are just getting ahead of ourselves. Either way self driving cars should not be allowed on the street without a driver until the technology is 100% proven error free. This could take some time but it's worth it. This will significantly limit the cost of lives that could come from unnecessary laziness caused by this driverless car.

0c02064,"In movies and televison, driverless cars have been featured as an invetntion for the distant future. Automakers have begun to attempt the creation of driverless cars. There have been creations close to the driverless car but not exactly what people have been wanting to create. Driverless cars are a pointless invention idea and should not be developed any further.

Companies should not continue to pursue the driverless car idea any longer. Google has tried since 2009 to make driverless cars and they have been close to making one. The cars that Google has made can, ""drive moe than half a milion miles wothout a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't fully driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"". The cars are not fully dirverless if they have to alert the driver to take over driving for a while through traffic. The driverless car should be independent and not need help from the driver on issues like traffic and pulling in and out of driveways. In 2013, BMW created a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" but not a driverless car, which is the goal not a car that can only help with traffic. Smart cars have lots of sensors that can help guide divers through difficult jams or passage ways but those sensors cannot function without some help from the driver. The smart cars made by BMW, ""steer, accelerate, and breake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" . Their cars are close to the function of a driverless car but still need more work to be done in order to be able to drive without humans. Since the cars today still have not been developed like the driverless car it is pointless to continue to try. Even though driverless cars can be helpful there are laws that prevent some people from driving them. It is proven that, ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars"" . Most states will not allow the testing of let alone the driving of driverless cars. If driving one of those cars is not even allowed, then what is the point of developing the project further? The driverless cars should not be created since barely anyone is allowed to use them. Even if there was a change in traffic laws, ""new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident"". There need to be new laws covering the case of an accident about whether the blame is on the driver or the manufacturer. These new laws that would be set will take up time and could cause lawsuits. The technology in the car could fail and the someone could be injured and there would be the question of who is at fault. If someones safety is at stake then the car should not be made at all.

The idea of making a driverless car should not be continued. The car is a pointless idea that does not seem to actually work and would fail. There have already been multiple attempts at making this car and all have come close but failed. The project should be ended and automakers should stop wasting their time on this car and focus on the other cars they make.

0c2f27d,"I think

that driverless cars are a good idea for tjhe majority of the time, but there are some people who will try and abuse the power of a driverless car. There were many negatives to using a driverless car like who is at fault when a accident occurs or who would want to drive a driverless car. I will tell you my argument for why I strongly believe that driverless cars are not so much of a good idea.

For my frist reason evin if there are some catious drivers in the U.S. there are more uncatious drivers than catious drivers. If we have driverless smart cars then people will be put at more risk then when they were manually operating of their vehicle. Also what if a malfunction occurs and one or more drivers or pedestrians get hurt then, ""who is at fault- the driver or the manufactuer?"" says the article and I would believe that the manufactuer would be at fault but one would say otherwise.

My next reason is that a lot of driving laws would be altered or changed and more laws would be added. That is a big time consuming process and development would change every year with new designs, and other things of the sorts. With changing or adding laws people will start to loose their intrest in the car and look for something new in a manually operated vehicle. Most people would try and say that it is worth the wait but why wait for new technology that could malfucntion without alerting the driver like it says in the article about the development of the driverless car.

My final reason is that it is a big waste of money and could hurt one or more if not developed with the right technology and the right safety percaution are taken. The article says that there would be considerations of flashing lights in the windshield and this could be a big hazard because it could possabliy blind the driver also it could distract on coming traffic. The reason this would be a big waste of money is because if one were to get in a accident then there driverless car is completely totaled and rendered useless. Also with all the new features that would be added the cost of the car would be doubled most likely so this would be a very exspensive purchase for most who even considered trying the new technology.

In conclusion I have said for the most part a driverless car is pretty useful in many ways, but if you think about the big key which is safety then you would have to reconsider your choice. Even with the fact the car will be equip with many ways to alert the driver when it is time for them to take control it would just not work with the safety standards of most people. So really it all falls back on safety, so this is why I strongly believe that driverless cars are not a good idea.               ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument.

0c34cc0,"Limiting car usage can be very beneficial. It would improve communities, reduce pollution, and create better lifestyles.

By reducing the usage of cars, you allow for your community to flourish in other ways than building or repairing roads. Since there would be less people driving cars, the community can focus on other things. For example, in Bogota, Columbia, because of the Day Without Cars, there have been 118 miles of bicycle paths that have been constructed. Also, ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city."" Old sidewalks are being replaced with new ones, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have also opened up. All of these great things are happening to the community of Bogota, Columbia, just because they have limited their usage of cars (source 3).

Also, limiting the use of cars would reduce pollution. In places like Paris, France, diesel has been blamed for Paris' days of nar-record pollution. Paris has more smog than most other European capitals, because they have more people driving cars (source 2). ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the US"" (source 1).

Finally, decreasing the usage of cars would create better lifestyles for people. People would be healthier and happier, because instead of driving around everywhere, they get some fresh air and more exercise. Heidrun Walter said that ""when [he] had a car [he] was always tense. [He is] much happier [not driving his car]"" (source 1). Also, don't you hate it when you're stuck in the rush-hour? In Bogota, Colombia, rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic (source 3).

Reducing the usage of cars in any community would result in many great things. The community would be able to flourish, there would be less pollution, and people would be living better, happier lifestyles.    ",3,5.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 5**

0c4ede2,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author gives us positive information and negative information. Different people are going to have different opinons on driverless cars. Some may think it is a good idea while some may think that it is a bad idea. There is no right or wrong answer. It is based on your personal opinion on what you think of driverless cars. I believe that it is kind of dumb to have driverless cars. There are many bad things that can happen with them such as safety hazards, unattentiveness while driving and accidents that may occur with them.

Driverless cars are not a good idea to me. When you drive you always have to be attentive. Driving is already not the safest thing in the world. There is always people walking out in front of you, animals running out in front of you and many other things. If you get a car that can drive for you there is bound to be something bad to happen. A computer is all that the car is. Computers go down all the time in the world and they shut down. What if your car happened to stop working in the middle of the highway where the speed limit is seventy-five miles per hour. There would be many accidents happening if that was the case. There is a positive thing about them though they can help you if you have children in the backseat. If they are acting up and you put your car on autopilot then you can get them to quit arguing. But still it is a very dangerous idea. No way would I trust a car to be able to drive me places when I barely trust myself driving me places. So I don't believe that these cars are one hundred percent safe. I think that there are many safety hazards that they could bring.

I also think that driveless cars are a bad idea because no matter what you have to be attentive. If you look away to the side for three seconds and your driving, your car is already the that side of the road. I believe that if there is going to be television and stero systems in these cars, that people are not going to be paying attention to the road, they are going to be paying attention to the televsion or whatever may be on in theirr car. When I drive I listen to the stero and it distracts me when a good song comes on. I could not imagine what I would be like if I had a television in my car. The good side about these driverless cars with televsion in them is that if you are going on a long road trip with your family and you want to watch televison you could. I know that when I take long road trips I wish that I could bond with the person that is driving. So it would be a good thing for families that had little ones. If the little kids were getting cranky then they could cuddle up next to mommy or daddy or whoever may be driving. But again the driver would not be attentive or aware of there surrroundings if that was to happen. They would probably fall asleep if they were relaxing to much and dozed off.

Finally I believe that these cars can cause many highway or country road accidents. For example, if a family was watching a movie and their was a sudden stop on the road they are most likely going to run right into that person in front of them. If it is a sudden stop there is no way a computer can see that and slam on the brakes. If it could do that though, the person behind the car would probaly get ran into. Like I have said in the beginning all this car is, is a computer. I mean my computer goes down so many times in a day. I would not rely on a computer made car for the life of me. There are already so many accidnets that happen when people are driving, there is no need to add a computer made car and let it make accidents to. I think that for a car to be completely driverless or ninty percent driveless is ridiculous. On the plus side of this if a car that was driveless did happen to work then it would come in handy for long trips on the road. If there was a actual car that got tested and it could go on for hundreds of thousands of miles and not wreck now that would be pretty amazing. But in my opinon I do not think that there is a car that is capable of being able to do that. A car takes human assistance to drive and if it all technology no way could it work effectively. There is going to be accidents if cars become ninty perfect driveless or any percent driveless

This concludes my opinion on driveless cars. I think that they would be a very neat invention but I do not believe for one second that they would work all the tie one hundred percent. I have been driving for a year now and have already been in accidents because I was not paying attention. So I know that being a human and driving is already complicated enough, I do not believe that a computer could handle it. I know that companies are trying their best to make this become an actual thing in the world but I don't think that it is belivable. I think that they could make them, I just do not believe that they would work that great. I am with the idea that there is no way

driveless car is even imaginable. So with the facts I have presented here I am sticking to my topic that driveless cars are the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard of.

Last, Delivery Companies often argue that they lost to much revenue, later in the week they made plug in cars and hybrids carrying over 3m passengers.

0cc9cb5,"The electoral college is pointless, I believe that it is just another step that was added to the long process of picking our new president. It causes problems between the people and the government and it takes away time that we could be using to do something actually beneficial to our country. The electoral college is not a place but a group of people who meet and vote for the President and Vice President. Each state gets represented by a certain amount of electors which is decided by the population of that specific state. The electoral college should be thrown out of the way that we choose our president becuase it upsets the people, it can completley change elections, and because it gives to much power to the legislative branch.

I think that the electoral college gets people frustrated with our government. They have to go basically vote for another person to vote. If I lived in texas I would go to a poll and vote for the person that I wanted to put up in the electoral college. That person would then vote for the president. It makes voters, mad why spend time for voteing on people who you dont really care about when you could honeslty just vote for the President who you believe could help our country. The biggest argunment against the electoral college is that it we can't control who our elector votes for. You see when you go to vote for an elector you normally vote for one who says that they are going to vote for the person that you like, but they can change their mind and now you voted for someone that is going to vote for the candidate that you didnt want.

The electoral college can completely change the direction of a vote. Becuase voters only have one vote, the electors represent alot of the states population. For example a single representitive from samller states like Wyoming can represent of to 500,000 voters and in bigger states like California can have up to 55 electors who represent as much as 35 million people. This is why the electoral college can have such a big effect on the voting proces exspecially since the electors represent such a large amount of people. It can become frustrating when a large mass of people ellect some one and that elector changes there mind about  who they vote for, because a group of people as large as 500,000 can be ruiting for one person and the elector can change his mind and now that group 500,000 is voting for someone that they don't like.

Another problem is that the electoral college gives to much power to legislative branch ""Back in 1960 segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy becuase it would have been overthrown by the college. Which meens that the Legislative branch has enough power to create a biased slait. The legislature would create a group of electors that are all in favor of certain idea and you wouldnt be able to vote for anyone else becuase those are the people for your state. The point of voting is to give power to the people and with the electoral college in the way it completely takes that away from us. We get to vote for the electors but that doesnt meen that they are going to vote for the people that we want them to.

Yes the electoral college could have some advanteges like allowing professionals to have an input into what is going on, It helps us avoid run-off elections (elections that end up with a tie), and restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. But there are definalty more cons to this procedure. The constitution states that we are here to create a more perfect union but how are we supposed to create a union when the government is basically in control of everything. There is no unity gouing on in our government it more like the government is in charge and we are kind of just here. If we get rid of the electoral college it will make the people happier and allow them to actually feel like part of the government, It will stabilize elections and not allow the legistaure to change them, and will take away some of the numerous powers that the Legislative branch holds. All in all the electorla cllege os unfair, outdated, and irrational. It need to be abolished!            ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue and demonstrates some critical thinking.

0d2070c,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is speculated to have been the most similar to Earth, studying it can be done at reasonable expectations, and combatting the difficulty of studying Venus will have great benefits to our knowledge on the planet itself and space exploration.

It has long been a conspiracy yet to be proven as to if Venus is one of our known sister planets that are the most similar to Earth today. Space explorers long ago predicted that Venus was likely covered with large oceans and had the potential to possibly support multiple forms of life. Without an indepth study of Venus at a close and personal view, nothing can be predetermed factually. In paragraph four the author explains that ""it [Venus] may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This shows that the possibility is there but without extra measures taken to pursue an indepth study, the question remains unanswered as to if Venus is a sister planet of Earth.

While an upclose, indepth view of Venus is not predictable due to the harsh environment, NASA has found potential ways to make exploration dueable to an extent. In paragraph five, the author states that: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This helps widen the idea that exploration of Venus can be done and met at a reasonable expectation and limit safe for explorers. The author proceeds to state that while the conditions are not particularly easy they are ""survivable for humans."" This helps detail and push for the idea of the exploration of Venus because it is and has been discovered that the study can be done safely.

The overall study of Venus can prove to be extremely beneficial to our knowledge on the planet alone, and our knowledge on space exploration at most. In paragraph eight, it is stated that ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value."" In which it does, combatting the challenge of Venus proves to be tough, but if done, it can mean more to the exploration of other planets that are tougher than Venus alone. Further in paragraph eight, it is said that ""travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Once we begin to limit our exploration and discoveries due to the dangers and doubts, we take away from our progression of knowing what is out of our way. With the study of Venus we can extend our doings to meet every innovation and curiosity about our solar system all together.

Studying Venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it presents. With the study of Venus we can determine if Venus is a sister planet of our planet today, and if the planet was once inhabitable for organisms and humans. Studying Venus is also worth the pursuit because the study can be done, and if the study is done, it will benefit us far more than the study of any other planet has yet to. The study of Venus will bring our knowledge and our future immense benefits in all aspects.    ",6,4.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 4**

In paragraph two im going talk about the negative effects on the situation. For our third body paragrapgh i'll be introducing the

Cofounder Sergey Brin says that he foresees that we'd use half of the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility then a bus. In 2013, BMW announced that these driverless cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020! The cars that Google has had since 2009 have driven more than half a million miles without a single crash. They alert drivers when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

One negative question I have for these driverless cars is, ""Whats the point of having these cars if you still need a driver""? New laws will be needed in order to cover liabilty in case of an accident. ""If technology fails and someone gets injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer? This requires human skills which means humans have to be alert at all time in case of emergency. These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads.

""In 1980's automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. These sensors are in need of improvements so that these driverless cars can be capable to handle more of the driving task that can lead to dangerous accidents. The 1980 cars had become more advanced to detect respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. IN the end these cars just need a lot of sensors so they can sense when things are about to occur.

Today i've talked about three different preview points. In the first body paragraph I talked about the positive upside of the driverless cars. In the second paragraph I had a dicussion about negative effects on driverless cars. With my third body paragraph I ended with talking about smarter cars and their sensors.

There are many different things that the humans just phiscally need to do and driving is one of them. The development of cars that can get you from point a to point b is already good enough. Most teenagers and adults like the thought of them being able to drive phsically and mentally.

Though it is an admirable arguement, it is simply not supported throughout this type of article.

In the article, the author does not support his or her argument well because of his or her informative over-kill, lack of analysis, and lack of data in his or her favor.

To begin, the author gives us too many facts that are simply just an introduction. In paragraph three, the whole paragraph is stating facts about Venus and its atmosphere.

For example the author states that, ""...atmospheric pressure is 90 times great than what we experience on our own planet.""

This does resonate with the arguement considering that it is about how Venus should be explored despite the challenges.

The real problem with this example is that this is placed in the third paragraph and everything before it was also facts.

The author spent three paragraphs talking about the weather of Venus instead of analyzing how it should be disregared and we should explore it for better reasons. Additionally, the author gives facts that have nothing to do with the arguement provided.

In the second paragraph, the author states that, ""...sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.""

This simply has nothing to do with the supposed topic.

Not only is there too many facts, but these facts have nothing to do with the topic and the author seems to -in fact- trail off a bit.

Multiple times.

Additionally, the author seems to provide no analysis towards the plethera of information.

For example, the first true analysis is seen is in paragraph five when he or she states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

By the time someone is writing to paragraph five, there should already be an extreme of amount of noticable analysis before that.

The basic structure of any arguement would be to state a fact, and give a well thought-out analysis about that fact and how it applies to one's topic.

The noticable structure here, would be an overwhelming amount of facts, and then slight analysis by assuming that the evidence speaks for itself.

When you have that much information thrown at the reader at once, the evidence really doesn't speak for itself.

That's where the supposed analysis comes in.

The analysis is supposed to connect the dots for the reader and explain how it applies.

It seems that is lacking here.

Finally, the author seems to be arguing against themselves with the type of evidence that is being presented.

Throughout the whole article the author seems to be only stating the things wrong with this idea.

For example in paragraph two, the author states that, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for than a few hours.""

Then backed that up with no analysis on how that should be worth the risk so scientists can can continue exploring.

This is a problem because that is the point of the article: that despite all the risks, scientists should perservere. That's is not what followed that unsettling fact, though.

All that followed was more facts.

Additionally in paragraph six, the author finally states a good fact on how exploration can continue, but then follow it with analysis that once again goes against the arguement.

For example, after talking about the solution NASA has made to this problem, the author follow it with, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide limited insight...""

This was a poor choice of support because the author is basically going against his or her idea, without reconciling it.

In conclusion, the author makes it unclear which side he or she is trying to prove.

It is a very well-written article, but only for informational purposes.

If one it looking for a well-supported idea on how despite all the risks, science should continue, this article is not the place to look.

If anything, it seems that the author is arguing against continuing to explore Venus-considering all the facts and analysis that went against the idea.

Once again, this is a well written informative article, not an arguable one.",6,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue, but does so inconsistently and with inadequate examples and evidence.

0e426b4,"Have you ever had a dream about a car driving itself while you just layed back and relaxed? So have many other people. Companies have been working on developing a self driving car. There have been hopes and stories about this since as early as the 1950's, but now we have the technology to actually do this wonderful thing.

At the beginning of this experimentation for the self driving car, lots of people trying to get it to work were using ""smart"" roads. Roads that had electrical cables or magnets in it, but the cost for ""smart"" roads would not be worth it. ""Smart"" cars though are cheaper than fixing and replacing all of the roads in the world. ""Smart"" cars had many sensors, video cameras, and a GPS receiver. They have a sensor on top of the car that is constantly making a three-dimentional model of the cars surrounding so the car can react to what is going on around it.

The Google ""smart"" cars have been in progress since the year 2009. Their cars have driven a bit over half a million miles, and the cars have yet to get into an accident. So by logical conclusion, the ""smart"" cars reduce the accidents that happen or at least reduce the frequency. Then cars are still not fully done. Yet some places are allowing companies to test the cars out on open roads, such as: California, Florida, District of Columbia, and Nevada. Sadly these cars are not fully complete so some still need the assistance of humans when it comes to accidents or moving to avoid the work zones.

""Smart"" cars are very useful and have alot of wonderful benifits to them. These cars will very much likely use less fuel than the average car or taxi. They are less pron to get into accidents than human driven cars. They will take a bit more supplies to make these cars be able to do everything the need to be able to do to handle the real roads, but with all the money saved on fuel and all the money saved on not having as many accidents, it will all be worth it.

These ""smart"" cars are revolutionary and are changing the world, and as science continues to change and evolve each day, I'm sure we will soon aceive the goal of a car that con completely drive on its own with no human help. They take less gas and reduce the number of accidents. Who can complain with that. What do you say? Are you for or against self driving cars?",2,4.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue of self-driving cars and provides some examples and evidence to support its position.

0e5feb0,"The autthor of the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus has used some substanital evidence to try and coax us twoards believing that Venus a a planet that has not been studied as much as it should be but i think other wise. Venus is a risky investment with the technology that we have a availble. I belive we waste time and money on Venus where it could be used on existing problems and studies on a planet where it will be moost effective.

One portion of the passage that the author tried to push in your face was the fact that Venus had/has a great deal of geographical similarities to Earth. He said thisngs such as "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size""

which appeal to a certain group of individuals who are afcinated by the thought of there being somewhere else like earth. The author also says "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This also would appeal to that same group of pepole giving them the thought that they are going to be able to live on Venus but still there are the harsh living conditions that contrdict that thinking.

In opposition to what the author says about Venus and its geographical similarites we also need to talk about the differences that cause problems not only for living on the planet but also studying it. Venus has an atmosphere that is ""97 percent carbondioxide""

which alone has ended the thought that Venus can any longer sustain life as they think i could before. Also the atmosphere makes it hard to even get any documentation on how the planet looks. In paragraph 7 the author uses the substance silicon carbide as an example of a way to get around the crazy atmoshpere but this leads me to my next point that the author failed to even mention in the passage, all of this study and exploration costs money.

The author forgot to mention one of the most cruccial pecies to the equation which is where is funding coming from and where could the money be used more effectivly. Or economy at the moment is not stable and be are in great need of help but that does'nt mater to some. They are more focused on the future how we are going to advance but without a good present situation there is no way we could proceed. The money could be given to the city of Flint, Michigan so that they are able to drink and bathe themselves with clean water. Im sure that it costs way less to fix the pipelines in city that to take years and fly to Venus.

Venus and the other planets are cool specticals but we were given our own plant that we have beaten and mistreated for years but we don't to go back and fix the problem search for somewhere else to destroy. I think that we should at least try to better the situaton with the money that we have for the planet that we have not to spend on the expoloration of the others.",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and consistent point of view.

Just that alone is engouh to prove any conspiracy theory wrong!

0eb2865,"To whom it may concern,

The growing debate on whether or not the electorial college is necessary for when the country is voting for it's president. I am writing to argue that the electorial college is vitial to the presidential election process becuase it evens out the importance of all the states' votes, gives us a certainty of an outcome, and allows for toss-up states to vote for the best candiate.(Posner) It can be precieved that the electorial college is a non-democratic way of voting for the president. Although it may be seen like that, it is in fact favorable towards the people becuase the electors that you indirectly vote for are voting for the same candidate as you were. The electorial college has been around for decaades and has very few times caused a disruption in our country. Why should we eliminate a process that has worked for years and will continue to work for years to come?

The electorial college should be kept becuase it allows for the smaller states to compete against the larger states in terms of votes for the presidency. A state like California has a larger population than Alaska so in turn they would have more voters. The electorial college evens out the number of people per state that votes so the candidiate chosen is truly who the country wants as the president. A larger state would also get more attention than a smaller state due to it's size difference. Smaller states would get discouraged and soo only the larger and more populated areas would vote becuase they are getting the most attention from the candidates themselves.(Posner) Our country is made up of fifty states and all of them should have an equal imput in who runs our counrty.

Many of the time voters will vote becuase they want to have their party in the president's seat. There are some states that are called swing states that will vote for the president that they beileve will have the best impact on our country reguardless of thei party preference. The electorial college lets the voters from these toss up states vote for the best candidate becuase they are more likely to make thought out decisions because they listen to the candidates proposal and not their party.(Posner) With this in mind, that means that in the end the president chosen is thought to be truly the best winner for the presidency because the toss-up staes chose them over the other.

A dispute is possible when the outcome of the president's election is presented. However, it is likely that a dispute will happen if popular vote were to be the process of electing our president. There is very little chances that the electorial college will have a tie and there is the realisation that if popular voting were to happen, there would be more tied elections happenning. The country wants to have certainty when voting for their president and having the electorial college allows for every state to have a definite candidate and in turn the country can have a definite president by the end of the elections.

The electorial college is vitial when chosing the presdient becuase it gives us certainty in an outcome, evens out the importance of states votes, and gives swinger states an equal vote as well. We need to keep the electorial college and should it be eliminated, it could put our presidential elections at risk. For decades, the electorial college has worked and our founding fathers believed it was necessary. I implore to you thatkeeping the electorial college is the best for the president's elections.

Just think how much money they save for not paying for gas,car payments and parking places,plus if you dont have a car its always good to ride a bike or walk somewhere. And 75% sold there car just to move here. Its easier for citys to walk and drive around somewhere. Its easy now to get where you need to go if you walk because they made stores close by so you can walk to them.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. If you had a even or odd license plate one day you werent aloud to drive that day you had to wait. But some people did not follow this rule about 4,000 drivers were fined. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after having some of the people not drive and after five days of intensifying smog. Cold night and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap in car emissions. What they are doing is really good because this could help people not drive as much.

Bogota,Colombia people hiked,biked,skated or took buses to work during a car free day. It was the third straight year cars have been banned. Only buses and taxis were allowed for work and transportation. Even when it had rained they didnt care they still kept walking. Parks,Sport centers and shopping stores have gotten alot better because of the people walking. For a very first time Colombian cities ,Cali and Valledupar joined this event too.1990's is when they started a day without cars in Bogota.

Trying to make less people drive now a days. President Obama's goals is to curb the united states greenhouse gas,it says americans are buying fewer cars ,fewer licenses and driving each year. The kids now a days dont really care about driving too much or care to even get a license. Driving by young people decreased 23 percent bewtween 2001 and 2009. The number of people driving now has gone down from the miles on the cars.

0ec99dd,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile ,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Now for this techology to be used in the classroom I have mixed feelings on weather this is appropriate to use. In the other hand it could potentially increase the student body to be more compatiable with being in school and truly enjoying the enviorment and space that they are in. Due to the fact that the teachers know how the students feel or mentally react to on what is happining.

The reason that I feel that this should not be used in school is the fact that it violates all of the personal and private feelings of a student and the lack of emotions it can tell, According to the text it states "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger , disgust, fear and sadness"". There are more emotions than that. One out of the six actually represent something good and happy the other five are more on the sad and unhappy emotions. Another quote from this article states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"". If that is true then there would no point in for an emotion to tell you how they truly feel. There is nothing better than another warm blodded person with emotions aswell to say something such as hey i can understand what your going through I feel the same way you didn't have to tell me but I knew.

On the other side of the spectrum and saying how this could benifit the students and the teachers is how to make the class or more engaging to the students. As stated in the article "" "" A classroom computer could recpgnize when a student is becoming confused or bored ,"" Dr. Haung predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" "" That could help a lot of students especially the ones eho normally dont like school. Plus this machine will potentially make you happier stated in the article "" The Mona Lisa demonstration is realy intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows you just how much this computer can do."" This coul help people with persay deppresion and confusion on making a choce or big decision on something.

This manchine the "" Facial Action Coding System"" could help with you arround your freinds or a crush/ significant other on how they truly feel twoards something. Aswell as trying or attempting to make them feel better. In the article stated it sites "" For instance, you could probably tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"" This could say help the autistic kids who cant read emotions or conversation ques, and understand them so they dont hurt somebodys feelings. Furthermore, the text states "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them. "" Doing so could help your freind whos having a bad day have a happier one or a loved one because thinking and trying to be happy will actually make you happy.

In conclusion in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I have personaly mixed emotions about this being used in schools as seen. Then again my overal feel of this is posiitive and sholud be regulated within schools. Due to how this may impact the teaching area and enivorment to best help the student or just a person in general.",5,3.0,,":** The essay addresses the topic and provides some relevant information about the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and its potential uses in the classroom.

Someone shouted,""Why are you here?""

I closed my eyes and prepared my speech, here goes nothing. ""My name is Luke Bomberger and I'm am here, gentlemen, to persuade you to join in a program called the Seagoing Cowboys program.""

There was a hushed silence as I finished my proposal. I could see the looks of confusion on many peoples' faces. I'm off to a good start.

After a few seconds there was mumbling in there was mumbling in the crowd.

""What's that mean?"" Someone shouted.

""What do we do in it?"" Another chimed in.

There were multiple questions being fired in my direction and I was starting to get a headache.

""Lower your voices!"" I shouted as I raised my hands in a stop gesture,""I can't answer your questions when you guys are being so loud.""

Finally th crowd calmed down.

One young man pushed himself to the front of the stage where I was and asked, ""What do we do if we join the program?""

I was prepared for this question and replied,"" Well, in this program you have to help take care of the animals, like horses and young cows, to cross the oceans.""

I felt like that sentence didn't have enough information, so I added,""World War II has ended and we need to assist other countries that have been affected by the war.""

""WIll it be boring?"" One man asked from the back of the crowd. All eyes were on me, their gazes intent on what I was about to say.

I stopped and mulled over my thoughts before answering,""Well, not really. You would be able to see other countries and their landscapes, but you would have to clean the stables and feed the animals. When they are returned to their destination, on the return trips you can have a lot of fun. I had played some sports like baseball and table-tennis with the other boys who had join during one trip back to America.""

The crowd looked interested. I felt like I had said the important parts to persuade them.

""Is it dangerous?"" One person said.

""It can be at time when it's raining extremely hard on deck."" I admitted.

I thought I needed to say more, so I added,""All the adventures you can have will be exciting, but one thing this program has helped me be aware of is the people of other countries and their needs. I played my part in assisting others, will you do the same?""

There was excited murmmuring as everyone surged forward. I felt pride in what I had said.

There would be many required updates to the curent roads. Along with the roads, laws would have to be updated as well.

I do not believe that driverless cars are the best kind of cars for these reasons.

Although there have been many good improvements on the modern car, such as seat belts and air bags, I do not think that driverlessness will be one of them. They have created many improvements to the driverless cars, but they are still not totaly driverless. A machine can not take place of a human. Even though driverless cars have all the technology needed to drive on the average road, they still need help to get in or out of driveways or dealing with traffic issues. The car cannot stear itself thorugh roadwork or accidents. What is the point of a driverless car if it cannot drive itself?

Another reason the driverless cars are a thing of the future and not of the now is because there would require far too many updates to the current road system. I do not think that it would be safe if there was a mixture of driverless and non-driverless cars on the same road. What if a driverless ""'driver'' did not the warning to take over soon enough and ran into an non-driverless car. Whos fault would it be? The ""driver'' or the manufacturer. I do not think that driverless cars are in our best intrest because of all the updates they would require.

Another update required would be law updates. I think that if we went to driverless cars we would have to make everyone switch to driverless cars. If they work how the article clames, like a public-transport taxi system, than it would put a lot of public transportation workers out of buisness. I live in Indiana, on of the many states that do not allow test computer-driven cars. If our state won't even test them, then how are we suppost to know if we can trust them. I do not think that driverless cars would work for us because we do not live in a city. This would not be practical because in my town we do not use taxis, so why would we have access to driverless cars?

I do not think that driverless cars are in our best intrest because they are not totaly driverless. They would also require too many updates to our roads and our laws.

0f789a2,"There are many controversial ideas about what was seen in the picture on Cydonia. Some belive it was from alien life form some do not. I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens. I say this because we have pictures proving so, landforms are known to form in odd ways, and we have double checked and there were no signs of alien life forms.

The ""Face"" was not created by aliens because we have pictures proving so. In the article ""Unmasking The Face Of Mars"" they said that when they first saw a picture of this mysterious face is was the year 1976. A lot of changes were being made that year, it was the peak of technology for Americans and we were bound to go on in our experiments. it states in the article that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photo."" And in return it was a natural landform. But people were still not satisfied. They claimed that the picture was taken at a cloudy time of year for the Red Planet so they tried again as stated in the passage, "" Nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"" and the results were as followed, "" Marlins team captured an extroardinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution"" the results still came back as a lanform.

I do not believe that the "" Face "" was created by aliens because landfroms are known to form in odd ways. For example in the article it states that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the american west."" They claimed this after taking the picture April 8, 2001. The picture simply shows ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" as said in the article. How many times when we were all children did we think we saw someone when it was just a shadow? plenty of times and in this instance it is exactly the same.

And lastly I do not believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was created by alien life form because we have double checked and checked again and we did not find signs of any form of life on Mars. It said in the article that they took a picture in 1976, then they were astonished so they checked again in 1998, and then when people were still not satisfied they checked agin in 2001. It sates in the article that ""Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""

and not only that but, "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" this goes to show that there were no life forms ever there and that the face is simply landforms and shadows and that aliens did not have anything to do with this sittuation at all.

However though, it states in the article that "" The face of Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkou tlines for 25 years! some people think that the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars"" It is not uncommon or odd that peopkle would want to belive that there is another life forms besides what we already know, some would go as far to say that "" evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" as stated in the article. But the most shocking thing is when it says that "" defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" I don't see why anybody working with NASA would ever doubt the system if they are a aprt of it, but then again NASA most likely does not just give out important information to everybody who steps foot into there office claiming to work there. And it wouldn't surprise me actually if the budget defenders of NASA did wish that there was actualy life forms because NASA is having to dump more and more money because people like the ""conspiracy theorists"" can't just have faith and believe what NASA tells them even though they had evidence to back them up.

To all of this is still say that I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens . I say this because we have pictures and images proving so, landforms are know to grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and because we have double checked and checked and there were no signs of alien life or any form of life at all up on Mars. I think that the information that i have presented you with would go to show and prove my theory right.

0f8c21d,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus is most important to the Earth that is close to the planet where people in. Sometime the challenge of the planet is for humans to study, apprently it's proximity to us.

Not only studying Venus will pursuit other life, but some scientist are looking forward to work with the Venus to undertanst more of the challenge that they will know more about.

The first reason why venus will pursuit despite the danger it present is that venus are also a planet becuase the reader know that it's the second planet that from our sun. It could be a bad idea that '' Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface "". This is way studying are needed to be used with protection at any case that involved danger.

The second most reason important about the challenge of Venus in this planet as an enviornment would crush can be made as "" these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth "". Because of this solar system like Venus impact the hottes surface temperature of the planet. The challenging of Venus consider many researchers into working with the machines that probably would allow them to constribute it's to be knows as knowledge.

Most third reason that will be know is that scientics are more knowable to learn more about Venus than other people because they are more to understand better. More likely, "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation "" just as we know about how it should not be limited, most people woun't know what to do unless they know what will be next in their challenge. It somehow need to be survivable for humans as well into going forward on something that is challenge.

0fc8125,"Dear State Senator,

In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaine. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In Plumer's article he says,"" - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attenetion to the votes sent out. Acorrding to Plumer's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why I believe that  getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had  popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing.

To limit car usage has huge benefits; we can lessen the gasses that are polluted, lessening smog. It may not sound like something that effects your everyday life, but it does. Smog and air pollution are a problem, and a threat to our safety and well being. As of right now it is'nt a life or death situation, but if car usage continues to be a huge part of the world, all the air pollution from all the years of driving are going to get so bad people, and the earths atmosphere will be extremly affected by it. Think about your kids future, would you really want them to live in a world consumed by air pollution, and emission gasses, and smog.. To give an example, ""passneger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states"" (rosenthal). That just showing how much car usage affects air pollution and the air we breath everyday. Just decreasing the amount of car usage can reduce the smog, and air pollution in cities and towns.

Additionally, the less cars are used the more people and neighbors would intteract. If a majority of a town just lessened the amount they go out using a car, they would walk, or ride bikes, or take busses, etc.. imagine your town, and families and their kids taking a walk somewhere, or people riding their bicycles to their destination, everyone could meet their neighbors and talk. Overall, cities and towns and suburben areas would generally become just a friendly enviorment. Most people want to live in a place in which they feel safe and neighborly. Teenagers and families would get more excersise then the normal. Due to having to walk, and ride bikes or other things they would be getting out of the house more instead of sitting in a car then going and sitting some place then going back home and sitting around again, they would get the needed physical activity to stay some what healthy. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day""(selsky). That is amazing, and it is so good for people to get out and do things like that. Lessening car usage could completly change neighborhoods and towns and citiies.

Finally, Cars in the united states are highly expensive, and not everyone has thousands of dollars around to get the car they want/need. ""Cash strapped americans could not afford new cars""(Rosenthal). Just an example that cars are not cheap and a lot of people spend money they do not have on cars. In addition to buying the car, gas must be provided, depending on the car and the amount of gas it uses up, that can be pretty expensive. Insurance is another cost, everyone has to have insurance to be able to drive and own a car, thats a monthly fee coming out of our pockets. Limiting car usage could save a lot of money, it would leave extra money every day, week or month to go out and eat once in a while, or to buy other necisities. Just about everyone wants to have a little extra money, but with a car thats frequently used can use up almost 200 to 400 dollars each month. Riding a bike, or skateboarding or just simply walking is completly free.

Advantages in limited car usage are, The decrease in gas pollution and smog, it could create friendlier neighborhoods and towns, and lastly thousands of people would save a lot of money.                                 ",5,3.0,,":**

1013fcd,"The Facial Action Coding System is an unnecesscary piece of equipment. The software that would be able to detect the emotions of an individual would have several negative affects on society. The reading of emotions is a useful tool when it is detected by someone's natural instinct, but it would not be helpful to only have an understanding on someone's emotions due to the results given on a screen. The Facial Action Coding System is not a valuable to students because it would decrease the rate at which students learn, identifying someone's emotions will not change how they are feeling, and it would decrease their motivation for work in the future.

The ability for this device to detect the emotions of a student while they are working would be detrimental to the health and responsibilty of the student. The author states that the machines will ""recognize when the student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective intructor"" (D'Alto 6). This would be harmful to the students determination to learn. It would also cause several students to fall behind in their education. Every student experiences boredom in class, but the teacher is unable to change the lesson everytime to best fit one individual student because the other children will fall behind. Students are still capable of learning material when they are bored even if it is not as effectively as when they are interested. Students need to also learn how to work through their emotions to better their ability to improve. When these students get into the work field, they can not call in sick or slack off every time they experience a negative emotion. This device would be teaching children that they should only be productive if they are intrigued by their task. This would not be a proper lesson to teach growing individiuals.

The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels. Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful.

The technology that recognizes emotions in order to change the student potential will decrease their motivation. The skill to be compable of working through tough situations is essential to posess. Modifying a students' workload would harm their motivation. These students will no longer be motivation to be their most effective because they will expect everything in life to be modified to their liking. Unfortunately, this is not a trait that can be successfully transferred to real world issues. Therefore, these students will be less prepared for potential problems they may encounter. This system would also decrease the dependence on human connection. The text states that computers need to understand emotional communications because ""most human connection is nonverbal"" (D'Alto 6). Although that statement is true, there is little use for computers undertsanding how humans feel if they can not help the individual with their emotons. This may cause people to reply more on the machines, which would lessen the amount of human connection that exists--much like previous technology advances have done. Human connection is essential to a striving population, therefore it will have negative affect on society.

The Facial Action Coding Sytem would be wasteful to the society, and would cause several negative effects. It is not something worth investing in because it would harm the developing youth. Not only do these machines prove useless to emotions of people, but it will also decrease the motivation of students and future employees.",6,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue, arguing that the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is unnecessary and would have negative effects on society.

102d4b2,"This new peice of technology called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, is able to show peoples emotions and tell when people are hiding and masking their emotions. It is a new peice of technology developed by Prof. Thomas Huang, and Prof. Nicu Sebe. This product is revolutionary in many diffrenf ways. It not only valuable to a modern day life, but it also could have many real-world and technilogical applications.

The FACS system is a new and valuable peice of technology that has many interesting and strong applications. Like it was said im the text, it could adjust an assignment for a student to make it more engaging for them. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (D'Alto). That would make teachers lifes easier, and have less annoyed and out of control students, because they would be doing an assignment they would want to do, and not be extremely bored throughout class. Another way this could be valuable is for when cops do lie detector test. They would be able to pick up movements in the face that could show them that they are lying, or not telling the whole story. There are also many real world applications for this technology out there.

The FACS made by Prof. Thomas Huang could have many real world applications that would make life easier or more fun for some people. One of the many real world applications for this system would be Police Videos. You would be able to see the emotions on the criminal's face while he was being recorded on video, helping the police aid in the investigation. Another brought up by the article could be politics. You would be able to see how the politician is feeling, or which emotions. You would also be able to tell if they are faking emotions they are emitting while they are giving a speech, or if they are outright lying to you. The article itself says ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful."" (D'Alto). The final point I want to bring up is how this could be used for therapy or working through yout problems.

The FACS system could be a great peice of technolgy for therapists to use, working posple through their issues. People could tell how angry or depressed you were actually feeling. It would be a good way to work through the problems you have been facing, because people would know how you are feeling. The machine is able to sense the emotions you have been feeling, so people would be there to comfort you and work through your emotional turmoil. It would make venting about your problems much easier, and less hard to agknowledge

The FACS system is an important and valuable peice of technology for people to use that will most likely become valuable in the near future. It has countless applications, from Police work to Emotional Therapy.

1039122,"Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth.

Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditios by staying up and out of their way.

At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees, but the iar pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable.

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various form of life.

Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.

Astronomers fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system.

Venusiam geology and weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent ligtning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even to Mercury is closer to our sun.    ",1,3.0,,":**

103ff95,"Although Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin Venus has another name titled the Evening Star, because of it being one of the brightest points in the night sky, it's considered on of Earth's twins, and it's atmosphere contains carbon dioxide.

It is one of the brightest points in the sky because it looks like a star, although it is considered a planet. It is also the second planet from are sun in our solar system. The nickname ""Evening Star"" is misleading since it is actually a planet.

It is often considered to be Earth's twin becaise it, in terms, has the same terms of density and size and is occasionally the closest planet in distance. Since Venus is right around the corner, in space terms, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on the planets cloud draped world. Each of the previous missions were unmanned, and that was for a good reason, since no spacecraft could survive for more than a few hours there.

Most of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide. What is even more challenging is the cloud that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid, which are also located in the atmosphere. The temperature let alone would kill a person right on contact. The temperature is 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than what we have ever experienced on are planet.

So although Venus is a pretty cool planet, it can be a dangerous on too because of the misleading name, the planet being considered Earth's twin, and for the atmosphere being outragingly different than ours here on Earth.

10416ad,"Nonverbal communication is often used more than verbal. The way someone stands, moves, or sets their face can tell others more of what they feel then what they are told; however, these social cues aren't always understood. Technology is impacting the world greatly and the Facial Action Coding Software may seem like just another gadget, but it could change the way of teaching to specialize for individuals. Though the thought of computers identifying all emotions is slightly unsettling there are many benefits that may clome along with the software.

In schools, there are many students who struggle with the cirriculum because they do not understand the way it is being taught. From the teacher's point of view, it may look like they are not engaged because the aren't interested in learning the material. It may actually be because they are not understanding the material. A face that looks bored is usually a straight mouth and dull eyes, a confused face could look similar but with furrowed brows. There may not be a noticable difference between a bored face and a confused face that a teaher can spot especially while looking at many faces at a time.

According to the article, the software detects facial movements and compares them to a nutral face to calculate the percent of an emotion someone is feeling. Having this software in classroom computers could benefit both the students and the teachers in many ways. Along with modifying the lesson, the computers could collect data of how a student was reacting during an assignment or during a lecture and then notify the teacher or professor about the results. If many of the students are confused by what is being taught, the teacher could re-word the lectures in a way that might be more clear. If the students are becoming quickly bored of the material then the teacher may need to make some assgnment a little more challenging. The software can also show the teacher when students get exited about certain topics or when they are frightened by an assignment. When assignments are turned in and the result is bad grades, many teachers may assume that the student isn't trying their best, but there may be many other reasons why the work wasn't what was expected. With the facial action software, the teachers would be able to understand why the student didn't do the work properly. If they were confused then the teacher could suggest way to understand better, if the student was bored and didn't try, the teacher may talk about the importance of grades.

Even if this software isn't able to be avalible in schools, learning about facial actions and cues can benefit everyone. The article give instructions to make a happy face by highlighting points that are present in a naturally happy face. Learning instructions to making the faces of many emotions can be a helpful tool in classrooms and in many other environment when communication is needed. Emotions are a very personal thing and it should be the person's choice whether to show their emotions or not; however, this technology in class rooms may improve the teavhing style so that there aren't as many kids struggling to pass their classes.

10b6508,"Imagine a day where there will be no driver at the steering wheel of a car, problems would eventually arise, specially if there are accidents and people don't know who to blame. Driverless cars that exist today are not entirely driverless, they someone who can take comand if there are traffic problems or construction ahead. Everyday technology advances more and more, some companies believe that in the future there will be cars that opeate by themselves without the need of having someone there incase of a problem, some companies even have a prediction for when such cars will come out into the market. Driverless cars shouldn't be on the road.

First of all, Driverless cars shouldn't be be on the road because they will not be able to operate correctly if there is a problem in the raod. Driverless cars today still need someone there incase there are problems in the road that only humans can take care of, how will a car know what to do in this type of situation, they don't think like people. There are situations that could happen while a driverles car is on the road that sometimes can not be foreseen, therefore the car cannot be programed for such situation. Humans normally know what to do if there are roads constructions ahead or there is something on thee road, like a ditch to avoid, and in these situations how can a car 'see' what goes on in the road. Even if the cars were to have sensors for the outside, what about the inside, if there was a problem with the passanger the car wouldn't be able to tell what to do.

Additionally, driverless cars shouldn't be on the road because how would law apply to them. There are many accidents that happen in the road every day, law is applied in this situations to know who is to take the blame and what to do.

In the situation of a driverless car it would be dificult to pinpoint how law would apply to them, if an accident were to happen, would the manufacturer or the driver be the one to take the balme. There isn't even a driver in this car, and sometimes technology malfunctions occur, so no one could really take the blame. With time anything can malfunction, but if an accident that involves death is to occur how would the problem be managed if there is only a car, technology, to blame and take resposibility.

Most importantly, driverless cars shouldn't be on the road beacuse there will be too many expenses. If there would be driverless cars in the future, how much would you be charged for being taken somewhere by such a car. In today's world there is almost always a cost in order to get any type of service, the drverless car would, most likely, have a cost in order to be used, and at first that wouldn't be cheap. A driverless car would steal chaufers jobs, and sometimes those jobs are all that sustain some people, so this car would make many not have a way to get paid. At first when this cars are being constructed, how will they be paid for, each city would probably have to spend a vast amount of money to get this cars so they can start operating.

In conclusion, Driverless cars shouldn't be on the road. If these cars were on the road there will be too many expenses, how would law apply to them, and they won't be able to operate correctly if there is a problem on the road. There will be many problems with these cars, and conflicts will be harder to slove with them. If they are released into the market, a person should first think of all the things and conflicts that may arise just because of one car before using it.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of driverless cars and provides some relevant examples and reasons to support its position.

10fe8cc,"I think that having driverless cars is the most ignorant things i have ever heard. Since when do we put out lifes on the line just so a machine can drive itself. What is going to happen when a dder runs out in the middle of the road and your little driverless car doesn't vibrate or beep in time for you to react and instead of just hitting the deer, the car makes its own choice to swerve out of the way putting your life in even more danger. I don;t believe that there is a technology that can just make choices and stuff on its own. Why not try this type of expierement with trains first and still have the conductor on board just

in case anything goes wrong.

I will admit, at first it struck my attention but the more I kept reading on and on about how there driver still has to be present during the drive because the car doesn;t know what to do when there is an accident or construction going on up ahead. Yes, there are idiot drivers out in the world today and yes they have caused a lot of accidents butI would rather there be a idiot driver out there compared to a machine that thinks on its own but only has to have a driver present. Think bout this, in the article it stated about putting cameras in the vehicle to keep an eye out on the driver. Well sadly, whether you like it or not nobody will pay full attention in a driverless car, people will get way too comfortable and start texting or jamming out to the radio. For example, people don't even pay full attention nowadays in their own car going down the road in full control.

I think the whole camera idea is the most ignorant part about it. If you are so worried about what the driver is going to be doing and keeping you safe from getting sued, then I suggest that you don't even bother wasting your time and money trying to make this car work. Even if they did have cameras on the inside and outside of the car, what do you think would happen if a little kid or a deer ran out right in front of you and the cars little fancy cameras didn't have time to pick it up and brake. Whos fault would it be? In my opinion, it would be the manufacteres fault because if they tell me oh this car is great, it's a driverless car annd when there's a curve coming up and the car doesn't decide to turn and goes off the road putting my family and I's life in danger. I'd sue the manufacturer for everything they had becuase they lied to me. The choice is yours, buy what you want to buy. All I am saying is to make sure it is what you want and that it will keep you safe!      ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument against driverless cars.

111b844,"More companies are pouring in more and more money trying to make the perfect driveless cars but pursuing the driveless car is a negative thing for car manufacturing should not be pursued. Developing driveless cars could make driving easier but is a neagtive thing becuase there is a big safety concern, it can make driving boring, and it still requires the assitance of the driver.

Driveless cars have huge and complicated safety risk. Driveless cars are not perfectly save and can cause major problems when driving in places with construction or complicated traffics or complicated driving routes and if the driver does not take control of the car, the driver and the passengers in the cars and other people can get seriously injured. Driveless cars are so doubted for their safety that certain states have limited the use or banned them from being driven or tested in their state roads, a few states who have done this is Calforina, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Driveless cars who notify people when to take over if the emergency are still not that safe as they have no effective to notify the driver that he should take over, many companies have tried different techniques but none of them have found an effective way to get the drivers attention in case the drivers needs to take over because the car cant handle the roads or sencario it is in. Without an effective way to get the drivers attention, to take over if the time is needed, the car can have an major accident because the driver attention was caught to take over the car and the car couldn't handle the situation, leading to an accident. Even with accidents the problems do not end their, many people and car manducatures and companies do not know if you blame the driver or the manfucaturing. With this not settled out, you getting in an accident because techonolgy an compnay has put in a car was incapable of handling safe driving could make you be blamed for the accident and making you pay alot of money to fix your car and damages while the company who put this faulty techonolgy in the car, walk away with no problems. Driveless cars are dangerous and can be hazardous to the driver and the people around the driver and also leave you to deal with the consequences of an accident.

Driveless may seem cool at first, being able to drive all by thereself and not needing the help of any real person but what does that do to the driver. With driveless cars it makes driving cars for the driver boring. Driving without driveless cars was a joy and something people love to do but with driveless cars it ruins the experinece as you do not get to control the car anymore and just have to watch it drive itself. This has been a big problem for car companies as they have to get people to buy their car and enjoy the ride and the car and companies do not know how to do that. Werner Huber who is the BMW project manger said that with cars being able to drive by themselves they have to find new ways to attract and make the costumers enjoy the car and they can not find a way to do that without putting the driver adn the passengers at risk. The only things they have founded to make the car enjoyable to drive with driveless cars is entrainment systems or texting but all these may be enjoyable to the driver but also puts the driver at risk.

Driveless cars are cars that are suppose to be able to drive by themselves with nobodies assitance but that is not true. These so called driveless cars are not driveless car but are cars that can do basic functions of driving but when anything hard pops up, the driver has to drive the driveless car. This is a real problem becasue having a driveless car should mean that the car should be able to drive without the help of the driver but they can not and make the driver just sit there in the driver seat, staring out the window waiting and getting bored, so they can drive the driveless car when it is in a hard driving condition and if they do not do that they are in risk of a harazardous accident. One of the most technonlgical advances car made by BMW, is a driveless car and is suppose to be driveless car but is it really, the car can only handles speeds up to 25 miles per hour and any faster and the driver has to take over and even when the car is driving itself the driver needs to keep his or her hands on the steering wheel. These self proclaimed driveless cars may look like driveless car but they are not, they require as much assiatant from a real person as non-driveless cars do.

Companies all over the world are spending money to make the best driveless car out there but is it really worth it. Driveless cars are not a positive aspect to the automotive industry but is a negative aspect of the industry. These so called driveless cars need the assistance of real life human drivers as much or even sometimes more then regular non-driveless cars, these driveless car also are extremely boring to drive and ride for the driver adn companies can't find a way to fix it, and last but not least these driveless cars are hazardous. These cars can cause accidents, can not deal with hard driving, and can leave you with the consequnces of a horrible accident. Driveless cars might sound amazing and awesome part of the future but it is an negative aspect of the automotive industry and letting that negative aspect get s foothold in the future will be disatorous.

11428cc,"Although the year is 2016 and we were promised hoverboards, flying cars, automatic tieing shoes, and self fitting jackets by 2015, we arent exactly falling behind in the race of technology. With driverless cars we are one step closer to a much safer, and easier driving experience. In the not to distant future we wont have to make dad stay awake the whole drive to Disney world just to make it there on time. We no longer will have to hop in our vehicles when we are moving and have to go back and forth and back and forth from our old home to the new. Instead all that will be required of us is to pack the car full of items and ship out the car and have someone ready to unload it.

And watch out BP! With the new driverless cars we will being making half as many stops for gas than we have ever had to before! Last, but most definatly not least important is your safety. In the new smart driverless cars accedents are surely to drop a hefty percent. Keep your eyes on the horrizon, or close them and take a nap while the the car takes the wheel.

Everyone can relate to those long hauls to out of state, whether it be for vacation, visiting relatives, or work. The most memorable part, for myself at least, was wondering where we were going to stop and sleep, or if dad was going to just keep on driving. That will be something of the past in the not so distant future. As of now the cars we have can drive on there own.. Most of the time. There are still some trouble spots such as traffic jams, work zones, and accidents. In the previously stated mishaps the current versions of the cars will promptly alert the driver that there may be an upcoming event in which they will have to intervene.

Gas in the surrounding area currently is sitting around $2.75. From what I know the average car can hold somewhere around 30 gallons of gas. Lets say you fill up your tank and ride until its empty and then fill it up again, and lets also say that it takes you about a week to empty your tank. So on monday you fill it up for around $82.50. Come next weeks monday you need to fill up for another $82.50. In a span of two weeks you have spent $165.00. There are about 4 weeks in a month so that will be $330.00 a month. But you dont just drive your car for a month, so for a year you will be paying roughly $3960 a year! In the new driverless cars they can take that almost $4000 and cut it down to around $2000 since with the technology in the new cars you will be stopping in at a gas station about half as many times as you would be if you were driving in one of the old cars.

The complany Google has sent out a fleet of driverless cars already (with drivers in them ready to take the wheel at any given moment.) to help further the progress towards these great machines. They have driven around half a million miles (500,000 miles!) and are yet to crash. Google´s Toyota Prius is modified with position-estimating sensores on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. With this massive combonation of the latest technology we can say goodbye to blindspots for good!

Safety, luxery, money. All three of those are what the new smart driverless cars are offereing. It is almost our duty to open our arms to the advance of this technology. With Google at the helm of the team that will bring us the cars we need and deserve, they will be in the news quite soon.",5,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the benefits of driverless cars, providing some examples and reasons to support its position.

Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets around it. The temperatures on average is around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has more powerful earthquakes,erupting volcanoes and frequent lightning strikes.

It says that NASA is working on approaches for getting to venus. Like for example,simplified electronics made of silicon carbide has been tested through a chamber. A vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the ground but the surface would still be hot at around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Venus can sometimes be a good planetary visit. The planet has rocky sediments on its surface such as valleys,mountains and craters.

A phone or a tablet being exposed to acid could be heat capable to melting just imagine what that would be like. By comparing it with a system that uses mechanical parts the system can be made to be more resistant from pressure and heat resources. Many researchers cannot take gas or rock from a distance. Humans would survive if there is solar power from venus.

11ffe5f,"Dear state senator,

We all are here today to right a letter to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college, or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The Elector College process consists of the selection of the Electors, the meeting of the Electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. It consists of 538 electors 270 elector votes is requiredto elect the president.

So? witch one do I think is the best. I agree to keep the Elector College because things are running ok for now but it think the the people of the United States should have a little more say so in the disitions made in america because we are the american peopele and we have the right to speak are mind, and if we dont think somthing is a good idea we should be able to tell the congrees we dont belive in that and choice somthing eles that more people agree on. The only thing i see wrong with every one getting to have a say so is that not every one agrees with one another.

I do agree that a bigger population shold get more elector votes but i dont thing it i far but it is what it is and i dont have a say so im ok with it. the only thing i have to say is its not right that the bigger populated states get the most etention they are the most important but i dont feel its right all states should be equal no mater there population size.

I dont think that they shold change the Election of popularity because instead of voting for the right thing we could just vote for the presedent that is offering the best stuff, and when presedents promise us stuff it dosent alwasy men there going to keep that promise. they keep promises to every one and they cant keep a promise to one person with out breaking that promis to another person. like i sai i think the elector college should just stay the same way as it is with thoughs little changes because it is working. but things stop working at some point and when that time comes we will need a new system.                    ",1,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue, but it is not consistently supported throughout the essay.

The doctors and prof. say that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face;all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit. Also Dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

Dr. Huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication. Dr. Huang also gave some examples of what movments to do in front of a mirror. For example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second squint your eyes slightly,to produce wrinkling (""crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up,toward your eyes.

They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the Zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes.

Some people think technology is a great help to our daily lives such as computers, cell phones, and cars. However, there are many other people who would strongly disagree and say technology is ruining us. Either way you can stop technology from growing and becoming part of us.

Technology has advanced our cars in many ways. Many new things have been created such as electric cars, environmentally friendly cars, and now we are seeing driverless cars being created.

There are many positive aspects to having driverless cars. With the improvements in software cars can now handle more driving tasks on their own. These cars can steer, navigate, and brake themselves. They also notify a driver when the road requires human skills. When the vehicle is in danger of backing into someone the seats can vibrate to alert the driver. Some people just do not see the point of having a driverless car when you still have to help the cars in certain situations, but I think they are a great way to keep us safe annd focused. All of these aspects are examples of how the car can keep you safe and eventually lead to less accidents.

Transportation is a very important part of our daily lives. With the driverless car transportaion is becoming safer and easier. Drivers will be more alert and focused. This will decrease the amount of accidents caused by careless driving. In conclusion, I think driveless cars are a great addition to technology and transportation.

The new software has been developed that imroves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The software is the lastest innovation from the Prof. Thomas Huang of illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam.

Dr. Huanga and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans. In the fact these humans can perform this same impressive ""calcutation"" every day. LIke you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face. The Mona Lisa can really really bring back a smile to her face.

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huamg predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Those were some of Dr. huang predicts. The computer can write some simple instructions that can make Mona Lisa smile with different emotions.

While looking in the mirror:

* Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth.

* Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the coners of your eyes

* Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes.

25a6704,"I am agaisnt the devlopment of these cars. What would be the point of having a driveless car thats not really driveless. I am agaisnt the devlopment of these cars because it would be very expanisve to fix, does most thngs a human can do and driving problems may occur.

First, if the car was to break down and the sensors were messsed up it would be very expanisive to fix. According to the article, ""Totyota Prius uses position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever and an interial motion sensor'. If you were to get into a bad car crash and wrecked the car and wanted to get it fixed it will be super expansive. Mainly because all though sensors are high tech and advanced. So basically your fixing the car and paying for all the technology it needs which is going to be alot of money.

Secondly, the ""driveless"" car does mainly what humans can do theirselves. In the article it says after all the listed sensors, "" The combination of all this input is neccessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel"". It also says later in the article, ""They can steer, accelertae, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". If this ""driverless"" car can do what humans can do themselves then what is the point of making the car. Ecspically not if the car isnt really driving. Someone would pay all this money to do something they could have done themselves.

Lastly, with this ""driverless"" car driving problems may occur. technology does crash and does disfuction and may move faster than us. In the article it says, ""even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or manufactuer?"" The article makes a valid point. If those cars a developed those type of questions will need to be answered and conflict will occur. Technology can cause an accidnet just as easily as a human can but if that happens who is at fault? How would the situation be handled?

25bb264,"Dear Senator,

If you were to question U.S. citizens about what an electoral college is, what would they say? Most of them don't even know its a process established in the Constitution in which electors ""vote for president and vice president,"" and then are counted by the Congress (Source 1, paragraph 1). They don't realize that their votes can be over-riden by these votes. And those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed. They would prefer another system, a more modernized system, and are disgruntle about how unfair the system is, not only about how the electors are chosen but how the larger states have an advantage in votes and in information.

Most voters are opposed to such systems, according to Source Two, ""... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now,"" (paragraph 9). Yet we still have the Electoral Colleges going. As active voters in todays society, we call for a fair system. We want, no, we need, to be treated fairly and not over-riden.

We need a system us as people can control ourselves. As in Source Two, I will ask you the question, ""Who picks the electors in the first place?"" Certainly not the citizens as a whole, most of the time its picked by the state governement in some shape or form, but sometimes, even the presidental candidates themselves can pick them (paaragraph 10)! As well as in Source Three, where its clearly pointed out that ""... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people,"" (paragraph 15). It's outragous how easily they can pull the wool over our eyes, and even worse how we let them. But no more.

As you probably already know, each state's ""...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its Congressional delegation..."" (Source One, paragraph 3). Most represntatives spend most of their time campaining in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. ""In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all..."" and that campaign was refered to as a ""fiasco"" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute (Selection 2, paragraph 13).  This leaves the smaller states less informed and more likely to vote to the exact opposite of what they want, and yet they still have as much say in the vote. In Selection Three, it is said that the swing states (or larger ones) ""... are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates),"" (paragraph 20).

Selection Two points out something very important that should be stressed, ""... each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 5000,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 represantatives from California, who represnt 35 million votes,"" (paragraph 12). This shows the citizens aren't really being represented properly.

Altough many downfalls, ""The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose"" and ""avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,""(Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22). Yet still there can be holes poked in that, and all though unlikely, theres an even amount of votes so the vote could be split 50/50. Just imagine the chaos we could be thrown into.

Therefor, as a concerned citizen speaking as the voice of others, we demand a better system, for a simplerly system, for an equal system, for a system we can control ourselves. We demand for a direct system! So I ask, please, for you to speak to your friends, and speak out for your people, and put an end to the Electorial Colleges.

Sincerly,

A concerned citizen.

25ccf21,"Venus is a planet were scientis are explorig to see if they can create another Earth. Therefore they have than some experiments to see how long things can survive. There are many good reason why studing Venus is worthy. One of the reasons is because Venus is the closest planet to Earth, Venus still has some features that are alike to Earth, and solar power would be plentiful.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth,which can be an advanage because we could have a more population, and more place to travel and see different types of culture. In the text it says that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too"" this maens that the other planets are further than Venus. In text it also says that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"". This is telling us that we have more option to visit.

The planet of Venus looks more alike to Earth than you think some scientist belive that Venus had larges amounts of water. The text satates that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth .This shows us that this is why scientist are exploring this specific planet, because it look very alike to Earth. in text it also says that ""The planet (Vunus) has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. It shows us how similar this planets are.

Another adventage is that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Aaccording to the text it says that ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiatio would not exceed Earth levels"" This could help by not using electronics or else the materials would melt.

One important fact is that no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, but scientis are working hard they say that it won't be on easy conditions but it would be survival for humans. If there happens to be life in Venus the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.   ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent thesis statement.

26479a8,"After the nice, relaxed weekend at the beach, Steve gets up to go to work at 6 AM to go to work that is half an hour away. His Monday morning seems to be great until he jolt upright, suddenly remembering about the end-of-the-month report he was supposed to do over the weekend. Steve scrambles around his house, quickly changing into his work clothes and shoving food in his mouth as he runs out the door. As Steve drives to work, he tries to think of ways he can get the report done quickly, but he eventually prepares himself for the verbal lashing he will recieve from his boss. Steve can be anyone. Forgetting to do work is a common occurance. Steve, however, could have gotten the report done if he did not have to drive to work. A relatively new technology that could have saved Steve from his boss' rage is the driverless car. A driverless car, obviously, does not require a driver most of the time. Google and many other car companies have been trying to perfect the driverless car by making the car not require a driver. There are many pros to driverless cars that far outweigh the cons. Driverless cars are more safe and saves time for the driver.

Every year, many people die in car accdients, whether the victim was the driver or an innocent pedestrian. Driverless cars can potentially lower the rate of car accidents. Unlike humans, driverless cars can detect objects around them with multiple sensors installed in the car. The Google-modified Toyota Prius uses nine sensors - ""position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel,

a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"" (Paragraph 4). Also, the rotating sensor on the roof, called the LIDAR, makes a 3-D model of the cars surroundings. With all of these sensors, the driverless car can detect objects or people that a normal human driver cannot see, as there are many blindspots that a human driver has to be wary of. Also, the car can also ""cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine"" (Paragraph 5) based on the information received from the sensors. This gives the car ""better response and control than an a human driver could manage alone"" (Paragraph 5).

Although the idea of a driverless car sounds appealing, the current cars developed do not drive the full amount of time. The cars needs to alert the driver in special situations like work zones and driveways. Therefore, drivers need to be alert the whole time just in case one of these special situations pop up. If you have to be alert the whole time, why not just drive in the first place? Also, what happens if the car hits someone? Would it be the driver's fault or the manufacturer's fault? There are legal issues that can be avoided if humans just drove the cars in the first place like they have been doing for the past century. In addition to the legal problems and the drive time problem, the car can become faultly, like a computer that got a virus. This time, the consequences of faulty electronics are much higher than just replacing a computer. The car could end up taking someone's life.

The current driverless car does not drive the entire time. However,Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are expected to have cars that can drive of 90% of the time. Yes, there is a 10% chance that a human driver might have to take over but the 90% of the time that the driver is not driving, he or she can do work or just relax. Even if the driver fell asleep, there are many ways that the car can wake the driver up, like vibrating seats, sounds, and bright lights. Cars can be developed to become better at driving in traffc zones. The human instanct, however, cannot be developed to be more cautionous all of the time. Also, the legal issues do not present a problem. Laws often change to adapt with the times. Courts and lawmakers can debate on the issues, resolve them, and change the laws so that they can accomodate conflicts that the drierless car might present.

Driverless cars can solve many vehicle-related safety issues and lower the accident rate. Also, they give the driver more time to do whatever he or she wants to do. There are very little cons that come with the driverless car, and the ones that do come up can be easily solved. Driverless cars should be allowed to continue to develop so that eventually, they can replace humans drivers and make the roads mroe safe. Steve, too, can get a happy ending by frantically finishing is report while his new driverless car can take him to work.      ",6,4.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 4**

264856a,"Driverless cars could be the future of our generation. Many car companies have taken this idea and are trying to pursue it. They are cars that, eventually, will drive by themselves. It seems like a very creative and speechless innovation. However, there are many questionable aspects of the car that need to be taken into account. I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.

Drivers today have to go through intensive studying and classes just to gain a license. They think of it as the first step into adulthood and freedom. If driverless cars do take over our population, that will disapear. Teens will look past the greatness of being able to drive, and will look for another way to gain the freedom that they are desperatley seeking for. They also will not have anything that they are in complete control of. In the article it says, ""He envisions a future with a public-transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system."" If this happens, teens would not be in conrol of the car, the car would. That leaves kids to rely on yet another thing in their lives. Teens already have to rely on many things everyday. I think that if we add another one, and take away that sense of freedom, we will be taking away a big part of life. This is one reason I do not think driverless cars are a good idea.

Another reason I disagree with them is because of safety. Technology should not be relied on for big tasks like driving. Car companies are being thourough and making sure they are safe, but technology, even today, still seems to occasionally mess up. In the article it says, ""Most drvining laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" I agree that the best way to ensure safety is with a driver that is focused and knowledged. These driverless cars could potentially be dangerous to us. If the car messes up even once, or the company makes a mistake in the programming, we could definately be in great danger. Safety is the most important thing, and because we can never be 100% sure that technology won't mess up, we should not have driverless cars in the future.

The final reason I do not think that we should be excited for driverless cars is because of the law. If a regular car gets into an accident, we have laws that say who should be at fault. Also, it can already be complicated to figure out who should take the blame today with regular cars. If we all drove driverles cars, a new stack of laws would have to be made to support them. Getting used to those laws would be hard because we have never lived in the world of driverless cars. In the article it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a good point. If there is an accident where someone gets injured, not everyone will agree who should take the fall for it. There will be riots and fighting between manufacturers and individuals, and overall, it is not worth it. We should not destroy what we already have for something this risky.

These are the reasons that I do not think driverless cars should be pursued by car companies. I do agree that they would be very cool, but they are in fact, to good to be true. With the many complications that could come up, to the lack of freedom in teens, driverless cars take away more than what they could be bringing. Instead of investing in this innovation, we should use the investments to pursue more practical products, and to continue to make what we already have, better. Driving comes with a great responsibility that technology does not have. That is why I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.

26513d2,"Isn't it strange that cars are one of the most used transporting verhicles around? Well, of course besides busses, trains, airplanes, and all that. Almost everyone has a car, or adleast knows someone who does. Unfortunatley, in German Suburbs life goes on without cars. The Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" so the article says. They say car owner ship is allowed but there are only two places to park, large garages but that would take up to $40,000. Also, along with a home. 70% of people in the Vaubans family believe that life is better with out cars, of course they do not own cars. 57% sold a car to move here. In 2006 there was a growing trend in Europe, The United States, and else where to seperate suburban life from auto use. They call this ""Smart Planning"" Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States.

Vauban. Home to 5,500 people within a rectaugular square mile, may be the most experimented place with low-car suburban life. Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs spread-out homes and private places (such as garages, homes, etc) They were the dream towns of 1950s and still and exert a stong appeal. But some new suburbs look like the Vaubans. Not only in developed countries but also in the developing world. The United States, the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communties. Meaning the lack of usage with cars. In previous bills, 80 percent or appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent go towards other transport. On Monday, motorists were ordered to leave there cars ar home or suffer a fine of $31. Amost 4,000 drivers were fined according to reuters. 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

They make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in Western Europe.

The days without cars started in Bogota in the mid-1990s. President Obama's goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions unvieled last week. The United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to the countrys rate in January 1995.

266c5f9,"Many years ago NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars, trying to get any photos of possible landing sites for it's sister ship known as Viking 2. As the spacecraft was taking these photos, they spotted a cohesive head. At first the scientists thought that it was probably just another Martian mesa, but the thing about this one was that it had very unusual shadows that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh.

Days later NASA let the picture out for the world to see. The picture went viral within days. This had become one of the most famous talked about things in the world. It appeared in books, magazines, radio talks, shows, etc.

There were very few scientists who believed the Face could've been an alien artifact, but photographing Cydonia became a major priority for NASA. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time. At this time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a picture of the Face that was very sharp and you could tell what it was.

On April 5, 1998 many excited and anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to show up somewhere. The image did pop up but it wasn't what the web surfers were expecting. Most people were dissapointed when they found out that the picture of the face they had been waiting for, turned out to be just a natural land form.

What I have stated proves that the Face is a natural land form. It may have looked like a face in the blurred picture, but we now know that it was just a landform.

26983cf,"In this article, ""The Challene of Exploring Venus"", the author is explaining the difficulties of researching Venus closer, and why it is near impossible due to the challenges the planet provides. The author states what challenges the planet poses, and how scientists are trying to overcome those challenges. The author also says why the planet is worth the risk of exploration. The author supports the claim that Venus is a worthy persuit for exploration, disregarding the dangers, because Venus has many similar geological structures and could have once supported life due to the planet's simularities to Earth, but the author doesn't provide much more evidence as to why it is a worthy persuit.

In the same paragraph, a few lines down, the author gives examples of the similar features of terrain that the two planets share. The author says that, ""Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" The author means to that the planet has simlar geological features, in the next line the author expands upon what those are. The author states, ""The planet has a surface of sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Through these two sentences from the article the author is contributing to reasons why exploration on the planet Venus is worth it, despite the natural dangers that the planet poses. The fact the two planets share similar physical characterists appeals the claim the author made about Venus being Earth's sister planet.

In the fourth paragraph the author gives a few reasons as to why scientists are further discussing the exploration of the planet Venus. The author says that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in the solar system, and it may have housed life at one point. In the second line of the paragraph, the author states, ""Austronomers are facinated by Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This peice from the article shows that researchers, or astronomers, are intrigued by Venus because of it's simularities with Earth. Then the author goes into more detail about what those simularites are, in the same paragraph he states, ""Venus was probably convered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth."" In this sentence the author expands upon what those simularites are, and how the planets are similar because of their attributes, such as the support of different life forms. The detail the author inserted into the article about the resemblance of oceans is significant because life is not possible without oceans, and Venus had them.

Both peices of evidence that support what claims the author made as to why research into Venus was a good idea came from the same paragraph. The other seven paragraphs of the article expand upon why exploration isn't possible, how scientists and researchers are trying to overcome the difficulties that the planet provides them with, and what dangers there are. Only one paragraph from the article supports why exploration is intriguing to scientists. In this paragraph, the author supports why exploration towards Venus is being chased, such the similar physical characterists and the possiblity of life. The author doesn't support that idea of further exploration to Venus adequetly because they don't provide enough claims. There are two statements supporting why scientists are facinated by Venus. Why studying Venus is a worthy persuit is a minor detail in the article, the author does not do a well enough job in supporting the motivations behind the scientists.

Driverless car can have the driver panick because what if the sound for the driver to know it's their turn goes out? or what if the car breaks down in the middle of the highway during rush hour? things like that can have the buyer second guessing on weather they should buy the car or not. The opposing side would say that, at least the car has sensors that can alert the drivers when backing in and out a driveway oe parking space, or that they keep the drivers alert on the roads when the driver gets to close to another car or too close to the back of the car.

Driverless cars has many ups and downs, they say that they create a sensor to where the driver has to keep hold of the wheel at all times no matter, also that the car can steer and accelerate it's self which makes it hazerdorus because the car can start to malfunction wrong to where the driver don't feel safe or it's holding up traffic. Maufactures wants to put cameras in the cars to make sure that all drivers are staying focused and not getting distracted, that would be invading privacy and other code laws.

Some say that if the was to get into a car accident who would they blame the manufactures or the driver? well, to say they can blame the manufactures because they created a car that drive on it's own and the car can stop or break down whenever and however, but they can also blame the driver because they may never know it could of been the driver lack of attention on the road. That would be the biggest concern for most people, who would be the blame if something was to happen and the driver or anyone gets hurt.

Also, Venys us the closest planet to Earth. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms and human have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world for good reasons.

274eaf9,"Throughout this article, the author is very thorough in explaining what the risks of traveling to Venus are and why they believe it would be beneficial to explore the planet regardless of these cautions. In paragraph one, the author introduces Venus and how it has been a challenging planet to examine. In paragraph two, the author introduces the idea that Venus is much more similar to Earth than we may have originally thought. The author states that while Venus is close to Earth, the atmosphere of the planet makes it too much of a risk to actually travel to and land on. While unmanned spacecrafts have gone to Venus and successfully landed, none of them survived more than a few hours on the planet. The author uses this statement to show one of the many risks of traveling to Venus. In paragraph three the author delves deeper into Venus's atmosphere and why it would be harsh for humans. They explain this idea well by stating facts about the heat, atmospheric pressure, and other environmental factors that make Venus harsher than Earth. In paragraph four, they pose the question, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" Within the paragraph, they answer this question by discussing the historical interest scientists have in Venus. They also emphasize the point previously made in paragraph two, that the close distance of Venus to Earth is a large benefit. As an extension of the environment of Venus- discussed in paragraph three- they add more information about the planet's environment. In paragraph five, the author begins to discuss NASA's plans for safer travel to Venus. They explain what NASA is doing in terms of research and projects, what future plans are, and how they can make humans prepared to withstand Venus's harsh conditions. In paragraph six, the author counters what was stated in the previous paragraph by explaining why NASA's plans would not allow for a complete investigation of the planet. The author claims that the risks of traveling to Venus should perhaps be thought of as challenges. By looking at this in a new light, or from a different perspective, the author supports their original claim that Venus is worth pursuing depsite risks. In paragraph seven, they return to explaining what NASA is currently working on and other approaches they are developing to study the planet. The author goes into detail about technology they are using and how this can be beneficial to creating a safe way for humans to finally land on Venus. The author then concludes the article by returning to their original claim that Venus is beneficial to travel to and explore by claiming it has historical value. This article is well written and supports its claims very well, as proven with each paragraph. The author's claim is well supported by the evidence they present and the facts they state over the course of the article.",3,5.0,,": The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue of exploring Venus despite its risks.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" each section explains the valuable improvements technolody is making; however, one can argue that this new Facial Action Coding Sysytem may not excel in the classroom. This system enables a computer to read the expressions of humans but this may not be as effective as it seems. The author explains that this system could be used in the classroom in order to benefit the students lessons. This may be effictive to some degree; however, the computer system can not understand the students thought process. The Facial Action Coding Sytem would not be as valuable in the classroom in order to read the emotional expressions of students.

The Coding System created by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe is a computer that uses a 3-D model of the face in order to ""claculate"" the expressions and emotions of a human. Prof. Huang and Sebe also collaborated with a psychologist in order to simplify the machine toread and code six basic emotions. These six basic emotions- happiness, fear, surprise, anger, disgust, and sadness- do not cover the overall nature of human expressions. This is already one fault in the idea. Students in any grade level have many different ways of expressing their feelings and emotions whether that be through nonverbal facial recongnition or body movement. The ""basic six"" would not accurately cover each expression portrayed by the user and it could lead to a simple, yet common mix up.

Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" When broken down Dr. Huang is stating that the system could replace a human instructor in order to teach the student based on his or her emotional reaction to the lesson being taught. This is not a valuable asset for stdents who may simply not enjoy the lesson being taught, whether they understand it or not. A common stereotype is that all highschool students are tired, which for the most part is accurate, whcih could confuse the system with the idea that the student is unhappy about the lesson. An honors student may then have the lesson simplified to a point it is no longer of any value to the learner. According to renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, ""Putting on a happy face actually Works!"" This is another reason the system could be easily decieved with false readings of a student. They could simply put on their happy face and a computer attempting to read the emotion of that person would not be ""calculating"" an acutal emotion. This would not benefit the student's learning process nor their social relationships.

Social relationships are a major part throughout school and this system would take a lot of the interaction away from students and teachers. Unable to help students, the social nature in interactions between students and higher authorities would be negative. Dr. Huang notes that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This may be true; however, taking away the interactions and basic knowledge of students manners could be harmful. Even though there are pros to this system, such as video surgery that make computer-animated faces more expressive, there is not a need for the system in an everyday classroom.

Facial Coding in the classroom would not benefit the stuents learning process or social interractions. There are myriads of ways to express emotions nonverbally without facial recognition. Six basic emotions may not accurately decribe the feeling of ones current stae of mind in the classroom, which could affect the lesson given to him or her. Social relatiosnhips could be lost when relying on a machine to determine one anothers feelings and ""putting on happy faces"" may damper ones ability to express their emotions. The Facial Action Coding System would not be valuable to the students in a classroom environment.

The author made really good points about why we should study Venus despite the dangers that it may hold.

The author talked about why Venus is worth studying.

It is said in paragraph 4, that Venus, long ago, may have been earth-like.

It may have been covered in oceans and supported life.

This is defintely interesting to think about.

If it was like that long ago, why couldn't Venus be inhabitable for humans now?

On Venus, we would have enough solar power, and radiation levels wouldn't exceed Earth's.

I think it would be fascinating to study venus even with the dangers that it may present.

Overall, the author did a good job at persuading people to want to study Venus despite the challenges that may be faced.

27c512c,"This argument of the face on Mars been going on since 1976. Many people and even some scientest believe it is craftmenship of no other than aliens. Their have always been stories about how so called aliens live on the planet Mars,or how there is life on Mars. I am here to ease your mind and tell you it is no more than a mesa.

Their has been alot of talk about the rocky terrian we call Mars. First off this isn't the first case of where a face has been captured. On a nother part of the Red planet there is an area called Cydonia. Their was an image of a something that resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. That was just a shadow giving the unusal look of the pharaoh. This proves that not everthing is what it seems.

Next after discovering that this unusal look for Mars was just a shadow creating the illusion of having a human face we were fasinated and had to indoulge ourselvs in more reaserch. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor had gone over Cydonia. Our magnificant team of reashers got a picture that was a wopping ten times sharper than the origional photo. We had thousands of people waiting to see what was on our Red Planet it was nothing other than... a landform.

Then after that find we couldn't stop there. We were so close and we were desperate to find the truth. So we had studdied the pictures,and yet still nothing. The face on Mars was no different than your common landform on earth. We were sure right there it was nothing more than a lava dome that has molded its form into an isolates mesa.

Now some might say that our picture we claim that is extremly crediable could be nomore than a fluke, and there could be aliens and a chance for a new civilization on Mars. Now for us we wish there was an acient civilization on Mars, but we can't hide the truth. Finally for our picture in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, and if their was any sign of life like houses,airplanes,or even Egyptian styled pyrmids you would be able to see them. This how we know our information is credable.

Now it seames the whole "" Face on Mars"" in movies, books, magazines,and radio talk shows were all false. That whole franchisement was a total bust. Now that you know the truth and the face on Mars was nothing but fraud i hope that you listen to the people down at NASA.

NASA couldn't/wouldn't hide something like aliens from us. They have all of the facts they need to determen that this was not done by aliens. They have done reaserch and test to determan that its not done by aliens. Aliens are just mithical creatures.

Mars has been empty for as long as we have been able to go to Mars. It is just the rock formation and the shadow giving it the affect of looking like a face. The pictures show it was just rocks. The first one 43 meters per pixel compared to the new image that spans 1.56 meters both show the same thing.

The Face has been in moves, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and more for more than 25 years!

The Face created by an alien is just a conspiracy theory. It is shaped like a face but it is the shadows that make us beleve it looks like a face. Do you think some how that aliens have made it so the shadows are alaways there so it always looks like a face.

2822b94,"Have you ever wonder if a planet from outer space is safe? Today we will be talking about venus. Studying venus isvery great experience for a human to do, you get to learn about other planet. In paragraph 2 the author said "" Venus is the closest to earth in term density and size,""but is the planet venus safe for us to travel?

Numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study. Venus is a very hard planet to find out. For humans to study if it's safe or not. In venus a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. It's not safe for a human to go there cause of the acid clouds which is unsafe atmosphere for humans to breath in. Venus is a lot hotter than earth it it is over 100 its going to be hard for humans to breath.

On the planet’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. If the temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit it's very hot in venus and it's very dangerous for a human to travel there. It maybe the closest to earth but the atmosphere in venus is very dangerous for a human body. It is easy for a human to study venus. It's hard to get information if you dont get a chance to visit venus you don't learn abouy it. They stated "" NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus""

They think that venus could've supported various forms of life. They are trying to state that venus could've have human life and animals and plants on venus planet but they are still not sure if it's safe or not. In paragraph 3 they stated ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" They said venus was probably covered in ocean just like earth. Which mean venus is almost same as earth. Some people could've live in venus but they wasn't sure if it's safe or not.

To sum all this up I think that the more human study venus the more dangerous information they will get. No matter how much they study venus it is not safe and you will only get more dangerous. Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. In paragraph 6 they said ""scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Scientists are willing to have a personal despite risks just to learn about venus. Venus is a dangerous planet but almost as same as a earth that we live in venus clouds are acid.

283ae2f,"What is Venus? Some people called the ""Evening Star,"" but not, Venus is actually a planet. It was nearby Earth but they have a safe distance between them. Venus had the hottest temperature of any planet, and human can't near the ground in Venus.

Venus had the hottest temperture of any planet in solar system, there had no any living things can survive. According to the article, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet......

Human cannot near the ground in Venus as the temperature and air pressure. According to the article, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray......

287b18b,"Through the development of driverless cars, there are many postive or negative aspects that can be contributed to their manufacturing. Overall, I beleive that with these developments and engineering that has gone into the manfucaturing of driverless cars, we have improved the safety of regular automotive vehicles and the standards that safety should be set at. While the development of accessories that are created for safety are commonly used in these driverless car, these safety measures can be used in development of everyday vehicles.

When creating the idea of driverless cars, many furutrists have come upon the idea that we do not need smarter cars; we need smarter roads. The development of roadways that General Motors and engineers at Berkeley tried to use were incredibly advanced. The roadways at General Motors provided the invention of an electrical cable that was to be embedded in the track, this would send radio signals to a receiver that was on the front end of the car. The engineers at Berkeley used magnets that had alternating polarity. With this new-found developments, these people created smart-road systems that worked incredibly efficently. With these developments that were made, the realization that smarter roadways may not be the correct option, but smarter cars truly hold the future. This lead to a new wave of developmental ideas.

With the development of smarter cars, automakers had come upon the manufacturing of accessories that would help everyday cars. While smart cars really do need an abundance of sensors, often times regular cars can be improved with these added. With the development of anti-lock brakes, the sensors were able to exhibit a better response and control compared to that of a human driver. The development of smarter cars has lead to furthering the improvements in sensors and the computer software and hardware that makes driving safer.

In 2013, BMW had annouced the devlopment od ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This vehicle was able to drive partially by itself, but int he event of work zones and accidents, it needed the assistance of human drivers. Soon, automotive companies realized that it was a necessity to have a way for a car to gain a driver's attention. Some of these companies had seat that would vibrate, an announcement system, and flashing lights on the windshield and other displays. Through this abrupt realization, manufacturers have begun the merging of these concepts into everyday vehicles.

Through the creation of driverless cars, we have made everyday cars safer and more reliable. They are now less liekly to cause accidents. If we further the development of driverless cars, who knows where the roadways will be in twenty years? We could have the ubiquitous use of driverless cars, perhaps they could become further assimilated, maybe laws will change for safer roadways. Perhaps our everyday cars will be the safest as can be. We really don't know, but so far, the develp,ent of driverless cars has seemingly revolutionized the automaking world and planted a new seed in everyone's minds about the future which only we can change.

In conclusion, because of the devlopment of driverless cars, we have made roadways safer with the creation that have come about through their manufacturing. Without the thought of using driverless cars and making vehicles and roadways smarter, there would be a lack of development in the technological safety of vehicles. There would be far more accidents because of the lack of ability to brake, which has been stopped since of the perfection of anti-lock brakes, and there would be a lack of ability for driver's to remain focused on the roadways without the development of vibrating seats in order to gain a driver's attention when they are veering off the road. They have truly revolutionized the car manking industry and the future that we will hold.",5,3.0,,":**

287ed5e,"I think the Electoral college is a good way to vote for the president or vice president because i think without the Electoral college, we wouldn't have anyone to vote for the president or vice president. We have each candidate running for president in our state and it has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the candidate political party.

I agree that most state have a winner take all system because it awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.

The word state refers to the District of Columbia. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. We help choose our state's electors when we vote for president because when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our candidate electors.

I think the best laid defenses of the system are wrong because some voters might sometime vote for the wrong candidate and they might sometime get confused about the electors. After Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, he won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. The disaster factor is the single best argument against the electoral college. I agree that most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidate don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidate at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. I agree that the it's official that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best agruments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The agruments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right. Abolish the electoral college.

I think the five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President was for its lack of democratic. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I disagree the advocates of this postition are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is ot democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors because we're not actually voting for the president, we're just voting for the slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However it it entirely possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections inn which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. I agree that they made the five reasons for retaining the Electoral College.

Some challenges that come with exploring Venus is that it has harsh conditions for human and and robots, but the NASA has been working on other approaches. Scientist would like study its surface because at some point in history Venus was somewhat like Earth. The author has answers for all the challenges that scientist have with exploring Venus.

Venus is the second planet from our sun which makes the planet the planet very hot reaching 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus also has a very thick atmosphere of almost 97% of carbon dioxide blankets, and as the author states ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our planet"" that pressure would easily destroy any metal. Another fact about Venus is that it has the hottest surface of all the planets in our solar symtem even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. So far scientist have been working on alternatives to explore Venus.

Humans have sent many spacecraft to land on Venus, but none of them have survived this shows why non of the missions have been named. but in recent times the NASA has been working on using electronics made out of silicon carbide because they had been tested in a chamber simulating the conditions of Venus. Another approach that NASA is looking foward to is sending ""mechanical computers"" this devices use gears and levers to make calculation and do no need electronics at all. Mechanical computers can be made more resistant to heat, pressure, and many other force unlike its counter part, modern computers, they can very flexible, powerfull, and quick, but they are more delicate being in extreme conditions.

Human survival can be possible in Venus with a space ship hovering 30 miles above the ground of the planet, the pressure would be very close to the one on Earth the temperature would be around 170 Fahrenheit also they would be plenty of solar power, and the radiation would no be more that what it is on our planet. In these conditions human life can be accomplish. Millions of years ago Venus was like Earth, how do we know? because Venus has features of Earth such as rocky sediment, craters and mountains.

The conditions in Venus make it hard to survive in the planet because its temperature can reach 800 F and the pressure is 90 times grater than what it is on Earth, life on the ground cant be possible on the rocky ground of Venus. Even though the conditions has very dangerous conditions exploration can be possible with mechanical computers.

2916425,"Dear state senator,

After researching the Electoral College process I find that the process should no longer be used. The process is not effecient for choosing the next US president and therefor the voting process should be changed to popular vote.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This makes the Electoral College not a democratic method for electing the president. This nation was founded on the belief of democracy, so when the government ignores the call for a democratic method for elections it is disrespectful towards out Founding Fathers, and especially to the citizens of the United States of America. Furthermore, state representatives may misrepresent a state, possibly by defiance. This has happened in the 2000 campaign where segregationalists defied the people and nearly succeeded in replacing the electors for those who opposed Josh F. Kennedy. Although defying the people does not happen often there is still the risk of repeating history to a greater extent.

Continuing, the ''winner takes all system'' causes states with smaller populations to be ignored. According to source 3, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Larger states are paid the most attention to by canidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention. In contrast, it can be argued that no single region can shift a campaign greatly, nonetheless a single voter`s vote.

The Electoral College should be rid of. The process is not democratic and misrepresents voting citizens in more ways than one. If voters were able to directly vote for canidates then more states would actively engage in the campaign and all people would be represented equally. It would lower the chance for downfall, and the chance for incidents to occur. I propose that the next presidential election should use the process of popular vote to choose the next president for the United States.

Please take into consideration my proposal,

2917d93,"Are cars necessary in today's society? Of course they are necessary. Now, are driverless cars necessary? I would argue that they are not. Cars have been around for about a hundred years, and not once has society put its foot down and demanded a car that drives itself. The driverless cars this article discusses are not actually driverless, they are not legal, and there is no telling what future problems may arise.

Shouldn't a truly driverless car not require a human at all? I personally believe a driverless car should be able to navigate itself without human interferance. If it requires a human, then what is the point of calling it driverless? In fact, all the driverless cars being created right now are designed to notify the driver when it approaches a work zone or accident. So, in case the need to have a human take over arises, an individual would have to be sitting in the drivers seat, paying absolute attention to the road, and await the moment the car will allow the individual to take over. Wouldn't that take away the nejoyment of owning a driverless car? I believe it is even more of a hassle than driving ever would be. A person would have to fight boredom and remain alert while doing nothing other than sitting in the driver seat. To all driverless car companies: driving is paying attention to the road, but the driver is actually engaged, making driving more interesting.

Not only are driverless cars not fully developed, but they are not even legal. Most states do not allow driverless cars. In fact, most states do not even allow driverlesss cars to be tested on their roads. The article only mentions four places that allow driverless cars, and they only allow limited use. If these cars are not even allowed by most states to out on the road for testing, imagine how long it would take to pass laws to get these cars approved.

A myriad of problems could arise pertaining to driverless cars. The article mentioned a very real problem in driverless cars: if something goes awry and someone in injured, who is at fault? These cases would resort in major courtroom battles between average people and multi-million dollar companies. Another potential problem with driverless cars is the change off between driver and robot. If the car signals the driver and the driver does not respond, then what would the car do? A multitude of problems could appear, and all automakers can do is hope they will be abloe to find solutions to these probelms. To quote the article, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Not only are the companies unsure of what issues will surface, but they are not completely sure they will be able to find solutions.

Driving has been central to the American way of life for a large span of time, and if manually driving cars has been working, why change it? Driverless cars have been beiong tested since the 50's, so there clearly is no rush in getting these cars on the street. Also, once these cars are available to the public they will most likely only be accesable to the rich. In time the driverless cars would be more affordable, but the original prices would be high. Driverless cars are getting attention, but as soon as the public knows they will only be for wealthy hands for a bit of time, the excitment will die down.

The system works, and it works well, so why change it? Driverless cars may sound high-end and futurisitc, but our cars now do the job well. Plus, there are hazads and roadblocks the driverless cars will have to overcome first. Should we really make state legislatures waste time debating the use of a driverless car that is not completely driverless? Driverless cars have benefits, but they are not street legal. I see no point in spending money for a car that cannot be driven in most streets and is not able to operate without a human there to takeover incase something goes wrong.

29ad56e,"Technology has been used for decades in education, from the basic computer to smart boards technology has been commonly used to improve the learning capabilities of students in modern times. The 'Facial Action Coding System'

technology has the ability to help professors and teachers around the world get more into the minds of their students and engage the students into a classroom where learning is not a unified thing, but more customized and free depending on student ability.

Firstly, with technology becomming more popular, an increasing number students are having the ability to learn through technology. Along with that teachers and professors around the world have had to adapt to the higher usage of technology and programs to teach their students. This program gives teachers and technology the ability to adapt to their students, and encourage even confused or fearful students to learn by engaging a learning environment where a student's computer or device could read and recognize the confusion or joy a student is undergoing while learning,and therefor helping the teacher know the students level of understanding.

Secondly, having a program installed into the lense of cameras in students devices would open up new insight to teachers. For example, if a student watches a video lesson in a History class and is confused by something then their teacher could find the question, or peice of video, and simply adjust the lesson to fit the demographic and understanding of that child. There are many benifits to this technology including in the home, if a parent were to have the ability to see where their child was confused or frusterated the parent could also take some time to cover the missing material. This also prevents students who are fustrated but are to fearful or anxious to ask for help to not recive the assistance they need. This technology could open up door ways for students instead of them being lost in the information, but this technology is still new. .

Finnaly, one of the main reasons students do poorly in the current education system is that the student feels like they are not reciveing enough help or that they are lost. With average class sizing being anywhere from 22-32 students, a single or even two teachesr cannot assist all of the students individualy, and this creates a problem. Using the 'Facial Action Coding System' teachers can register which students need help and those who dont and pay more attention to the students who need help. This would therefore increase the amount of students able to retain information and help the school. Being lost in a lesson wouldn't be so common of a problem.

In conclusion, the 'Facial Action Coding System' opens new advancments in the the education systems by encourgaing an environment where teachers could have the technology to know when a student was confused or not understanding information, and also giving the ability for teachers to construct a lesson to fit the children who don't directly understand. It also proves a good method for parents to get involved in their child's learning and help the student with direct problems at the root instead of complications with the entire subject. So yes, this technology is very vaulable to the education of millions of students around the world who don't fully grasp their teachers learning methods or are just confused.",5,3.0,,": The essay develops a point of view on the use of technology in education, specifically the ""Facial Action Coding System"" (FACS).

29cf025,"Why would we need technology to tell us someones emotions when we know ourselves? No, I don't think that this is valuable because it is basically a machine that does an action that we can do ourselves. It also may not even be as acurate as scientist beleive. Another reason why I beleive that this invention isn't valuable is because I just find it really scary how exact the numbers are that the machine gives even if the numbers aren't correct and how much of interaction is happening between the face and the software.

The first reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because we don't need a machine to do the job of reading expressions for us when we can do it just fine by ourselves. I know this because in the article they state,"" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday."" This shows that we can indeed read emotions of people all by ourselves. I also know this because the text states,"" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This statement is completely true, I know that I can tell when people are upset even if they aren't my friends or someone that I know. Finally, I know this because the text states,"" Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" This is true to a point because we may not be able to know when someone is feeling worried or frustrated but we know that something is wrong. That is not a bad thing when we don't know every expression on somoenes face becasue that gives us social experiences with other people to go and ask them what's wrong.

The second reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because scientists may beleive that this technology is accurate but is it really? I know this because in the text it states,""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This right here shows that if the muscles of the face aren't showing enough muscle for an emotion the software might pick up a different emotion. I also know this because the text states that, ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle(above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbiculars oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" I disagree with how they are training this software to recognize facial emotion because some people don't make a happy face when they are happy or a sad face when they are sad.

The last reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because it is really creepy on how exact the number can get and how much interaction there is between the computer and the face. I know this because the text states,""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Wow, to me that is scary. I would never want this software to read my facial expressions. I also know this because the text states, "" Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" Why would people want computers to take over little everyday things that we do? This is creepy how much computers have weasled their way into our everyday lives so easily.

In conclusion, I beleive that this software isn't valuable because why would we use a machine to do something that we can do by ourselves? Also because the information being received from the software may not even be accurate. Finally, because the software is just really creepy and scary to think about how much human and machine interaction happens daily and how much much we rely on them.

29d00ed,"Do you think that the Face on Mars is created by aliens? I think not, I think that the Face is just a natural landform. Just because there is a face on Mars doesn't mean that it is caused by aliens. It could easily be formed on its own on the planet.

The Scientist and I at NASA have discovered that it is just a natural landform from a picture the team got when they flew over Cydonia for the first time. There was never any alien monument after all. Skeptics, like you, thought that alien markings were hidden by haze, so the team went again to look for the face. The face was shown again, and so my team and I took another picture but with a different camera and realized if there was any life form on Mars then they would catch it.

So to there isn't any life form on Mars, actually the face compare to a butte or mesa. We compared the face to Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The face compares a lot to the butte and so that proves that the face was not formed by aliens.

2a26e9d,"The Facial Action Coding System is a coding program that can read emotions, some say this could help in the classroom to tell if students are ingaged in the lesson. This system was created by Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe, leaders in their fields of expertise.

The usage of the Facial Action Coding System in schools to determine if a student is getting bored, tired, or angry at a lesson could be very useful. If a student were to get angry or bored during a lesson they are more likely to not pay attention and if you are tired you may not retain the information as well. If your computer could sense this and alert the teacher or change the lesson accordingly then it would give students a better working enviroment and a better chance of doing well in school. This 3D construct could also help teacher's understand their students better and help them learn more efficiently. This can also see through a fake smile and know the students real emotions which is important in case the student is trying to fake it through the leason when they really need help. According the the professional Dr. Huang, he predicts that, ""A classroom somputor could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then is would modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

So in conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can read emotions and see the real emotions present. This could lead ot improvements in the classroom so that teachers and the computor can alter the lesson as needed to the specfic student and their needs. This is a good idea because it will improve the work enviroment created for students.

The Face is a natural rock formation. Evidence such as a picture taken on April 8, 2001 shows that it is nothing more than a mesa which are common in that area of Mars.

The picture was taken with a camera that had a higher resolution than the camera used by the Viking 1 in 1976. The pixels in the image had a closer meter spread at 1.56 meters per pixel to the Viking 1 with 43 meters per pixel causing more of a blur effect.

Others say that the Face is an alien artifact. They say that us at NASA are covering up the fact that there is life on Mars. Another thing they say is that on April 5, 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of the Face the alien markings were hidden by the haze due to it being winter on Mars at the time.

The final thing to say on the matter is that the Face is a natural rock formation. The Face was not created by aliens. The pictures prove that it is natural.

2a4ca7b,"Imagine you are a NASA scientist discussing the face seen on Mars with a person a person who thinks it could have been alien life form that created it. Do you think it was just a natural landform or do you believe in alien life form doing this? NASA believes it is just a natural landform. NASA made a discovering on Mars that they believe looks very much like a face though they say it is just a nartural landform many others disagree, there is not any life form on Mars, aliens are just theory, and it looks similar to the landform in west America Idaho Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain.

First, there is not any life form on Mars. NASA has not yet caught any living creature on Mars when observing Mars and taking pictures of it. They have not been able to find any other things to point toward life on the Red Planet. For example in the passage it says ""...you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...if objects in this picture like airplanes on the fround or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shack, you could see what they were!"". So this quote proves there is no life form on mars because they would have seen it.

Second, aliens are just a theory that has been around for years and years. The meth of aliens have been around for decades but still no one has ever seen one some may believe they have but mistakeing it for other objects or even seen them in their dreams and thought it was real maybe. In this example it shows that this is a strange find but could very well be just a landform ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first apperaed on JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" this was found in paragraph seven of the passage, saying there was no life form when they discoverd this picture of a natural landform.

Finally, some have said it looks like the natural landform MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho, west America. Like in this quote from the passage, "" That's lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."", proving it is just a landform and no more then that. Though this could open up another opportunity to discover is there lava or water on Mars.

Though NASA discovered this face and would of loved if it came from an alien

that was not the case, don't you agree? There is still no life form on Mars today, as for the theory of alien, and the Idaho plain land mark looked just like the landform on Mars, were all are fact to prove this was just a strange land mark of Mars.

2a7d71d,"Dear State Senator,

I believe that we should change the electoral college to election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The electoral college is in no way fit to be the basis of how we choose the president of the United States. This country was based of of popular soverignty and we should keep it the way that it always has been with all the decison makeing done be the people.

The electoral college is an overwhemingly unfair system to voters. The canidents will not spend any of their time in states they know will not win because of the winner take all system in each state. they only focus on the tight races and some of the states dont even get to see the campaign ads. Some of the states did not even see the candidates at all. The electoral college is essentially one of the most unfair things in the prospect that the candidates dont spend time in the states that they dont think will win and the states that they know wont win are not even privillaged enough to see the campaign ads.

In addition to being unfair the electoral college can cause serious damage. The electoral college have the power to go against the will of the people. Back in the '60s segregationists in the Louisiana legislature were almost successful in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. Also during that time some electors would occasionally vote for whomever they please and not vote for their party's candidate. If the electoral college were to ever go into a tie it would be given to the House of Representatives. During this time the the states representatives will be cating thier votes on behalf of thier state. The problem with that is that those representatives are voting on behalf of thier entire state and that means they are voting for who they want and acting like that it is something the entire state wants.

There are five ""offical"" benifits of having the electoral college. The benifits are certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and you avoid run-off election. All of these things are in fact true but what if you are willing to risk all of that just to be able to be the one who has a say in who becomes president. I know that they kind of do but in reality that does not really mean much if there is someone who is going to completly disregard my vote and do whatever he feels like doing. I know that all of those five benifits are important but isnt my right to have a say in whose president important as well?

Senator, the reason for my letter is that I want to have a say in who the president is going to be and the electoral college resticts that. I believe that the president of the United States should be elected by popular vote because this is America and in America we do what the people want and the people want change. We want the electoral college out and popular vote in.

Sincerely,

2aa01a0,"A future with driverless cars can have many mixed feelings. Driverless cars could help solve many issues, but in the same way cause just as many problems. Many companies have been working on driverless cars now for years, but none have a definate answer to a car without any help and opperational needs by humans. Not having a fully driverless car already can represent the struggle, and challenge of creating a driverless car in this era. So i believe that the creation of a driverless car is a waste. They can be dangerous on the streets, cost lots of money, and have no real need in this day and age.

Driverless cars have already been proven to be dangerous on the streets. Companies have not yet come up with the technology for a car that can self-drive; the self-driving cars need a person on the wheel for emegergencies. Also, these cars can brake, steer and move on there own but need the assistance of a human when challenges come in the way. They need special help, and require the driver who is already at the wheel to take over and navigate through work zones and accidents. Having a ""driverless car"" but with a driver in the driver's seat, with his hands already on the wheel, but not driving makes it reduntant. Why waste that effort if a driver is already in the current position to drive.

If companies are putting all this effort into driverless cars, why cant they put the same effort and money into a real world issue? A nice, new car can cost a whole lot of money, and at a low can run upto 25,000 dollars. So a nice, new car that would drive itslef would run upto even much more money than that. We already have nice cars that we can drive oursleves around in, and with no problem at all. We shouldnt be focused on making cars that would make us Americans even lazier by not having to drive them. Companies should instead put this money to helping find the cure for cancer, or fighting against poverty and homelessness in America or other countires. Better things could be done with this money, instead of trying to make Americans even lazier.

A car that can drive itself has no real need in todays age, people drive themsleves fine everyday around the world without a problem. Some might say that having a driverless car is beneficial by having the car drive you somewhere, but then go back home for another family member to use. That isnt a real need, because almost everyone has a car nowadays anyway. Also, you need to have your hands on the sterring wheel while the car drives so its really not an option. What if the car didnt need your hands on the wheel while driving? Well say something harzardous did happen on its way home or a car crash, and the car needed to alert the driver to take over. The driver wouldnt be present, and the car would shut down and not make it to its destination.

Driverless cars are meant to sound fun, while having fun riding in one. Instead, they can infact be a waste of time, all in determination to find a new product for consumers to buy. They can even be a burden to opperate in; adults and young adults learn how to opperate and safely drive a car, but they would need a new curriculum to teach how to opperate a driverless car. They would need to show what to do during your ride in a driverless car versus what not to do. There is even the possiblilty of needing a different license, and test to be able to opperate a driverless car. So why go through all this hassel, and complexity for somwthing new, when we already have a fully functional car now that fullfils our needs.",5,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and consistent point of view on the issue of driverless cars.

2aa5a24,"The idea of Venus being worth of pursuit, depsite its dangers, isn't completely outrageous. The author of this passage dives into this idea, stating a reason as to why Venus exploration should happen, and also stating reasons that it currently isn't possible. Though the author does touch on the ideas of why we should explore this planet, they do not give enough reason to support the claim, or at least enough reason and ideas to keep the idea circulating within the brain of all of the readers.

The author seems to use at least two of their paragraphs to give why we should travel to Venus, in a sense that we were able to do so. In Paragraph 3 they describe the conditions of the planet, adding that Venus has volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes just as Earth does. This is just the start of the author's biggest and only claim, which fully arrives in Paragraph 4. The author does so by adding more physcial features of Venus and almost putting them side by side to Earth's. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life..."", and adding that ""...Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Later on, they also state that Venus has recognizable features, such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author wrote only about how scientists would learn the history of Venus, and gave no reasoning beyond this.

Though displaying a solid claim, the author gives no further explaination to their only reasoning, and goes straight into talking about the difficulty of traveling to the planet. There are multiple things the author could have slipped into the passage, like the abundance of information that scientists would learn, opening further travel, and the creation of new technology. Scientists and man alike would obtain much needed information from exploring Venus. Not only would going to this planet tell us its history, just as the author said, but it would push us closer to the exploration of planets that sit beyond this.

The author described a trip to Venus as being one that would be no fun for humans, but if able to create technology to keep our explorers safe, there would be smaller and fewer limits on the places our explorers and scientists could go after. By picking such a harsh planet to start one of many trips, the work and energy put into a way to reach the planet would pay off more than the world seems to understand. Though the technology used to get to Venus would have to be updated depending on the length of travel and the conditions of travel,--snowy and colder climates or hot, tretorous terrain like Venus--it is quite possible to get more out of Venus than what is displayed.

Readers do receive great information from this passage, but the author could have been equipt to know more reasons as to why studying Venus would be a great thing for scientists. They did give the wonderous and plentyful reasons as to why it will be harsh to reach and remain on the planet, however. Despite this all, Venus is a planet to reconcile with, even if it means waiting the months or years it takes to make just the technology compatable enough to work with its body.

2ab69a7,"My position on driverless cars is that I am against it. Autonomous cars still need the driver to be focused on the road. The driver must always be ready to take control of the car in any situation. I feel like autonomous cars give a false sense of safety when it comes to driving one of these autonomous cars. The cars arent fully autonomous they still require the driver to have his hands on the wheel in case he has to overtake the controls.

One reason I am against it is because no road that we drive on is fully predictable, so the cars wont know what to do when some situations arise. Most people who buy autonomous cars think they dont have to focus on the road and just leave it all to the car. Thats false, thats what makes these cars dangerous in a sense. "" The can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill,"" this is the reason I am against it. There may be a time that the driver needs to take over and steer the car out of danger, but since the driver had a false sense of security, he/she wont have time to react. They wouldnt have time to react because they might've been doing something else in the driver seat thinking that the car will steer itself. This is why drivers should always be in full control of the car at all times, because no road is predictable and it requires fast human skills if any situation arises.

There might be safety precautions that can try to prevent you from falling asleep at the wheel. This wont help at all in my opinion. Since the driver isnt doing anything, they will feel tired and bored and close their eyes and sleep. If they're really tired they wont hear the warning signs about work zones or any other warning in that matter. Everyone is different, some people are light sleepers and others are heavy. ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" This will fail in some occasions. Say you're a heavy sleeper, and you dont feel the vibrations, and you crash into an object. Will that be your fault or the manufactorers fault for giving you a false sense of safety? Does the vibration have a setting to make it vibrate violently to wake the driver up? Does the vibration start happening at different distances depending on the speed of the car? Also how does one know the reaction time of a driver? These are the test they need to do to know how to make these cars safer. The reaction time of a person woken up from sleep is really slow compared to someone who is fully awake. Also how does the car recognize that a danger is going to happen.

In conclusion this is why I think autonomous cars is not good for the people. Its not safe for the driver who is moving at high speeds down the highway with a false sense of safety. Its not safe for pedestrians who cross streets not knowing if a human is controlling the car or not. Streets will never be predictable and the computers on the car will go off of predictability. Yes there will always be a traffic hazard everywhere you go, and the car might not know what to do and its up to you to get yourself and the car out of harms way. This wont happen if you're asleep at the wheel thinking the car will do it itself and you wont have to do a thing. I feel like if a person is wanting to buy a autonomous car, they will have to take courses on how to correctly use the controls and also what to do when theres an emergency ahead. They will have to know the fundimental things like dont fall asleep on the wheel, always be focused and looking for potentional hazards ahead. Always put your hands on the wheel whenever the car tells you to. Also the main thing they should focus on is to never trust the car to get you from one place to another without your assistance along the way. Thats why in think autonomous cars a negative thing.                    ",5,3.0,,":** The essay presents a clear and consistent point of view against driverless cars.

2af44aa,"The Debate of the Faces

A new technology called Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to show human emotions by facial expressions, is not valuable to students in the classroom. I do not think that a computer system to read the emotions of students is needed for a quality education. Students have been learning in schools without the Facial Action Coding System for hundreds of years, so why would the Facial Action Coding System help us now? The Facial Action Coding System could actually be unbeneficial to students in the long run. This system could make students feel uncomfortable and insecure about their learning.

The main reason that the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to students in a classroom is beause it is invading to the students privacy. The students may feel like their emotions are invaded by a computer that is constantly watching them. The Facial Action Coding System could make the student feel like they are being pressured and that their emotions for a certain day can alter their learning style. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsin a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"" (D'Alto). This shows that the system can watch the students' every move. Would you like to be watched all day by a computer that is reading your mood?

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System is not needed in the classroom is because many classes in school are taught by a teacher, not by computers. The Facial Action Coding System might not be used at all if the school is taught by a majority of teachers, which could be a waste of money and software. Dr. Huang says in paragraph 6 that 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Even though this statement is true about the Facial Action Coding System, many lessons in schools are not taught by computers, but are taught by teachers. The teacher could also probably tell if the students are bored or confused so they could alter their lessons. In paragraph 5, the author says that, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto). This shows that the classroom teacher could effectively alter their lesson based on the expressions of the students, just as the Facial Action Coding System could.

In some cases the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to the classroom and learning environment. If a student is taking online courses or a school is predominantly taught by computer lessons, the Facial Action Coding System would help students stay more focused.

The Facial Action Coding System is definetly an amazing invention to computers and reading facial expressions. Although it is a great invention, I do not think that schools are ready for a program that studies the students' faces. This technology should not be used so it can protect the students' privacy, make them feel comfortable in the learning environment, and make them feel like their lessons are not forced. Many schools are also probably still taught by a majority of teachers, whearas the Facial Action Coding System would not be needed at all.

2b89aad,"The author states that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. How well does this author truly show this? He shows how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, it's often reffered to as earth's twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks.

People from earth can see Venus just by looking up at the right place. The author states, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."" So from afar we can see it as a big ""light"" in the sky, kind of like a star. But Venus is not a star it is a planet. What he means by this is that you can see how bright Venus is from afar but what you can't see what it is really like close up. But if we dont know what Venus is like close up then how do we know it is Earth's ""twin""?

Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". According to the text ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the clostest distance too."" The passage also states, ""Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" So if Venus is so much like earth then why can't we send a spacecraft to Venus now? Well we tried and it didnt workout. There was a spacecraft sent unmanned because the spacecraft could only survive the landing for three hours. Venus today still have some features that are close to ours on earth. Could this mean it could become safe sometime? Doubtful. According to the passage, ""Venus is a planet that has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters."" So why do we need to get so up close to Venus even though it causes risks?

Wouldn't you like to know whats on Venus even if it could be dangerous? I beileve this is why the author suggest thst Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it precents. You may wonder what thoes dangers are. According to the passage, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" So why should we still go? NASA is finding a possible solution to the hostile conditions. According to the text ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hoveriing 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground confitions by staying up and out of their way."" It also states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means we would be able to see and get more information about Venus.

I conclude that because of all the new findings that this is why the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit dispite the dangers. If Venus is like Earth does that mean that what happened to Venus might happen to us? This is why we need more information. The author shows us how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, its often reffered to as earths twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks. These are very important to know when deciding weather it is a good idea to travel to Venus even with the dangers. ",5,3.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 3**

2b98752,"The United States has ways of being civilaized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. The U.S should stick with the Electoral College because its a game changer and trust worthy.

To start off the Electoral College is a game changer for Election Day. In the article "" In Defenese of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of  popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example, "" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". In this peice of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger then the popular votes. Now in the article ""the indfensible Electoral College"" which was written by Bradford has a different claim. Bradford states "" because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". From this Bradford wants to express that the Electoral College is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. But even thought Bradfort disagrees with the method, Bradfort still stated the obvious. In the article Plumer states "" taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plumer disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. Basically the Electoral College is just a big game chnager on Election Day.

Futhermore the Electoral College is just a trust worthy method to use. Also it was like the first method to be used. In the first source ""What is the Electoral College"", the author gives some great information. The office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. The reason is because each state has an Electoral college and those states are in differnet parties. If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican party. From the other side of Bradford again wants a comeback. In his article Bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refuesd to vote for their party's candidate"". Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. So the electoral college just gives people want they want from trust.

All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college  represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.

Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet. The author of the article is right about the exploration of Venus being a worthy pursuit.

The author of the article does mention how difficult it is to study Venus by bringing up the planet's harsh atmosphere in Paragraph 3. Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus. He also points out that Venus may have been a lot like Earth a long time ago in Paragraph 4. This doesn't just further our understanding of Venus, but it may also give us more information about Earth as well.

In Paragraph 5, the author mentions NASA's plans on how to study Venus. He does mention that those plans may have challenges fo their own in Paragraph 6. The author pushes to try those plans out in a realistic manner. The author being realistic with the reader, makes the reader want agree with him more.

The author mentions a lot of facts with another fact to prove it is true. The author did good with trying to get their point across because of all the points they made to back up his statement.

The reason I think the author did good is because the author seemed to know what they were talking about.

The author mentions how Venus is most alike to Earth. Also that is just one of the many statements the author makes. The author had also used other statements to compare to why we could go to Venus. The author even gave their own idea on what think is possible. The author uses plenty of facts to help his idea and what he/she is trying to say. The author even says how NASA is working on approachesto study Venus and that helps make the essay even better. The author does not see his idea as a risk and more as a challenge.

2c46fcc,"Venus is a place in space where astronauts may go to. Venus is has the hottest surface temperture of any planet on the solar system. Venus is the second close planet to the sun because Mercury is the first that is closest to the sun. Venus is sometimes called the Evening Star because it is one of the brightest points of lights in the night sky. Some people may think that that Venus is one of the most dangerous planet in the solar system.

On the planet surface tempertures can get up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what weve experience in our own planet. Venus has the hottest temperture of all the planets in our solar system. Venus is the hottest even when Mercury is closest to the sun. Some numerous factors have think that Venus is challenging planet for humans to study.

Humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on the cloud-draped world. Each spacecraft they sent was unmanned. Venus is the dangerous because no spacecraft they sent survived the landing for more than a few few hours. Im assuming this is why not a single spaceship touched down in Venus for more than three decades.

NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. They are running test on the surface because of the chaos that has happened. They are looking back on old technology which was called the mechanical computers. This was evented in the 1800s. The studying that they are having I think that it shouldn't be anymore problems with spacecrafts or anything going to Venus.",1,3.0,,":** The essay provides some basic information about Venus, including its surface temperature, proximity to the sun, and nickname.

Electoral College would be the best choice. Selecting the Electors,the meeting for the president and vice president,and the counting of electoral votes by congress is a better idea than 60 percent of voters  prefering a direct election to kind we have now. I understand that under the

Electoral College system,voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors,who turn elect the president. If you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry,On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 lectoral votes. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates,s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their reponsibilities are. At the most basic level the

Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state,canidatdes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.

Election by popular vote for the president of the

United States

Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney becausw almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie in a nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number,but it is highly unlikely but each party selcts a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes,but that was the first time since 1888 thats happened. there are five reasons for reraining the electoral college despite its lackof democratic pedigree all practical reasons not liberal or conservative reasons. A disput ove routcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote.                            ",1,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue of the Electoral College, arguing that it is a better system than direct election.

2ca50cd,"The future is full of new and exciting technologies, including the ""driverless car"". The idea of a car that can drive itself is exciting, but also very dangerous. Although there are precautions the companys have taken to prevent accidents, something could always happen, and no company has found the answer to who is at fault if there is an accident.

Driverless cars may seem like an exciting new way to travel, but there is not a way for the driver to completely relax. The driverless cars cannot drive where there is not a smooth course. If there is construction work or an accident the car can not drive, and requires the skills of a human, which makes the name ""driverless car"" falsely stated. The way the cars alert the driver that their assitance is needed, is just by annoucing that the driver needs to take over. This way of getting the driver's attention may not always end in success if the driver is distracted and not paying attention to the car or the road.

Why not have a human drive instead? The driver has to always be alert and ready to take over in a driverless car, so why not just drive normally? It does not make sense for a driver to sit in a car and wait until they have to take over and drive, and that drive may only take five minutes. It is pointless to have a computer drive and to have the person in the driver's seat be alert.

Driverless cars are also making it ""fun"" to drive in a car where a person is not needed nighty percent of the time. Some manufacturers are planning to bring in car entertainment systems, which is another distraction to drivers on the road. Also, not needing to drive gives people more opportunites to be on their cellphones, read road signs, or look at the scenary instead of the road. All of these distractions are giving drivers more reasons to not pay attention to the road, and will prevent them from taking over the car when the computer can no longer drive.

Driverless cars are dangerous, but they do bring some goods to the table. Driverless cars are estimated to only use half of the fuel that regular cars use today, which can help the environment immensely. They are a new and exciting way to travel and get around, and if all the drivers are paying attention, can prevent accidents because of the sensors and cameras.

Driverless cars are exciting, but they are dangerous and have never been tested in real situations, like a family going on vaction, or someone going to work. The outcomes are unknown, something can always go wrong, and no manufacturers know who will be blamed when something does go wrong. The cons outweigh the pros, driverless cars are dangerous and cannot be trusted to handle situations if a driver is not paying attention. Driverless cars should not be developed and sold.

2caa790,"I bet your wondering what a Electoral college is in your head ,

well an Electoral college is not somewhere you go to like a regular college but its a process ,

they established it in constitution as a compromise.

Its where they vote for presidents and vice president including the electoral votes by congress ,

Electoral college consists 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the president .

To begin with, every candidate is running for President for your state ,and each of them has their own electors .

After every four years presidential election is held on tuesday after the first monday ,

the fun part is that most states gets a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate ,

also your governer prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""

listing all the wonderful candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors .

This year most voters are expecting another close election in the population vote which winners could again lose the presidency.

Under electoral college system some voters don't vote for presidents but vote for a state of electors , if you lived in texas for an example and wanted to vote for someone named John kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry .

For the winner-take-all method of the award electoral votes induces the candidates just like in 2012 election .Obama won the vote and got 29 electoral votes ,a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in the campaign

Nixton in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 pecent plurality of popular votes .

Well the advantages of limiting car usage is that you can walk to stores that are closer near by, without the need to turn on your car. Mostly the primary car limiting factor is for not to pay for gasoline  and gasoline  taxes. In the United States the Eviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" comunnitiues to limit cars all around the world. The goverment expects buses and taxis to play a much better role on giving trasportation to citizens that cannot afford a car. The goverment says that 80% of the bills payment by them is going to fix highways and that only 20% of the other bills they use it for transport.

2d01aef,"The Electoral College is a process in which each person running for President has his/her own group of electors who are chosen by their political party. In my opinion I believe that the Electoral College should not be kept because,it's not fair that the citizens only get to choose who is their president and who his party choose as Congress, they should  be able to choose who helps the president run the country. The President basically just signs the papers that can pass a law but the Congress helps say if the law should pass or not.

People should be able also to choose who they want in Congress beacuse, people want a Congress that they know and trust to help our country turn into a better place. Sometimes the Congress only do what they want and feel is right. The Congress that the party choose may also be people that they like and believe will follow how they feel which may not be  how the citizen feel. I know 538 pepole are alot to vote for and add the president, mayors,and commisioners etc., but atleast we'd have the freedom to pick who we want to help run country and we'd also know they'd try and help make our country amazing. Even if it's part of the Constitution they can change it a little like they alot of other things in it.

In conclusion people should be able to vote because then we'd be able to choose,so they could feel better about knowing who is passing laws and fixing their country. I may be under age but, I know if I were allowed to vote I'd want to vote for who runs my country and who helps run it.                ",1,3.0,,": The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of the Electoral College, arguing that it should be abolished because citizens should have the right to choose both the president and members of Congress.

2d356a1,"The ""Evening Star"" as the author from ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" is another name for venus. Venus known for being inhospitable to humans has been subjected to debate if we should send more explorations to the planet the author of this article thinks so. The author debates that the value of going to venus is worthy despite the dangers and obsticles we face.

A point that the author provides is that Earth is similar to Venus and that we should conduct further studies on the planet. A point that the author makes quite often to show that we can learn about our planet based off learning from Venus, ""Today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters"" (Exploring Venus). from this peice of evidence it is clear that the author is trying to establish a link between earth and venus, That venus is very similar to us so it is worth exploring. Another example of the author connecting earth and Venus is when the author writes about what could of been on Venus ""Long ago, Venus was Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth"" (Exploring Venus). The wrtitter of this story specifically said ""just like Earth"" because his goal is to establish the scientific evidence that could be gained from going to Venus because it is similar to Earth.

Furthermore the another reason that NASA should send a manned mission to Venus is that it may be the only chance at a expodition to another planet. The author provides information on how close Venus is and how this can be crucial ""occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimnes we are closer to mars and other times Venus"" (Exploring Venus). The author provided this information to follow up with another quote that comes in a later paragraph. The author follows up on this saying that venus is our the closest planet to us and that going some place closer will lessen space time travel ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Exploring Venus). This is crucial to have considering that many other planets our very far away making them harder to get to and making them more expensive missoins. So when venus is closer this will increase the support of a trip to evaluate venus because it will be less expensive and easier to get to then a normal space exploration.

How do we finally explore Venus if its worth the pursuit the author describes this as being a challenge but one that we must overcome to explore venus. One way that NASA can over come overcome the challenge of exploring venus is by using technology that is old bulky but most importantly strong. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (Exploring Venus). This is an important peice of information the author provides to over come the challenge of going to Venus and that we can be saved by technology from the past. Another way NASA could send astronauts to venus is through a giant Blimp in the upper atmosphere of venus ""A Blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roling Venusian landscape"" (Exploring Venus). a blimp is very helpful when it comes to not burning alive on the surface of venus because it is to hot but this approach according to the author also has some set backs. ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal"" (Exploring Venus). This is important to know considering that the authors main point is that we need to actually explore Venus but this hinders us to actually do so which ultimately defeats the whole purpose.

In concluison Venus is a chaotic and hot place unable to support life but the Planet is also worth exploring. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" insist that going to Venus instead of other planets is worth it because the value of going to venus is worth it despite the challenges we face going there, the author presents this claim by explaining that, it is similar to Earth so we can learn about our planet as well as Venus. Also Venus is close so this can save time traveling to it and that we have to overcome challenges to get their but it is ultimately worth going.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates some critical thinking.

2d9517a,"I think that driverless cars is something that can potentially make driving a little more safe. Driverless cars are not completely driverless though because they alert the driver when they are needed to take over. Sensors used in cars are also beneficial because they can give information that can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine. Therefore, it allows for a better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Even though driverless cars can do some things on their own, the human driver must still remain alert and be ready to take over when necessary. For this reason, it is necessary for the car to be ready to notify the driver when a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, and the Google car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. These are both ways that can alert a driver when it is time for them to drive, which can help people to be ready to focus while driving.

In conclusion, driverless cars can be beneficial to us and help drivers while they are driving. The drivers of these cars must also be alert as well too. There are sensors and other developments that can help with this process and notify drivers when it is time for them to take control. Everything will not happen right away because it is a process that will take time to be sought through and manufactured correctly. So in the future, maybe we will see more driverless cars then than now and it will be a beneficial way to the driving in our country.

2daf910,"The Electoral College has been around for a long time. The Electoral College is a process which consists of the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, meetings of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the selection of electors. It consists of a total of five hundred and eight electors and a majority of two hundred and seventy votes are required for presidency. Electors are choosen by the candidates political party. When voting for presidential elections, you are also voting for your candidates electors too.

When the presidential elections are complete the govenor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all the candidates who ran for President and the names of all the electors and it also tells who won the presidency and the electors that will represent your state. The state conventions, state partys central comitee, and the presidential candidates, all pick the electors.

Even though the electoral college is such and organized process of completing task; it is a disaster factor, it is unfair against voters. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to be choosen. It can be argued that the electoral college methods of choosing electors is bad. Obama is the president of the United States. Romney is a republican that went against Obama in the presidential election of 2012.

2db6925,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that the exploration of Venus is worth its risks. In the article, they state that it would be worth investigating because there is a potential that humans could survive there, but not without its challenges. The author provides a fair amount of evidence that states Venus could be an issue to gather information about. Overall, the author provides a contradicting article and is somewhat difficult to understand what side he supports, exploring Venus or to not.

The author provides reasons that Venus should actually be looked into. The reasons the author provides are: the geographical conditions on Venus used to be similar to what Earth has today, that the planet is the closest planet to ours, and could have at one point, ""...supported various forms of life, analogous to those on Earth."" The author doesn't provide a lot of evidence for any of these reasons other than the types of geographical features that are similar between Earth and Venus. The author does, however, provide technology-related solutions to the problems relating to how we could explore Venus. The author provides blimp-like, manned vehicles that could get within 30 miles or so above the planet. The author also provides simplified electronics made of a material known as, silicon carbide that could survive three weeks in the conditions that Venus has. The author then concludes his reasoning with how, ""... human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This simply means that we're just as likely to do something as risky and fear-inducing as exploring Venus and that we shouldn't be imaginatively contained because there are dangers that could possibly limit our expansion.

While the author has some reasons supporting the exploration of Venus, they have provided many challenges NASA, or any other space program, would have to overcome and downfalls to the planet. The author provides reasons such as: no aeronautic vehicle has been able to survive the landing for more than a few hours, the planet's atmosphere is almost 97% carbon dioxide, the temperature is 90 times greater than Earth's (800 degrees Farenheit), the pressure on the surface is enough to crush a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans, and how our use of modern computers would be limited due to the extreme physical conditions that they would have to withstand. The author provides an abundance of, somewhat, overwhelming reason that we shouldn't continue to proceed exploration of Venus.

While the author provides some good reasons to explore Venus and what it contains, they also happened to contradict almost every reason with why it would be a bad idea to pursue it, which is fairly counter-intuitive. The author perhaps meant to give these reasons to warn us and for us to bear the information of how it could go wrong, or how it would be a struggle and then come to terms with the idea that it would still be a good idea to explore Venus. But again, its also comprehended that the author themself doesn't want us to explore the planet. I feel that the author clearly portrayed the distaste that the exploration could bring and less clearly of why and how it would be a good idea.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue of exploring Venus, but it is somewhat inconsistent and unclear.

If you were to put the vehicles away and walk or bike to school or work, you would burn a lot of calories. Not only would you help yourself in that way but you would help the enviorment in many different ways. It might take more time to do stuff without a vehicle but it will help you more in the long run. There are limitless advantages to using other forms of transportation.

Walking or biking to school would take longer and it would take more of your time. But while doing this, you not only burn many calories but you get yourself in better shape. Continuesly doing this for a month or so would get you in top shape, making it easy for you to get to your location within the same amount of time as a vehicle. Doing this will help your body both mentally and physically while also giving your wallet a break on gas money. What's there not to love about getting in shape and saving money at the same time.

While saving money on gas, you would save the enviornment from the gas. Vehicles cause a lot of pollution and can even build a layer of smog over cities. These layers of smog get stuck in the air, making the area it's around warmer. The amount of pollution within the world is absurd, and if everyone were to stop using vehicles that would cut down the total pollution by a large portion. Lower air pollution is also shown to take away stress, and lowering the use of your vehicle would also get rid of the stress of other drivers.

The only negative thing about cutting down the use of vehicles would be the time it takes to get to your desired location. Riding a bike may take twenty minutes more, but think of all of the benefits in the long run. You lose twenty minutes from having to ride your bike, but you get to enjoy the experience of riding the bike and your body enjoys the benefits from riding the bike. The world is suffering from all of the pollution, and you losing twenty minutes to a simple bike ride would help the world last longer by a great amount. It may not make a big difference with one person but if everyone limits the usage of their vehicles, they could greatly help the world.

So why would  you not limit the usage of your vehicles? With all of the benefits you gain from doing so, you have no reason to not lower it. You could make a change for both your physical health and the health of the enviorment. The benefits of cutting down on the usage of your vehicles greatly outnumber the negatives. So what's more important to you, losing twenty minutes to a beautiful bike ride or polluting the enviorment and ruining the area you live in? There are no reasons to why you should not cut down on the usage of your car.                    ",2,4.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 4**

2e78299,"Should the world create new driverless cars? The world needs something new I think, I am for the development of these cars.

Why do I agree with the development of these cars? The world has been driving cars for more than 100 years, and I think the it's time for something new, the world is moving at a rapid speed of new and advanced materials, such as our technology, we need to develope these cars because the world would be up to date to where it has to be. There are a couple reasons why I think these cars should be made!

It's a new way of traveling and a new of seeing how the world can coast off this invention. Think about it, everyone has either talked about wanting to have flying cars or driverless cars, we can't get there if we don't try, from where the world is at right now, it is time for a new spice in the cabinet.

If these cars are developed it would only take up half of the gas a regular taxi would usually use, that's less pollution and that would help out the world itself drastically. Sensors are on the cars, that gives the car a idea of its surroundings and know where to go. Anti lock brakes are there and are always on because just in case of emrgency.

At the same time, there are its cons, such as if you were to get injured or to get in a wreck, who is to blame, the car company or the person in the car? If we did end up making these cars, these laws have to be established so everyone knows just in case if they were in an accident. Also, why would we want a car

that still may need human assistance if it's suppose to be a driverless car? That doesn't sound like the american dream, I mean it's getting closer but it's not where we want to be. Us humans can't relax when we get in the car if the car still or may needs assistance from time to time, we might as well just drive our cars if it still needs us to drive from time to time. We shouldn't be in a hurry if we still can't have a legit driverless car, if we need time, take the take time, I think the world would rather have a car to where the driver has to absolutely nothing, and can sit back and relax 10 years from now, then to have a car to where the car drives 75% of the time and you drive the other 25% next month.

I agree that these types of cars should be made but lets not rush, lets get it perfect to where the world technically not have to drive. Like the article said in paragraph 10, ""The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day.""

2e91de9,"This story is about evaluating The Challenge of Exploring Venus. In the first paragraph it is kinda misleading because it says that venus sometimes called the evening star is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Then it goes on to talk about how venus is also a planet so the name is very misleading. Then paragraph two it talks about how its a planet again not a star and its saying that its the closest planet to earth.

Venus is the closest planet to earth and yet to there has been a spacecraft to survive the landing. Although it could be a little bit tough seems haw venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. On venus surface the temperatues average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. With that kind of heat and pressure could even crush a submarine.

In conclusion the story had some great details about what venus was like compared to earth but i also think that it was a little misleading about star planet and i think that could have been fixed up so it didnt have you on your toes trying to find out wether or not it was a star or a planet that was earths twin.",1,3.0,,":** The essay provides some basic information about Venus, including its proximity to Earth, its atmosphere, and its surface temperature.

2e95e4d,"Since remotely times, the man had look for some way to make his life easier, since primitive hunting weapons, to carriages. The carriages were pulled by horses mostly, and on those times, the most that those animals could do for contamination was pooping but the owners had people to clean for it as well as someone who took care of it. While the times had change, the transportation media has too as well with the cars; which it actually result to be a doble sided blade contaminating with smog.

In Paris the government has banned driving due to smog, the smog has caused a huge impact on this city, giving to it cooler nights and warmer days, many habitants blame Diesel fuel, but it does not matter which fuel you would use, it would burn and produce smog anyways. On the other hand, Vauban, Germany, is offering a new life style that many people has decided to adopt; the suburbian comunity has no cars at the streets, people there does not own a car because they do not need it, the public transportation works very well, so it is not a primary need. They can live perfectly without cars, then they are not that necesary. Many people even sell their cars in order to move to Vauban, and had said that their lifes are so much less stressful than when they did own a car. Mothers can let their childrens to play in the streets without thinking that a car is going to kill them, and kids can let go technology if their moms want them to play outside; most of the kids are so attached to technology because it is a way that parents have to keep them away from the streets. Maybe these changes like in Germany were too radicals, but it can start by a day a year like in Bogotá, Colombia where once a year people take a car-free day, being buses and taxis the only ones allowed to produce smog, the violators are charged with 25 dollars fines. Even in the U.S., from 2003 to 2009 young people driving decreased a 23%, young people are considered the most dangerous driving people. There is so much for young people to do that they are not focused on driving, this could be the beginning of a new era, in April 2013 the number of miles per person was equal that in 1995 where the cars where less than right now. There it is even a program in New York promoting car-pooling!

But for example, here in Florida the public transportation is not that good, you actually need a car that drives  you to the bus station and then take the bus; a bus that will let you on a train station, that train station will offer you a ride of an hour to another bus that takes about half an hour to get to your job (if you live in Homestead and work in Miami). That is about three hours just arriving to your job, every day for five days in a row; that is about thirty hours a week, just to get to your job! But if you have a car, those three hours now are one hour, which seems reasonable (and it is still a lot!). If someone lives at Homestead and needs to do something (which is generally at downtown Miami or Doral) you would have to dedicate a whole day just doing it, if you are going in car because the distance between cities are ridiculous, can you imagine if not having it? For doing something you would have to take two days and do it by parts or wake up at the very morning when it is still dark so you can complete everything by the afternoon. So defenetly the car is a primary need.

Analyzing the life style that people at Vauban have, they are less stressed than the average person who owns a car; people starts to be more social with their neighbors because they have to walk everywhere and the faces are the same, so they actually get to know each other. They also got the benefit of a cleaner enviroment because they do not have the daily doses of smog that someone living in a city would have; cars cause the 12% of the contamination in Europe and more than a 50% in the United States. That is a problem that Paris maybe would not be facing right now if they had payed attention to contamination levels. Since World War II, science has been centered on developing new and better cars; can you imagine what would we have right now if some other would center the science in medicicne or something else?. In the United States an 80% of the budget goes to highways while just a 20% goes to public transportation. But, how can people in Bogotá or Vauben survive without cars? The distance between the comercial and suburban areas are close enough so a bus could take you there (just one bus). Defenetly, making the change would be hard due to our attachment to our cars, but little by little we can change or life style.    ",5,3.0,,":**

2ed047c,"Some think that driverless cars are in our future. Others think that driverless cars are, and should stay, merely a product of science fiction. I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea. Driverless cars are not a good idea for several reasons. The first and most obvious reason is safety. A second reason is the large cost of manufacturing these cars. And finally, a third reason we do not need driverless cars in this day and age, is people would forget how to drive a regular car or neglect to even learn if the car drove itself.

The first reason that society does not need driverless cars is safety. Of course, people can argue that if a car were to drive itself, there would be less accidents. It is true that driverless cars could reduce accidents from drunk driving and other impaired states, or just simple driving errors. However, some of these problems are easy to prevent now. It is illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The simple solution is not to do it. Most crashes caused from simple driving mistakes could be prevented as well. The problem is the driver, not the car. In addition, driverless cars would be at an increased risk for technolgical malfunctions causing potentially fatal crashes. As of right now, the technology in driverless cars is only experimental and theoretical. It would take many years to iron out all the bugs, so to speak, to make these cars function properly all the time. As mentioned paragrpah nine of the article, in most of the Unites States, it is illegal to test drive driverless cars. It is illegal for these very reasons. It is illegal because experimenting with that kind of technology is dangerous.

A second reason that driverless cars are not necessary is the unimaginable cost it would be to manufacture these cars. In addition, millions of dollars would be spent first to research and perfect the workings of the driverless cars. Not to mention, driverless cars would probably cost a larger sum of money than regular cars because of the time and cost of manufacturing them. In the past few years, in the United States has been going through a financial crisis. While our economy is now doing better, where would the money to fund these cars come from? In the article, the author mentions building smarter roads for cars. If that was the case, it would cost even more to fund this grand scheme. So much money is spent on paving and repairing roads every year, it would cost so much more to have to change or rebuild all of the roads in the country. In addition, if cars were to drive themselves, many laws would have to be changed for the new cars. Right now in the United States, one in five children will go hungry, there are clearly more important things to spend money on right now than to fund driverless cars.

A third and final reason that we do not need driverless cars is if we did, people would forget how to drive a regular car, or neglect to even learn. The article mentions that cameras might be needed to ensure people pay attention to the road. There are already enough distractions for drivers to worry about. Texting and driving has become a major issue in recent years. Imagine how easy it would be to be distracted by a phone or other device if the car you were in were driving itself? This is a slippery slope. It starts out with relatively small things, such as not paying full attantion to the road if the car drove itself. But soon, if people did not have to worry about traffic laws and safety, then they would soon forget them. Hypothetically speaking, what if someone who had been driving a driverless for a period of time one day had to go back to driving a regular one. This person may still have their liscense, but would they be able to pass a test for it now? Problems like this would make the road more dangerous than it already is. In addition, that same person who is now driving a regular car, may forget that he or she is controlling the car, being that they were so used to the car driving itself. There is enough reckless driving, that we do not nead people operating vehicles with no memory of how to do it! Or people might even neglect to learn how to drive a regular car at all if they depended on a driverless car all the time. If society allowed this to happen, the results could be catastrophic.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. Maybe in the distant future if more problems that we are currently dealing with are resolved, but not at this time. Driverless cars are not currently safe, and will not be for many years to come. They would cost a significant amount of money, money that can be spent elsewhere for better causes, especially when we already have cars that work perfectly fine. Finally, driverless cars are not a good idea because they could cause people to forget how to drive a regular car, which could lead to a very dangerous and potentially deadly situation. There are benefits of driverless cars, however there are even more downfalls to the idea that certainly outweigh the benefits.      ",5,3.0,,":**

2eecc01,"Driverless cars are indeed a very complex subject. In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", The text states that the car he forsees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer more felxability than a bus, Which would actually come to be very helpful in some ways. By using half the fuel of todays taxis the car would save alot of money for he who has it. Transportation as in busses and taxis, would not get as much business although it may seem like a good idea, Alot of the men and women who drive these public trsnportation devices would be losing their jobs if people decide to not use them anymore becasue there is self sufficiant cars and they would complt to being forced to try to find another job which they might not be able to get.

The Driverless Cars are built very complex. They use a ton of sensors all around the car which most likely takes alot of money to put into building, Money that is poribably taken from taxes the government collects from the people, Alot of people would be losing money to build something that isnt 100% sure that it would even work. The article says that these self sufficiant cars have been tested to drive millions of miles without crashing, and still would need some assistants to park and back up out of parking spots.

""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."", or so the article says in passage Eight. Some maufacturers hope to do that by bringing in car entertainment and information systems that use head on displays. Which can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over, But by doing this the driver would be very distracted by the displays and if the driver needed to ""take over"", they would be too distracted to do so in a life saving manner.

It is illegal to even test computer driven cars, not all states are willing to follow through with allowing it. It would take a long time to try and get all states on board with the situation. If the traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accciden, which will also take even more time to come up with those laws and get them passed.

2f3bda4,"Have you ever been faced with a boring computer assignment? Maybe you have dreaded coming to school or finishing your homework? As technology is advancing and more of the classroom is found through an electronic device, some students may find themselves losing interest in their daily lessons. What if this could be changed by a system that takes your facial expressions into account and accomodates to your mood? Right when the assignment has begun to lose your interest, this system could sense the change and alter the lesson plan to regain your interest. The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students.

Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons. Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow"" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student.

By the same token, using this sort of technology in the classroom will keep a student engaged during their lessons. When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, ""[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and further explains that ""[the system] could modify the lesson"" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can ""identify mixed emotions"" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged.

Finally, this system may change the ways in which many students view school. It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a ""fake smile"" and that to them ""faces don't lie"" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them"" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.

Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students. Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately. This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether. If you had the choice to experience in this program within your classroom, what do you thing the outcomes may be?

2f3c7da,"People have been driving themsleves since the early 1900s, and have done just fine.

Today cars have gotten much more advanced.

We have cars that can reach 250mph compared to back in the day the top speed on some cars was only 35mph.

We have cars that can brake on their own to stop a crash, but cars that can drive themselves sounds unreasonable.

It sounds too exspensive, and unsafe.

The driverless car seems to be unsafe.

The car uses sensors to detect its sourondings, those sensors are on the top of the car.

What would happen if something where to hit the sensors and break them.

The car could respond in a dangerous way and go off the road and crash.

The cars we have today are safer as long as the driver follows the laws of the road.

Cars today have been getting safer and safer for the driver.

The strive to be safer has become one of the main priorities for car manufactures.

The google car has so many electical features that are on the outside of the car and are most certainly water proof, but if it cracks and water getis into the eletrical parts the car would not function properly.

That would become a hazard to the people inside of the car.

This car sounds outragously exspensive!

Cars today are already exspensive, but a car that can drive itself sounds even more costly.

Everything that gets put into that car has to be exspensive.

This car has every advanced peice of technology on it.

The best computers out there today cost over 2,500 dollars!

For that much money people can go out and a buy beater car.

Today some people need a car like this, but may not be able to aford it.

People that are disabled already have medical bills and insurance to pay for.

A Google car would most likey triple the price of a good car in today's market, and nobody wants to pay that much money.

Eventhough there are many possible problems of the Google car, there are a few positives.

It could really help those who are disabled and are unable to drive a car.

Since the advancemet of the driverless car it could be very benifical to those who can't drive.

My grandma could use a car like this, because she struggles with driving and tends to get into a lot of fender benders.

However cars like this should not be made until they show that it can operate properly under any circumstance and any weather.     ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument.

2f7eae5,"Dear State Senator,

I think we should change our voting system. Electoral College has it's flaws. We know it's the traditional voting system. It has some unfair advantages. Allow me to explain and convice you to changing our voting system.

Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The electors could be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors will depend on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't always control whom thier electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfairto voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.

308be53,"Why The Facial Action Coding System Is Irrelevant

Sometimes people have bad days, and it can have a huge impact on others, but only if people choose to show it. Human emotion can be displayed in many ways. Some ways emotion can be expressed are through body language and facial movements/changes. However one chooses to show their emotion is all their decision, and it does not need to be known by everyone else. The Facial Action Coding Sytem is not valuable because it is a person's own choice to decide whether or not they want someone else to know how they are feeling, emotions are not relevant to students in a classroom, and there are not many ways that knowing emotions can benefit people in their careers.

A person's emotions do not involve other people. Although emotions can be caused by others, emotions do not have to be known by others. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", by Nick D'Alto, the author states ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" If a person can already make a guess on how someone may be feeling on their own, why would they need The Facial Action Coding System? This would be an actual waste of technology because it would be doing a natural job that a human can do on their own.

Students in a classroom are there for learning about subjects such as math, science, language arts, and social studies, neither of which involves emotions. Bringing The Facial Action Coding System into a classroom would be more distracting than helpful. Students and teachers should be focused more on the lesson than how one is feeling during it. In the article, it says that A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" In this case, students could also become very playful with the technology and trick it to access unreliable feedback.

Knowing emotions may benefit pychologists when wanting to understand the true feelings of one of their patients in a career based setting. However, in a classroom setting, reading student's emotional expressions is not needed. Some students may not enjoy school, but they are still required to go. The article notes that Dr. Huang adds Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This means that not only would The Facial Action Coding System be able to read the emotions of students, but it would also takeover the job of being a teacher. This is a disadvantage for teachers since they are there to answer any questions and do the lesson planning. This would also put many teachers out of a job.

There are very few benefits, there is no relevance for knowing the emotions of students, and any emotions of a person may not want to be detected, therefore The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable. Technology is supposed to be beneficial to humans and make life easier. The Facial Action Coding System does the opposite of that. Emotions should be revealed through a person's own wish, not through a computer. This could make many people very angry, due to the programming of this technology. The goal behind The Facial Action Coding System may be to read emotional expressions, but the emotions created, by people, from being able to do so could become very upsetting.

308e4ca,"Driverless cars are a dangerous thing that this society doesn't need. Driverless cars aren't completley driverless. They just stop doing their own thing as soon as they need the human help, this could cause accidents, tragic deaths, and lots of money from whoever is responsible. Are driverless, safe, cars really possible?

In 2009 the first ""driverless"" car could drive under specific conditions. It even drove ""half a million miles without a crash"". They still require a human driver to take over whenever pulling in and out of driveways. The driver also has to drive whenever there is roadwork or accidents, because the driverless cars aren't capable of figuring out where to go by themselves. The awesome cars on tv that drive all by themselves with no probelm really aren't a reality for us.

Some have hope that one day driverless cars may really happen, because of how far we've come with research and improvements. In the 1950s General Motors made a car that could drive on a special track, but the tracik was imbedded with electrical cable. This sent radio waves to the car to help direct it. Berkeley engineers tried something like this, they made it so the car could read positive and negative polarity in binary code. These experiments worked really well, but in order for that to work around the world we would have to upgrade every exsisting road. That's way to expensive and quite frankly to much to ask for such a new kind of technology.

In order to have driverless cars without changing every road in the world they would need lots of sensors. One sensor on the reer wheel, roof, rearview mirror, gps, inertial motion, and four automotive radar sensors. The combination of these sensors is supposed to mimic the skills of a human driving. We've used speed sensors before in the 1980s to create antilock brakes. These sensors over the time span of ten years became so advanced that they can detect out of control skids or rollovers.

In 2013 BMW developed a new car that has traffic jam assistance, they say the car can handle speeds up to 25 mph, but the car still requires the driver to keep hold of the wheel. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. These cars have been givent he ability to steer, accelerate, and bake themselves, but they all still need a driver to alert when they can no longer handle the situation. The driver has to remain alert at all times, and be ready to take over at a moments notice. Manufacturers are considering using cameras insure the driver is watching the road while the car watches the driver.

Some manufacteres and drivers are afraid that the driver will get bored with only being able to drive half of the time. So they want to provide these cars with in-car entertainment, but still have a way to inform the driver that they need to take over, and will instantly shut the entertainment off. Traffic laws are made so that a car being driven by a human is the only safe way because they have control at all times. Some states fear accidents so they have banned even test driving these cars. These states would include California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia.

Even if traffic laws were to change, new laws would still be needed. These laws would need to cover liability in case the car got into an accident, because the new technology failed. If that were to happen people fear there would be huge fights over who is responsible for the damage. The manufacter or the person who was ""driving."" Telsa believes the 2016 project will be sucessful because they are creating a car that has the ability to drive 90 percent of the time. Still the car is not driverless.

Driverless cars are more harm than they are good. Sure they may save money on gas, but they would require a lot more attention than a normal car. Driving in a normal car you know you have to be alert all the time. In a ""driverless"" car you don't, but If it were me i'd be more alert because i'd be afraid that all of a sudden the car isn't going to handle what's going on and turn the responsibility over to me. This would cause lots of stress and anxiety whenever trying to drive. Driverless cars just aren't something we need. ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of driverless cars, arguing that they are more harmful than beneficial.

309bd04,"Facial expressions and emotions drive the actions of people everyday. These emotions are sometime hidden, fake or very transparent. I believe that using this Facial Action Coding System in class rooms, will be quite valuable to the learning enviroment and education of idividuals. It will increase learning efficiancy, focus in the class room, and productivity of the students.

The Facial Action Coding System essentially scans your face for emotion and makes decisions based on the results. This would be very valuable in a classroom especially those of younger students and gradeschool. During school students can be unmotivated to learn, bored or confused in the classroom. These problems can waste time and cause students to not fully understand and learn the topic.

If this system can produce the outcome predicted this will lessen the amount of time, and help students to understand the topic more and at a quicker rate. By moving at the students speed and manipulating the lessen at points where the student is confused can be more efficient than the classrooms now. This system will eliminate the wasted time, bordem and provide solutions for those confused.

As well as increasing the efficiency, this sytstem can also benefit the classroom enviroment. When students become bored or unmotivated, they can become a distraction in the classroom. Teachers then have to take time to meet the need the student has. This disruption in the class can catch the attention of other students and cause them to stop working and or act as the other student is. Distractions like these cause learning to be hindered and if eliminated it can better the learning enviroment for teachers and students. This system, can keep students active and motivated to learn, providing less of a chance to be a distraction.

Furthermore, if distraction, bordem and unmotivation is eliminated or improved in the classroom enviroment, this can increase productivity. Students when bored or unmotivated essentially stop working, and students who are confused work at a slower pace. These problems cause the work that needs to be done, not completed or completed slower than neccessary. This system can keep the attention of students and create a path that the student learns at their own rate, thus completing the work that needs to be done ontime or quicker. This can benefit the classroom because teachers do not need to review topics that some students might have understood but others have not.

In conclusion this system is the most efficient, productive and helpful tool that a class room could be aquipped with. It eliminates bordem and unmotivation, causes more efficient learning and allows productivity in the classroom to increase. All teachers should implement this tool in their classroom if presented the opportunity.

30b779e,"What the Facial Action Coding System is a "" process begins whe the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more mucles is called a ""action unit."" The man thing is weather or not this ""Facial Action Coding Syste"" should be used to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valube . But there can be some good things about this and there can be some bad things about this. The pros is id the computer can read if the kid is strugling with somthing and the teacher could come help the kid. Also the computer can read if the kid is depressed and needs help with somthing going on in his or her life. The cons isinvasion of privice. But with all these pros and cons I think we should have the ""Facical Actions Coding System"".

My first reason why we should have these computers is for school. In the artical the author says ""A classroom computer could recognizewhen a student is becoming confused or bored."" What this means if a kid is stuggling or confused the computer can read that the kid is in need of help on the thing he is working on and the teacher can come help the kid. Also the good thing is if the kid is confused and needs help, but if the kid is shy or scared to ask qustions the computer can tell the teacher he or she needs help on what they are working on. Last if the computer knows the person in confused the computer can stop what the kidis doing and help that person on what they are doing. This is my first reason on why we need this computer system in all schools.

My second reason is the computer can read kids emotions and can help the person. "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of corse, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This shows if a person is depressed and needs help but is scared to tell anybody the conputer can tell that friend so that friend can help that person out. Also this can tell if a person is angry and the actions that person could do when they are angry helping that person out and other people around them, beacuse of the actions that person can do while they are mad. Last this device can save lifes of people who think of suicide beacuse the computer can warn peopel these sighns helping the person out and many more people. This is my second reason why all schools should have the computer system.

My third and last reason is the computer can help that person be happy if they are sad and depressed. According to Facial Feedback Theoryof Emotions"" Putting on a happy face actually works!"" Also "" imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnt."" What this is saying is if you are watching somthing and ad comes on and it makes you happy the computer know that you like if and it would more like that. But if a ad comes on you dont like it and frown the computer knows that and will change it fast so you stay happy. With this computer doing that it could keep a lot of kid happy. This is my third reason why all schools should have this computer system.

Some people my not agree with me. Some people may say that it is advading your privace. But I think the computer should beacuse the computer can svae lives. Also help kids learn. Last it can keep kids happyand not sad. With the computer doing all of this we can keep a healthy life style and a safer envoroment for every body. This is why all schools should have this computer system to save lifes, help kids, and keep kids happy.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates some critical thinking.

30be42a,"Driverless cars are revolutionizing the auto industry. This idea behind this futuristic technology is to allow the user to relax and not be bothered by the worries of the road. While this idea sounds nice in concept, when put into reality it just becomes illogical. It is for this reason that unless groundbreaking technology is discovered that can make driverless cars safe and practical, people should just continue to drive cars themselves.

One of the specific faults of driverless cars is the fact that they are not truly driverless. This is made evident when the author states that ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" (7). The whole purpose of developing computurized cars is so that no attention is required by the humans within the cars. If the human still has to be ""alert"" and ready to drive, then the entire point of having these automated cars is negated. The attention required by a human takes away from the ability to relax and not worry about the road. To that point, if the operator of the vehicle is not able to fully relax, he/she would much rather be solely operating the vehicle for the strict purpose of keeping occupied. If they cannot risk leaving the car alone to occupy themselves with other things, than the entire purpose of the driverless car has been defeated.

Another factor that argues against driverless cars is the issue of safety. While some may argue that the automation of the car takes away the factor of human error, this puts too much trust in the computers. While tested, and proven safe, it is still worrysome to think about the fact that the operator's life is solely in the driving skill of the computer that is driving the car. It is unrealistic to put this much trust into a computer preforming a predominantly human activity. Human knowlege, reactions, and skill are all key attributes in driving, which is why taking these attributes away may turn out to be dangerous. This is the reason that ""...in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"" (9). Things are not just made illegal without ample reason to do so. Clearly the United States government, the most powerful government in the world believes that there is too much risk involved in testilng, nonetheless driving these furutistic automobiles.

This idea of driverless cars follows the recent social trend of laziness. As a species we are beginning to rely more and more on computers to complete simple tasks that we are more than capable of completing ourselves. There is a point where technology is taken too far and that is the point where it has an opportunity to impact our safety. This is that point.      ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that driverless cars are not practical or safe. However, the essay does not provide sufficient evidence to support this point of view.

30c1119,"Dear state senator,

My letter is in regards to changing the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that we, the people, should have the opportunity to choose whom we wish to become President.

The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote. It's a big deal for people to go out and take action. So what would make the electoral college change one view of voting? Its the fact that we aren't really voting for our president. We are voting for our electors of the state, to vote for our president. And on top of that, there are still many people out there who don't have a clue that their actually voting for someone in our state to decide for us. Although the electoral college does help make the presidential election less complicated, it's the mere fact that WE aren't making much of a difference.

The electoral college doesn't only have a few minor set backs, but it could tarnish out dreams of who we wanted to be president by way more than we could've expected. When it comes to voting for electors, its a difficult thing when it comes to how many electors represent which political party. Democrat, or Republican. Say one wanted the one candidate running for president to win, and he/she were Republican. That person would go out and cast a vote for a slate of however many of republican electors there are for that state. The part that gets a lot of people is that there could be fewer Republican electors then there are Democrat electors. Say one still wanted the Republican candidate to win and they voted in their residential state which was Nevada. IF Nevada had 4 Republican electors then that meant anyone who voted for the Democrat electoral wasn't chipping in much to the election. In the end, all the electors votes are counted for each side, and because Nevada had only two dedicated Democrats, the chances of the Democrat candidate having less electoral votes then the Republican candidate, has increased. If this problem happenes for several other states, then the chances double, even triple.

If this doesn't make you think that the electoral college should go, then think again. The electoral college is definitely unfair to voters. Any chance of unfaithful electors, could happen. It could make one feel betrayed that they voted foe a specific elector to do one job. Which was to help select the president the voter wanted. Whats the point in putting your trust in someone who could just easily turn around and NOT vote who you wanted? There is no point. But that's what we're doing when we vote. We are making it an option for that to happen. So why not vote by popular vote? Why not avoid all the issues the electoral college can cause for us? We should be lucky that back in '00, that was the biggest election crisis and it COULD'VE been worse.

In conclusion, we the people, should have the opportunity to vote and actually have our vote counted. Because every state doesnt't have the sam eamount of people in each, the chances of there being a tie in the presidential election, is slightly unlikely. Other then there being a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the votes add up tp 538; an even number. We shouldn;t put ourselves through this, and truth be told, the election is confusing as it is. I say, we should get rid of the electoral college. It's not needed, and a pain.                         ",5,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue of changing the presidential election to popular vote.

30c179a,"Driverless cars, is this in our future? Driverless cars have become a growing topic in the past years. Recently, more information has become visible to the general public. Are these cars a good idea? I believe driverless cars are not needed in the near future. Development of these cars is an unneeded advancement in technology. Driverless cars, as of the technology we are now given, are not as reliable as an independent driver, they invade your privacy, and it would take more money to install technology in roads to be able to make use of these cars. Driving is a symbol of independence, in the sense that you are given the responsibilty and freedom to go virtually any location you please by driving yourself there.

Self driving is a commonly used way of transportation amongst many individuals. Driving is a way of transporting ones self from point A to Point B. When most individuals are driving, the average spped exceeds 25 mph. Driverless cars are only reliable for simple driving functions up to 25 mph. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars are completely driverless."" If driverless cars were to become a prominent part of every driver's life, would it be very practical? In the article, the author states what the cars are capable of, even with the driverless technology, the car will never be fully independent. The car is not completley driverless, this will be an unneccassary advancement until manufacturers create a truly driverless vehicle. So, using these new cars may be seemingly pointless, as the driver will still need to be paying attention and the car has sensors to make sure the driver is paying attention. This leads me to my next point, is a driverless car worth giving up your privacy?

Driverless cars not only have sensors on the wheels to make sure you are paying attention, they have cameras on your dashboard to ensure you are paying attention. ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" While some people may argue this is for the safety of the driver, there is no valid reasoning that there should be a manufacturer watching your every move to ensure you are paying attention on the road. Cars that have been driven that are not driverless have been doing, overall, well. While drivers are able to pay attention to the road regularly, having a camera creates an unwanted pressure to the driver. Adding the pressure of knowing you are constantly being watched as a driver can raise your stress levels, resulting in frustrated driving. Frustrated driving is an unsafe form of drivng, where as driving while relaxed and unwatched, relieves the pressure of knowing you are not the only person in the car. In addition, in the current days and in the past, has there ever been a need for manufacturers to put a camera in your dashboard to make sure you are driving safely? The answer to that question is no. Drivers, while not being watched, are expected to follow the laws and pay attention. Using cameras in the car and invading the privacy of the driver is an unneccasary addition, as there will only be use for the driverless portion of the car for up to 25 mph; therefore there is no further reasoning to begin developing these new vehicles.

If driverless cars are only useful for up to 25 mph, is there really any practical use for them? If driverless cars become the new form of transportation, there will be money involved that a lot of people do not have. Having smart cars requires smart-roads, ones that can communicate with the car to ensure the safest possible driving experience. ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" When manufacturers create these smart roads complementary to their smart cars, who will be paying for them? The most likely answer is a raise in already inflated car prices. When the smart-roads are installed, hypothetically speaking, will the road be smart enough to communicate with all different manufacturers types of cars? Will they allow regular cars to drive on them? How long will the instillation take and will it be on every road? These are all things that require time and money. Manufacturers see the big picture of driverless cars running the roads, but that simply can not be the case, given all of the obstacles needing to be overcome and all of the questions that require answers. With all of the money it will require to run cars that are still dependent on drivers, will there be any valid reasoning to spend all of this money on new roads and new car development?

With all of the advancements in technology, there should be a threshold to the items consumers want versus what they need. Manufacturers should not be trying to create new technology, but improving what they already have created. Using driverless cars, still require a driver to pay attention and take control after a certain point, invade your privacy by watching you with a camera, and require more money to create the new road systems and create new cars. In conclusion, I believe there is no practical reasoning that these cars should be further developed.

30f0911,"People go through many emotions in a day an hour or even a minute. Our emotions are changing constanly and we don't even realize. Some people try to fake their emotions to others and some people let their emotions out into the world. Emotions come in many varities mad, sad, happy, confused, etc. As people look at us they can tell wether or not were happy, mad, or sad. They could tell by looking at our facial expressions, the way we talk, the way our body moves, and many more. As technology keeps taking over our daily lives as the years go on, a computer has been made to tell the emotions of an individual. It can tell the emotions of people in pictures, painting, or even right on the spot. The computer is thought to eventually end up in the classroom to tell the emotions of students. It would tell teachers if the students were bored or excited so they could fix their emotions on the subject they might be talking about. This has brought up the arguement as to whether the emotion telling computer should be brought into the classroom or not. Their are many different opinions on this topic. The emotion telling computer should be brought into the classroom. It would be a huge achievement for every school around the world to have this device. The emotion computer should be the next best thing in the classroom.

The computer could tell if the students were bored or not on a certain subject. If classrooms did have the computer teachers could look at it in the beginning and the end of class. It gives the teacher the advantage to see which method of teaching bores or excites them more. If many students were bored one day change it up the next. Once students begin to be more happy as the teacher goes on the more the students will want to learn. Students who are bored will not learn a thing, but students who are excited will be interested in learning and will get better grades. The article states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr.Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""(Huang) The emotion telling could change the way the lesson is being taught to make it more exciting. The more students are happy and excited about learning the better the test scores and grades. Some may argue that a computer would not be able to change the way a kid is feeling, however, it could make the teacher change the way his or her students are feeling. The computer should be used in the highschool classroom to tell the emotions of students.

The computer could make students feel better and interact more in the classroom. The could computer could analyze the patterns of emotion in students each day. If a student has been mad or sad, the teacher could ask them whats wrong and try to fix the situation. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" The computer would be accurately precise on each students emotions. If a student was shown to be stressed or worried for a certain amount of days, a teacher could tell the parents so they could help him or her. The computer would help make many students feel better each day. Some may argue that anyone could tell the emotions of another, however, the computer could get down every single emotion in a percentage. The FACS computer needs to be in the classroom for everyone to use.

The emotion telling computer should be the next best thing in the classroom. The computer could do many things for students, parents, teachers, faculty, and many others, It can enlighten others to do better and want to learn more. Grades of students would be better, tests would be higher. Everyone would be in a lot better mood if we all had the computer. The Facial Action Coding System could do things no other would think was possible until now. The computer should be in every classroom; and you should urge others to consider making the computer the face of the future for every school.

30ff0f0,"The year is 2041, and astronaut Jeff Goudard has just landed in the region of Cydonia. He is extremly exited becouse he will be the first human to see the only alien artifact known to man. As soon as he lands, he sees the face. Jeff's jaw drops practically to his feet. He relizes the ""Face on Mars"" is really just a plain old mesa, just like the ones out in the American West. Now just like this astronaut, there are probably hundreds of people that think that the ""Face on Mars"" is some sort of alien monuent, but in reality science and logical thinking has proven that in reality, the ""Face on Mars"" is really just a Mesa almost identical to the ones found out in the American West.

First off is the logical thinking portion. In the region of Cydonia mesas are incredibly common.

Now this particular mesas is oddly shapped, I will give it that, but it is just a mesa. What gives it human fetures is just the shadows. Just look at 1976 Viking one photograph. You can clearly see shadows Just look slightly below it, you can see a long shadow protruding from the mesa. Now on the flip side, look at the picture captured on 1998 when it was cloudy out and there were no shadows at all. The image just makes it look like a weird rock, not like a human face at all.

While still on the topic of the photographs, the one snapped on 2001 also proves that the so called ""Face on Mars"" is really just a mesa becouse of not the actual formation, but the surronding area. It was taken by a very high quality camera. In fact, it's pixles spanned 1.56 meters whereas the best Viking photograph the pixles spanned 43 meters. That ment that you could zoom in around the area of the mesa to scan if there was any other evidence of alien life. So scienteists and analysts could scan the sourrounding area for pyramids or buildings, but they found absolutly nothing that would sugest that aliens are present in the region.

Lastly, lets all say that the so called face really was an ancient alien structure, why would NASA keep it a secret. I mean, NASA is really short on funding, but if it was proven that there was aliens on Mars, then that would mean NASA funding probaly would go through the roof. What better goal could NASA have then to make conatact with extratrestrialls. This must mean that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another mesa. What organization would pass up the opprotunity to get through the roof funding.

So just face the facts. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a mesa that had well placed shadows that are one in a million. So don't be Jeff the astronaut, and just face the facts early on as oposed to having high hopes and dreams just to have them crushed by even more scientifically proven evidence. If you don't remember anything from this article, remember this: don't be Jeff.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural formation, not an alien artifact.

317173f,"Driverless Cars are coming soon or later? People have argued that there are positive and negative things about this crazy invention. I see alot of negative things about this invention that is suppose to come into the world by technology. If the car would fail at a point

you could be injured, injured bad or death can occur, people have less experince driving and people will be more lazy then what they already are, and someone could even fall asleep because they arent incontrol of the car the car is incontrol of you and something bad could happen if your in danger and the car doesnt alert you like its suppose to or what if it doesnt?

What if the car fails at letting you know you are in danger and something bad happens is it your fault or the cars fault? If the car fails at telling you this you could be hurt, hurt badly or you could put your life at risk and you could die if your in seroius trouble. You cant depend on nobody or nothing but yourself. I feel like this could put your life at risk. Most people would like to drive the car not the car drive them. Technology could break down at any time you just never know when that time is. It may not work at its best like they say it will, at some point and time it will or could fail

People would have less experince as drivers do today and people would be more lazy. What if your in danger and your incontrol of the car now what if that person has lack of experince and they wont know what to do. They will be in danger and could really hurt themselfs or others. They could crash into another car or crash into smething. This invention is sounding very dangerous not just too me but many others. People are already lazy enough and they would be even more lazy with this invention. Technology is taking control over our world and this would be a big one. Some car accidents are going to happen in the world but i feel like most people are alert and focus already on the road and their surroundings.

If you arent incontrol of the car you could possibly fall asleep at the wheel and what if you need to take over? Then what? Something serious could happen and you could put you and others at risk. Most people want to be incontrol of the car and not have the car be incontrol of them. This invention is very dangerous and i dont feel like it would help our world today. If this invention isnt made i feel it will cause no stress and not alot of worries about the negativities that could happen.

Technology is taking over our lifes very quickly and thats not how it should be. I hope this dangerous invention doesnt come soon or later in our lifes we need to be resposible of being incontrol of the car at all times. This could cause lack of responsibility in many of peoples lifes. This invention is very dangerous. I hope many others see alot of negatives i see in this invention that might happen in the world I would like to see and many other would like to see more people come together and argue that this is dangerous and shouldnt happen in our world. We shouldnt want to be control by technology. Bad things could happen to you, mine, and others lifes.       ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument.

318dac4,"Luke bomberger wants to become a seagoing cowboy. He really wants to become one. He crossed the Atlantic ocean 16 times and the pacific ocean twice to help people by World War 2. I got that off in the beginning of the story. In paragraph 4 it says that he had made nine trips-the most of any seagoing cowboy. In paragraph 5 it says luke also toured an excavted castle in crete. So far he is going good and he also became a seagoing cowboy and he is doing great. Helping out his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work nut not for dangers at sea. On luke's second trip luke served as night watchman. Luke had a little accident and he could not work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs but he was glad he made it out alive. Luke had wonderful time's and then bad one's but he always worked hard to become and seaboy cowboy and so far he is doing pretty bad right now because he broke his ribs. Luke also found time to have fun on board. Being a seagoing cowboy was being more than an adventure for luke. It opened up the world to him. Luke bomberger said ""I'm grateful for them opportunity"". He wanted to be a seagoing cowboy it was his dream it was all he has wanted to be and his dream came true he was the most wonderful seagoing cowboy he was hard working and he made it look fun. He worked hard for his dream and he has made it come true. He has done wonderful things.

He has helped the people that needed help.In all these paragraph there is a short pharagraph about what he done or what he was about to do.

At first he was working two part-time at the grocery store. That is were he was and used to be and that is were he was working. But now he has an even better life. So this was about Luke bomberger and his wonderful life and how he helped and how he used to be after he became a seagoing cowboy. What made luke love seagoing so much how did he get into it what made him love it so much what made him want that and not other things. I mean he started out at a grocery store the he land in begin a seagoing cowboym I guess he enjoyed that the most because he reallly done a lot of great things in his life he has gone done places he has basilly wanted to do. He has gone places he has wanted to go he has done things he has never done before. I mean if I was luke I would be so happy for myself and what I have done to have such great gift.

Now that his dreams came true in begin a seagoing cowboy. Well he has a good path on his way he still has a wonderful jorney to go on.

He has earned great stuff and he also deservet because out of his old life he has a whole life up a head no that he has got what he wanted he is going to try and keep it. He is going to work hard and be the best he can at everything. Luke omberger got what he has always wanted now he has a great life on his way.

Also one more thing if you have ever thought of going to a different country an speaking multi languges well you get do that on a daily bases. And it is very fun ihave some reasons why it might be fun to you.

It is very fun so if you like here some reasons to get you interested. you can play animals and if thta isnt fun i don't know what is.

In the article ""The Challenge of exploring Venus"" the author talk about the distance between the Earth and Venus. Also he wrote thing refering to the tempeture on Venus and comparing both temperatures Earth and Venus. And then he talk about how the NASA is working to study Venus.

Venus or sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" is considerate a planet. Venus is the planet closer to Earth, but also Mars is another neighbor from the Earth planet. ""These differences in speed mean that somethimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus"" said the author. This is one of the reasons why it may be a new place for humans live.

The temperature is appropriate for humans. In the article the author show us the planet's surface temperature, it has an average over 800 drees Fahrenheit. He also indicate that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater, ""It is more than what we experience on our own planet"" he said. He discover that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system. In other words Venus has become a great option to life.

""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus"" he said. Personal who work for the NASA and has the mission to study and understand Venus have obtain amazing results. One of the results is that the conditions are not easy, but survivable for humans. Machines contribute to their knowledge of Venus, ""those machines make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all"". This study of Venus has comverted on a challenge for humans who have the curiosity to know more about this planet.

31be4dc,"I think that they should do voting by the popular vote because it should be what the people feel most comfortable choosing and they shouldnt have the electoral college. It can be argued that the electoral  college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas for example or republicans in california knowing their vote will have no effect they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by popular but of course no voters vote swings a national election and in spite of that about one half the elgible american population did vote in 2012 election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote in 2012's election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney .  . . . because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number but it is higly unlikely .....

I think those two paragraphs from this passage explains why i would like for people to just do popular voting because it makes the people comfortable and who they feel will make a america as best as it can be. That person who is being elected should feel proud and make america safe is what i stronlgy agree and i think others should to because it is a great choice. The elctoral college consist of the selection of the electors the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress and i feel like thats a little too much when people can just vote instead of getting someone as a president who their not comfortable with or familiar with and dont know anything about the person so everyone just vote by the people for the people.

31c2e4e,"To the State Senate,

Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popular-based vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fufilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, ""...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"" (3). This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place"" (Office of the Federal Register, 1). This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well.

According to Plumer, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" (2). This indicates how the tie could carry the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement takes place of voting for the president. Not only this, but Plumer also stated,""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" (2). This statement from Plumer strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House of Representatives would hardly reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gore recieved a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fair? This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumer stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters...swing states..."" (2). This brings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winner-take-all system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance of winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer,2). This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed.

Now, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the ""...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone's President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid Run-Off Elections..."" (Posner, 3). These subtitles are points that Posner focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winner-takes-all method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" (3). In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Run-off Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (3). I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President?

31e4327,"The Challenge Of Exploring Venus

My Claim that

support the passage is "" Do Not Judge A Book By It Cover"" despite the facts that venus is one of the brightest points in the night sky, it was simple for amateur stargazer to spot. Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and closest in distance. The only difference between the venus and earth is the speed because sometimes we are closer to venus because it is always around the corner.

No spacecraft has ever survived landing on venus. Venus is marked as the challenging planet for human despite the promixity and the similarities they both share. There is 97%

carbon

dioxide which bblankets venus and it is more challenging due to the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure in venus is more greater than what we experience on earth and also it has the hottest surface.

According to Paragraph 4, the astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. Venus was for once looks like earth which includes different oceans and some rocky sediments which partains to mountains and valley. Eventhough venus is no more condusive for human being it is still consider as one of nearest option for planetary visit for humans. NASA are compelling ideas for sending human to study venus. The possible solution for NASA to study will allow the scientist to fly above the fray. If blimp-like vehicle hovering above the venus was created this would be of help to the astronants to complete their research because the vehicle won't come down to the surface of the venus that low, but there would be a lot of solar power and radiation so that the condition can be survivable for the humans.

If a ship orbiting safely above the venus is created this wouid

help to provide some insight about the ground conditions because most form of light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere so this will render any form of photography in effective and also things cannot be picked from the surface of the venus, so with this scientist is planning to conduct a thorough

mission to understand venus would need to get up close despite the challenges they're going to face. According to

paragraph 7, NASA is working on other approaches to study venus examples are some simplified electronics made of silicon and also using the mechanical computers to study the surface of the venus but using a modern computer can be delicate because of the the risk it entakes.

Finally, for scientist to study the Venus they need to create some powerful equipments that can be of help to them. Venus is large but due to the risk, it is made difficult for scientist to study it.

326c204,"Luck Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Don Reist his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

He said yes right then he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke signed up with his friend Don.

Before arriving in Greece, Luke turned 18 years old, which meant he could be drafted for military service.

When his draft board learned he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to keep doing that for his service.

By the time he was discharged in 1947, he had made 9 trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for Luke.

Besides helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work, but not for dangers at sea.

He couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke.

It opened the world up to him.

He is grateful for the opportunity.

It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

The awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

32aedc2,"Changing The Future

Times are changing. Driverless car technology is being created, with slow and steady progress. The technology for these type of cars has only been developed over the last few years because of a lack of technology. There are several companies trying to develop these cars, but they're pretty much at the same step. Knowing how driverless technology works, who is liable for damages, and how it will effect drivers is crucial to the possible future use of driverless cars.

Driverless technology has to be understood by the consumer. If the consumer does not know how this technology works, it could cause some serious damage.

The consumer has to realize that driverless cars aren't completely driverless, the consumer has to know that they have to remain attentive while being in the driver's seat. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" (Driverless Cares Are Coming paragraph 7). Without the realization that they have to be attentive, some bad accidents could occur.

Liability for the accidents caused by driverless cars has to be settled. The companies that make the driverless cars, or the driver, it is yet to be determined who would be at fault. The company for making flawed technology, or the driver for being in the car. ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturere?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 9). This will be a huge issue if driverless cars do become legal. Driverless cars could effect the people in more way than one.

The effect of drivers in the future if cars become driverless. Their is a great possibility of issues coming with driverless cars, some subtle, and some severe. Also, who would want a driverless car if you still had to driver it? That does defeat the purpose of the name of the car. ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 8). Being occupied while sitting there is imperative. People will become bored if they have to just sit in the seat all day long. Companies have to come of with entertainment systems, but an issue with that is losing attention. While being in the driver's seat of a driverless car, being attentive is imperative. There may be situations where the car cannot handle it, and it requires human skills. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 7). There is a double whammy right there. Companies have to balance out occupying the driver and keeping them attentive; but there is no way to be distracted and attentive at the same time.

The risks involved with driverless cars are way to high for the potential payoff. The technology that is being developed might have a future, but in the near future, there is no way it'll work. Right now, they aren't even driverless cars, the cars still require a driver. Surely there will be progress on that aspec of the cars. Just simple knowing how the cars work is the first obsticle. Also, being able to figure out who is liable for damages between the manufacturer, or the driver of the car is a huge issue that comes with this. Lastly, how it will effect future driver's skills, and attentiveness while driving. Will there be a future in this industry, or not? Only time will tell.          ",5,3.0,,":**

32d6a9c,"If car usage is limited like it is in Vauban we would have malls on a walk away off a main street and not by distant highways. New communities that are less dependent on cars are being developed. The EPA in the US is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and legislators are starting to act cautiously.

In Paris they have such a high population which is near record they enforced a partial driving ban to let the air clear up.

On Monday people with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their car at home or suffer a 22 euro fine in American currency $31 and the next it applied for the odd numbered license plates. 4,000 drivers suffered the fine and 27 had their vehicals impounded for the way they reacted to getting the fine. Because so many people live in Beijing China and use vehicals it became known as one of the worlds most polluted cities would you want that happening to your city. Due to the warm days and cold nights the car emmisions were trapped in the air. Diesel fuel was blamed for the pollution.

In Colombia a program was set that one day was to be car free and they would use other modes of transportation such as buses, bikes, etc... it was the 3rd straight year in a row they did it and people who refused faced $25 fines. A businessman named Carlos Arturo Plazza states that ""it`s a good opportunity to take stress away and lower air pillution."" and for the first time  ever 2 more citties in Colombia joined the event. Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota and were enthusiastic to see the event. This campign began in Bogota in the mid 1990s. Which has lead to the developement of 118 miles of bike paths in Bogota. Also parks and sports centers bloomed throughout the city and new upscale shopping districts as well.

Finally in the US president Obama had goals to curb the US` greenhouse gas emissions were unveild. Recent studies in America show that fewer Americans are buying cars and get fewer licenses as each year goes by. The US having broad expanses and suburban ideals had long been on of the world`s prime car cultures. It`s the birth place of the first ever model T in Detroit. The rate of car ownerships per household and per person slowly began to decrease withing 3 years. If the patteren persists and many beleve it will it will have benificial implications for the US` carbon emissions and the environment. transportation is the 2nd largest source behind power plants. It would have a negative implication for the car industry. ther has been a large drop in percentage of 16-39 years old getting their licenses.

These are some reasons why people should limit their car usage so we can keep the positive trend in the car for our enviroment and make breathing healthier to people and lower our pollution. So keep it up and our enviroment will start to recover from the years of pollution we have caused.

3333188,"Dear Senator Im writing you this letter to let you know that I argue with you of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus  two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight  races in the ""swing"" sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

33504eb,"In the article ""Driverless Care Are Coming"" the author presents to the reader a set of positive and negatibe aspects of driveless cars. The driveless cars are cars that do not need a huamn to drive/control the wheel while on the road. These cars are able to drive for you, and give you a better way of getting places safer and more effective. There are problems as well with the cars; shown in the paragrapghs below, you will see why driverless cars are not the future of cars.

""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" made many great points on why driverless cars are a good for the people in the world, but they also stated some very good points on why it would not be. For example, in the article it says the cars are very expensive due to the work that would have to be done to the roads and the cars themselves for them to work corectly. In paragraph four it states ""For starters, they needed a while lot of sensors."" meaning that the car itself would need more added to make sure it was effective which technically cost more money. Not only is money an issue but the fact that driverless cars will taking the skill of driving away from people. As you get older you start to learn how to drive and get to learn all of the rules of the road, but with a driverless car you will most likely not have to learn how to drive. Not knowing how to drive leads to not learning the rules of the road which will lead to more accidents and lawsuits.

Drivelss cars are the future of cars. Yes, maybe, but as said in the article they still have not found a fully effective driveless car the does not need the help of a human when it comes close to danger or something unfamiliar. As said in paragraph seven ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driveless."" this shows that even with more developed technology they still have not made a fully effective driverless car. The whole point of a driverless car is so the person behind the wheel techinically does not have to drive. Another example is that the drivers must stay alert whcih makes the car even less of a big deal because as said before, the car is not technically driverless. If they want these cars to be the future they need to develope a truly effective car, not just a semi-effecive car.

Another reason why the driverless car is not a car that should be made is because with a driverless car there is no one technically to blame for an acident because the car was not driven by anyone but itself. In paragraph nine the article says ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver of the manufacturer?"" this shows the car is only made to drive not to protect what is beyond. The manufacturer should be more invested on how to change the fact that it will not be one- hundred percent and change how safe the car actually is. An example that brought attention was in paragraph ten when the author of the article said ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percebt of the time"" still shows how the car is not truly a driverless car which means that the car name itself is false advertising. That wilol also lead to lawsuits becasue it is not what the consumer/buyer was looking for when they heard the name ""driverless car"".

The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" made many great points on why or why not a driverless car is a good car. Reading the article there were many points that stood out about why the car would not be a good car, than to why it would be a good car. To sum up the driverless car is a car that still is not always effective which can bring harm to the people inside of the car and the people beyond the car. Driverless cars are taking away the fact that as a person driving is a skill you must learn, not just get it handed to you because you have a ""driverless"" car. To conclude the driverless car is not a good car and more people should not support the idea.             ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of driverless cars, arguing that they are not the future of cars due to their high cost, potential for accidents, and lack of full effectiveness.

337506c,"Do you know what the challenge of Exploring Venus is? Well venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus distance but safe vantage point of Earth has very challenging place to examine more closely. They also often called Venus as the Earth's Twin. Let's see what The Challenge of Exploring Venus is all about.

First of all,

Earth, Venus , Mars are like neighbor that orbits the sun at different speeds. The differences in speed that we are closer to Mars than other times to Venus. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms. Humans has numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud -draped world. Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more tha a few hours.

Secondly, The thick atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide that blankets Venus. The more challenging are the clouds of highly sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The planet's temps are average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our own planet. The conditions on Earth are far more extreme than anything humans encounter.

Thirdly,

NASA has one particularly compelling ideas to send humans to study Venus. NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus allow scientist to float above the fray. Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Many researchers are working on innovations that allows our machines to last long enough to knowledge Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.

In a conclusion, Do you know what the challenge of Exploring Venus is? Well, Earth, Venus , Mars are like neighbor that orbits the sun at different speeds.

3380b17,"Is this something that kids in History class want to hear their teacher talk about? How Mona Lisa felt? I do not think so , but an art class might want to hear about it.

This should not be taught in a history class. This should be tought in an Art room setting. Like Painting class or Drawing class. The reason I say that is because painting and drawing are alike in some ways. In painting you use paint to ""draw"" your assignment. In drawing you use a pencil,sharpie,or a marker to draw your assignment.

If this was a requirement in History class,this subject would be very boaring and irrelevent in so many ways. But in Art since Leonardo da Vinci painted this there could be an entire lesson on it. Then the teacher could have the students draw/paint Mona Lisa

So I think it should not be tought in any other class than Art. The reason I say that is a lot of kids have at least seen this painting one time in their life. And if they take Art they will learn about it. So there is no sense in wasting time in other classes when they will just learn about it in Art class. I do not think some kids would like to have their emotions read on some type of computar software.

3393759,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents to humans that even get near the planet. Even with the dangers that are poised against those who would go near Venus, there is still intrigue in the planet from our simple human nature, the opporatunity of studing an Earth like planet besides our own, and the fact that Venus is so close to Earth.

The main reason of studying the planet Venus is capitalized by the article and the author in this quote ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" The Author also simply puts in the article that humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus all unmanned.

Another reason for the intrigue in studing Venus is our simple human nature. In another quote by the author and in the article ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus beceause it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" the author gives us a reason and it's a reason that makes logical sense. The landscape of Venus is also described in the article as Earth like.

33dcf9a,"If I was trying to tell someone why I think that the landform on Mars was created naturally I would start by saying this:

First you must bring into consideration that to have a logical reason to think that aliens created the face on Mars you would have to have reliable evidence that there is life on Mars. Without the evidence of life on Mars, there would be nothing to base this belief off of, other than hope. Also, there are landforms on Earth that were created naturally that resemble this lanform.

The way the ""face"" looks in the pictures can also be caused by lighting and the way the picture was taken. If pictures were taken today, it could have better resolution and it might not even look like a face.

Scientists have found flowing water on Mars, so the ""face"" could have been created by weathering and erosion and just happened to look like a face. It may have also been created by storms with weathering and eroding.

Garvin mentions that,"" If there were homes in the most recent picture, you would have been able to see them because the quality of the picture has increased to the point where it is almost as clear as you could get.

33e6120,"Being bored in the middle of class really sucks. You sit there staring at your computer screen longing for the time to go by faster. Well with the new Facial Action Coding System it can read your emotions from your face and change things up a bit. These are very good for classrooms to keep kids from getting bored and going off track.

When I'm sitting in class I don't like to be bored the whole time. I want to learn and pass, but I can't do that if I keep spacing out or falling asleep while doing my work.

I want to be entertained and interested in what I'm supposed to be learning. If my computer had the Facial Action Coding System installed in it then when I began to get bored it would notice and would change the lesson or how it was teaching me.

In conclusion, I believe that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for classrooms to have to keep students from getting bored and not doing their work. It would help them learn and keep them interested in the lesson. This would help students pass and keep them going for a better chance for a good career with a better education using this system.

341c5e2,"Limiting care usage is an advantage because some people were always tense when they had a car and now they're saying they're much happier without it. Vauban is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"". Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipes.. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

In the United States, the Envirornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and legislatores are starting to act, if cautiously. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog... Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67% of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel engines in the rest of Westen Europe. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer licenses as each year goes by. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the envirornment, since transportation is the second largest souce of America's emissions, just behind power plants. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond product range beyond the personal vehicle. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit..

New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-to 39 year olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009... Bill Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestiran, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportaion traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.

So in the end with all this information i think that limiting car usage is an advantage. It makes you explore more, get your excercise, try new things instead of always relying on a vehicle to take you somewhere. This information persuaded me and it made me realize what the gas from the car does to the Earth. this is the reason why the Earth and the air we breathe is so polluted because of whats in our cars and we dont even realize it. im definitely going to use it to my advantage i dont know about you....            ",1,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that limiting car usage is an advantage.

3494df9,"In the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author supports this idea because in paragraph 4 he says ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and it includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive"".

He also says that ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endevours.

3496a0a,"False Face on Mars

For some decades people have been spark with the idea of an acient civilization/aliens on Mars for a while due to Viking 1 capturing a picture of what seem to be a face on Mars. Hollywood movies, commercial, comics, and etc commercial things have fill the minds of many people with flase accusation. The saying of don't always beleive what you see or hear is true in this situation. There are many reason why this information is false. And I as a scientist at NASA will give you reason and facts on why it is flase.

The truth is there is no face on Mars. If there were face on Mars there would be many more sign of life and ancient artifact or buildings from ages ago. Just like in Earth there were many sign leading to ancient civilization such as the Inca, Maya, Aztec, and Egytian. This civilization had proof such as ruins, artifact, and fossil leading to it, but there weren't any sign of any of those in Mars instead there was just an asume face . As one can see here with just an asume face on Mars so it was unlikely that an aliens/other being did it.

A person might claim that scientists could be hiding fact from people so they don't find out the truth about the face like an alien actually making the face. I as a scientist would have already known report or leaked if some scientist were hiding something. Scientist love to share facts or truth, it is their second nature. And it is our responsibility to tell you guys about new fascinating discover we made not hide it. And this proof that is it would be pointless for scientist to hide the truths from people.

One of the most vauble reason is that the picture was taken in the 1900s. At the time the camera qualities and technowlogy weren't as advance as nowdays. The article state that there were three perfect shot of the picture taken one from 1976, 1998, and 2001. there is abig difference in each of these shot. In the 1976 picture it show a picture of what seem to be a face but later on in the 1998 picture it show a disoriented face or landform. Then in the last picture in 2001 it show a martian or a natural landform such as one that is in Earth. The qualities in these has much difference as the 2001 one being the most advance. The face also was effect by shadow from Mars, as state in the article that the dark color for the eys and nose plus mouth of the face image was cause by shadow from an angle in Mars due to the camera not being able to take a perfect angle of the martian. And all these fact are poiting out that the face on Mars is a false information.

With information scientist have been gathering and finding an alien being or an acient civilization on Mars is a dead end. The media is have a great effect on the people minds leading them to not see the truth that the face on Mars is a very false idea coming from the people minds, Now that the facts has been out to public people are agreeing with the scientist more and more. Thus all these facts and research from scientists leading to that the Face on Mars is FALSE but just a martian landform.

34ad8eb,"Ah, the electoral college. Don't you just

LOVE

how irrelevent, unfair, and confusing it is? In fact, it is so without flaw, that in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but he lost the presidency (Source 2). Some people say that the electoral college is an anachronism, but some people disagree. Those people are wrong. The electoral college was irritating in the 1960's, and it's irritating now. You should side with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce (Source 2), and abolish the electoral college.

First, and most importantly, the electoral college is unfair to voters . Most states in the electoral college is based on a ""winner take all"" system; if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors (Source 1). This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after ""swing states"" (Source 2).  If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win (Sources 1 and 3). Voters for the electoral college say that people in the swing states are going to pay closer attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters (Source 3),  but should 10% of the nation decide who runs your country?!

The second virus causing the electoral college to convulse and bite its tongue in half is what happens in the event of a tie. If this is to occurr, then state delegates in the House of Represenatatives decide the President (Source 2). Each state only casts one vote, so the representative from Rhode Island would have just as much to say as the 55 representatives from the state of California (Source 1 and 2). Not only that, but a majority of people vote one party for president and another for Congress (Source 3). There are 538 possible votes in the electoral college (Source 1), so it isn't impossible for a tie to happen. In 1976, if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had switched candidates, there would have been a tie (Source 2).

And finally, the last thing that makes the electoral college as relevant as a new wheel for your horse and buggy is that, it's mind-bogglingly confusing. The electoral college is run by humans, so we must account for human error. The electors are just people chosen by the candidate who don't hold a seat in government (Sources 1 and 2). In 1960, a group of racists in Louisiana almost replaced Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, and he would have lost the election (Source 2). In Hawaii, also in 1960, two slates of electors were sent (Source 3). Faithless electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for anyone else (Source 2).

In conclusion, the electoral college is literally pointless. It's unfair and confusing. If America had decided on a majority rules electoral system, and not this pile of trash, we would still have all the same presidents we did before. Well, except Al Gore.

34e37d0,"In my opinion, I'm against driveless car and I believe that it is not safe for us. Driverless car still have a long way to go; none of the driveless car that are invented today are ready to be tested in the real world. We have car that we used in today world and theres no problem with it. There are no reason why we need Driveless car.

First, how can we trust driveless car or the company creating these car? They are so useless and we dont need it. I know it sound cool ""self driving car"" but, how can we trust these companies makeing these car. Most of the comany that sell car are money maker. According to the ""Drivelss Cars are Comming"" in paragraph nine the author stated ""If the techonology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" What if you are invloved in accident and none of it was your fault, and they chager you for it.

Futhermore, We should all be concered about this, and my big concered is how much these Driveless car cost? What if it cost like million of dollar to own these car. Then it would be useless and a wastefull of money. In the text it also stated that the car can only handle 25 mph, and the human have to keep hold of the wheel. What the point of riding the driveless car, if you have to keep hold of the wheel. In the rest of paragraph 7 it talks about the human must stay alert and be ready to over take any danger situation. Coumpter car are not really safe there could be a smart hacker and takes contorol of your car. How will we react to a hacker and who would be responblie for it if we got invovel in a carsh?

On the other hand, Most of the company like Mercedes-Benz, audi, and Nissan plan to have car that can drive by themselves by 2020. As times goes on coumpter will drive our own car and ruled over us. We have to be aweard of what is happening. Most of us are not even sure what self driving car exactly is and never been on self drving car before. For me, I think I dont need self driving car I got my own hand and I can drive my self as safe as I wanted to be.

In conclusion, I hope in the near future there will be no consequencey with self driving car. Years 2020, is not a long way before you know it everyone could ride selfdriving car. Coumpter will contorol the car and we put our saftey in their hand. We will have to turst the coumpter that it is safe to ride the self driving coumpter car.

34ee1a0,"Dear, senator

As a student learning more and more about the world we live in I understand that there has been problems deciding weather or not congress should continue to use the electoral college the elect our nationals new or future presidents. I believe that the race for presidency in just a huge game and the electoral college is just a great tool that is used in this game to find a faster way to win. But some people probably don't even know how to use it which is why the problem was arroused.

Taking aways the electoral college is like playing a game that have no obsticles nor opponents to challege you. Nothing in life is fare or cheep and by only using popular votes is to cheat the candidates of the true experience of running for what they want. If you or me were to run for president I'm sure we would want to have the oppertunity to use the electoral college to our advantage.

I believe the electoral chollege should continue to be used and nothing hsould change about how our stong nation selects our leaders because with change comes new obsticals and with those leeps and jumps comes errors. To change the way something has been done for such a long time would be like asking to distroy something and rebiuld it all the way back from the begining. I think that as a nation these problems are nothing to us, Why creat a big problem out of a simpler problem when we can just let it be and work our way arround the problems we face together.

34f1c56,"The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is higly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people allign themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush. The Electoral College should be kept in use because it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote.

To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" ""This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election, but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions.

In addition, the Electoral College eliminates the unfair advangate of having a bigger state, allowing smaller states to have a significance in the election."" The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them. People might claim that large states deserve more representation because more people live in them, but this doesn't preserve the equality for other smaller states's citizens that the United States stands for. This makes it apparent that without the Electoral College only the ""big states"" would matter and the candidates wouldn't have to worry about the small states.

Finally, the Electoral College does its best to eliminate the issue of not being able to determine the winner when the majority vote does not differ. "" Most states have a winner-take-all system that  awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This stops the problem that occured in 1968 with Nixon and 1992 with Clinton, and provides a clear definite way to choose the winner. If the Electoral College wasn't in use, lengthy recounts and much controversy would follow elections to try to determine if the votes were fair; this would cause too much strife and unrest within the country. It can be argued that even with the conflict it provides the people a chance to make their votes count, but it does more harm than good and it doesn't truly change anything. As a result, the Electoral College solves the issue of uncertainty and significance of vote.

In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.

3515161,"Fellow citzens i am here to inform about the advantages of limiting car usage. limiting car usage has made people feel safer walking and planners are noe taking the concept to the suburbs. expert says its a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gases.

In this new approach to limit car usuage stores are placed a walk away on a main street,rather than in malls along some distant highway. even in the united states the enviromental protection agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.

for example congestion went down in france after five days not being to drive and of intensifiying smog.70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars,and 57 percent  sold a car to move here. most people are happier with the the car usage limit due to that fact that they have too be tense anymore. and the wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

Vauban,home to 5,500 people wihtin a rectangular square mile , is the most advanced experiment in low-car sudan surburban. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year.

New suburbs may look more vauban-like,not only in developed countries but also in developing world,vauban,germany residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers,going where few soccer moms or commuting excutives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars .

Vauban,completed in 2006,is anexample of a growing trend in europe,the united states and else where to seperate surburban life from auto use,as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"".                             ",1,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the advantages of limiting car usage, but it does so inconsistently.

357c8cc,"I disagree with with having driverless cars because of possible technology issues, anxiety, and who would be held accountable if the car crashes. There are way too many questions that cannot be answered when it comes to these cars. Also i honestly think risk of death while in one of these cars is a lot higher than an actual human driver.

If driverless cars actually came to be then that would mean they would have to implant several radars and motion systems in each and every car they create, accroding to paragragh four. Also in paragraph four it says all of these systems are necessary to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. If they have to install of these system just to mimic a human's skill, then how much more technonlogy do you think they are going to need to actually avoid as many wrecks as humans. The creation of the driverless car is to lower the rate of car crashes. If they are using all of this technology just to mimic a human behind the wheel, then all of the hard work would be pointless because the rate of car crashes is not going to change if the driverless car is just like human behind the wheel. Also even if they do create these cars and a small interference takes place, how many cars would it effect and who would the blame fall back on? The driver or the manufacturer.

In paragraph seven it states the will cars have special sensors to make the driver keeps a hold of the wheel. Also it states that the human driver inside of the vehicle would have to remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires them to. This would create anxiety for millions of drivers. The driver would have no clue when they would have to take full control of a moving vehicle and meanwhile other cars are driving on the same street too. I can think of several instances where this could cause easily create a wreck. For example what if the driver decieds to change the radio station it is their turn to take over and they slam on the brakes. The cars behind the driver might also end up wrecking trying to avoid the driver that wanted to go from 96.1 to 106.1 on the radio for a split second while the radars had full control of the car.

My last reason I do not agree with driverless cars is because who would the blame fall on if the cars crashed. How would outsiders know what caused the crash. If there is a crash where both of the drivers are knocked out, then who would be able to talk and remeber what system caused them to crash. In paragraph nine it says if the technology fails and someone gets hurt who is held accountable? This is a very good question that seems to be very hard to answer. Therefore, driverless cars are a bad idea.

In conclusion driverless cars are a very bad idea beacause of possible tech issuses, aniexty, and who would be liable if the car crashes.

3581478,"Cars have been a world wide trend for years, but is that trend coming to an end? A new one is coming into play, and it is the car-less suburb and city. The emissions from cars are putting a strain on the health of city air and officials around the world are setting forth the car-less street.

In Germany there is a little suburb called Vauban, which is almost completely car free. While ownership of a vehicle is allowed, the only place someone could park it would be a large garage at the edge of the community, which a space costs around $40,000 to buy. As a result 70 percent of the families ther don't own cars. This new trend is predicted to cut down greenhouse gasses in suburbs and cities, for which cars are resposible. ""Automobiles are the linchpin of of suburbs.... And that, experts say, is a huge impedement to current efforts to drastically reduce gas emissions form tailpipes.... Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of... gas emissions in Europe... and some 50 percent in... the United States.""(In German Suburbs Life Goes on Without Cars by Elizabeth Rosenthal p. 5)

In the Colombian city of Bogota millions of city dwellers hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on a special day called The Day Without Cars. The citizens agree it is a fruitful endeavor, that lowers pollution, releives stress, and provides a great opportunity to excersize. It even set a trend for two other cities who, for the first time since the event started three years ago, joined in the special day. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay. (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky p.26)

While cars still have their uses, it seems like they are slowly becoming a fading fad. People around the world are embracing a life without cars, and trying to put a dent in the world's pollution. Who knows, if Americans embrace it, there might be an end to the obesity epidemic.

35ba672,"We humans have made some fantastic things over the years, but driver less cars was a bad idea because things maulfunction, there's no one to blame in case of accedent, and we will become dependent on them.

To begin with, our technoligy has malfuntioned a few or more times, so how can we be so sure that driverless cars are a good idea?

The main question is what will we do then?

We should just stick with the old fashion way hands and wheels. Machienery can be risky at times because there so unpredictable they can be working just fine then all the suden BOOM car crash, and some people can't afford insurance. How will the company pay for all the car crashes, they wont.

Another reason we should not put these death machiens on the market is because who are we going to blame for all the accedents and car crashes that are going to happen? So many problems are going to be faced when some one is trying to get money from a crash or some one is injerd. How will this be ruled out and can we trust our selfes and the next generation with this vehicle? Agien these vehicles should not hit the market because they will hit people.

In the article it states that ""the car is in autopilot 90% of the time"" what about the other ten percent of the time.

Although there are many things bad about this car there have been SOME good things about it the article states ""the car seat shakes when the passenger is in danger"" so thats good. Some people think that the car is a gift from god and from really any stand point this car will change the world (or the U.S.).

Last but not least, we should not have these cars because we will be dependent on them. These cars are going to be like phones first unreliable then they get better then they take over the world. A bunch of people will have their seats all the way back lounging not even caring at all.

As we can see these will become a problem for the next generation mabey the car reck rate will go up maby it wont. People wont even have to see where there going just put directions in the gps and sleep.

These machines should not be trusted. People who are making these STOP!

35fd114,"The new techonology tht is called Facial Action Coding System is beinng use to identify human emotions. If this were to be used in a classroom some kids might not want to be scanned and have there emotions known. So I honestly think that this machine or new piece of techonology should not be used in classrooms and heres why.

To start it off I can already tell that some kids will not want there emotions to be known. That's something that the kid is able to keep a secret. If the kids doesn't want there emotions to be known then he or she has the right to not let them be known. Now in paragraph 6 a quote from Dr. Huang ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Now although it is true that some kids may need help for the work that there doing. They may not understand it and that's where the computer comes in. But the teacher can't just scan the kids face and have the computer do all the work. The teacher has to also know when a kid is having troube with the material. Obviously it's almost impossible to know how every student is doing but if you see a kid getting bad grades on the material then the teacher should help the student out. That goes back to if the student actually wants to be scanned to identify his or her emotions.

A quote from Dr. Huang "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression."" That's is also another thing that I want to talk about. The teacher really has to care for his or her students. It's the teachers job to make sure that a kid is doing good in school. I do understand that there are some kids that just don't even try. Those kids are difficult to make them succeed. But for the other students the teacher has to know if he or she is having a bad day. You could ask whats wrong and if the student doesn't want to tell you then they don't have to. But the teachers have to make sure that the student knows that the teacher is there to help. Now although some kids hide there expressions really well I guess that's

when you would want the maching to scan there face. But as I keep saying only if they want to. The teacher might have a problem on knowing how a kid feels and knowing there emotion. But if the student doesn't want there emotion to be known thats what the kid wants. In many ways we don't need a maching to help with human proteries. Thats why humans talk to humans anout there emotions not humans talk to machines.

I hope that this new techonology is going towards high schools. In this day and age so many high schcoolers are going through alot. It doen't take a rocket scientist to know how a student feels when it's finals week. There are situations where the teacher doesn't need to know how a student is feeling. The only time where a student needs to be scanned is when that student is having trouble on a material and if the student actually wants to be scanned by the Facial Acton Coding System. I want to talk about this quote from paragraph 6 from Dr. Huang ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The fact that a computer needs to explain the work to a student is just wrong and dumb. That is why a teacher is in the classroom. That's why the teacher went to college to get her degree and work with students. We all know that there are bad teachers in this world. The teachers where all they do is give you a packet and ask for it finished tomorrow. The teachers where they do a horible job at explaining the material. Then and only then will I be good with having the Facial Action Coding System scan the kids faces. Thats is when the computer will help out the students and teach them the material that the teacher can't do. That is the only time I think that is okay to use.

So there are

my thoughts on why this should not be able to scan the kids faces when in a classroom. I honestly feel that the kid has the right if they want to be scanned even if the kid is having trouble in the class and if the kids emotions are easy to be seen that's is when a teacher comes and helps.So no this should not be in classrooms. But I do think that it could be used in other better ways. Like in a police forece where they scan the person who did the crime to get information. But not in a classroom.

36050fb,"Driveless cars should'nt be allowed to be on the road. I dont think it's a good idea because drivers will not remain fully focused on the road, drivers will get bored waiting for their turns to drive, and if these cars were to create an accident it would be a ""who to blame"" case.

Starting off by sayin drvers will not remain fully focused on the road should be enough of a red flag to make it a no. In paragraph 7, it may state "" The human driver must remain alret and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" but, if a car is doing all the driving, it's giving the driver time to get distracted. They are now given easier access to text and drive, make phone calls, and attempt other tasks they have no business doing while driving. Making being on the road a dangerous place.

Secondly, like the question asked in paragraph 8, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" Boredom to me leads to messing with other objects around me and losing focus. That's what will happen. Later to say, ""We have to interpret the driving in a fun way."" Driving is not supposed to be fun. You're supposed to get in and take yourself from point a to point b. The passage also talks a sort of bringing in an ""in-car entertainment system"". Just another distraction in my opinion, once again, making the road a dangerous place!

Lastly, and most importantly, if an accident would to come of these cars driving the road, who would be the one to blame? The question is aslo found in paragraph 9. The drivers would become so dependent of the car and trust it not to get them into an accident. While the manufactures are dependent on the law to pass a law so they don't get taken down with the lawsuit of an accident their cars are responsible for. They do not want to help you, they want your money.

Closing this with a stong statement: you cannot expect a driver to have such this nice of a creation in their possession and not fully confide in it. They're going to get distracted because they're allowed to now that something else is doing the driving. They're going to get bored, because now, they are hardly needed. These drivers would expect the manufacturers to take care of any problem created with the car, because of the fact that the car was the one doing the driving.",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument against allowing driverless cars on the road.

366ba9d,"I think that emotion calculating technology in a classroom could be very valuable. This technology could help teachers to keep students interested. This could also help to teach students in a way that they enjoy and understand. An advanced technology like this could also help teachers and counselors to know when a student is feeling sad or depressed so that they can possibly help the student. This technology would be very valuable in any classroom, it could be the innovation that every classroom needs.

The FACS (Facial Acting Coding System) works by looking at the 44 major facial muscles. Every different facial muscle movement means something different, and this is what the FACS looks at to give a reading of the different emotions that the person is feeling. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. The FACS machine was invented by Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science. Dr. Huang relies on human psychologists like Dr. Paul Eckman to help decifer the expressions that facial muscles give. Dr. Huang used this technology on Mona Lisa. The readings said that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Using this technology on Mona Lisa is a prime example of how this technology can accurately measure a persons emotions.

This technology could be useful in a classroom in many ways. One way it would be useful, it could measure a students emotions to find out when a student is bored of a subject. This would be useful because if teachers know when a student is bored they could help to make the subject more interesting. Making subjects more interesting in return would raise students grades and happiness in school. This technology could also help counselors. This technology could help counselors by showing themwhen a student is sad or depressed so that they can help the student and also try to fix the problem causing those emotions.

Facial expression reading technology would help classrooms in many ways. This technology could potentially raise student's grades and even help to make students happier. This technology could also make students happier and help then to stay interested and having fun while learning. This advanced technology would be very beneficial to a classroom, it could even change the world of education all together.

3739677,"The topic of driveless cars is very controversial. Some people say that driveless cars will be hazard to society, and will only endanger more people all over the world so they should not be manufactured. Conversly, others believe they are a necessity and will be a great advance in technology for the future. I gravitate towards the former opnion of driveless cars becoming chaotic and troublesome, and they should not be developed. Driveless cars should not be invented because humans will be too distracted to handle them, the health and safety of pedestrians would be threatened, and the cars are not completely driveless.

In today's current society, people are engrossed in social media and digital communication. We are addicted to looking at Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and texting our friends and family that it has infected our daily lives. It has even contiminated our driving. People find their phones irresitable, and they can not even manage to restrain themselves from swiping up their phones to look at the newest message while driving. This leads to casaulties and injuries that are the result of the driver not having the ability to stay focused. If driveless cars are developed, people will have less of a reason to pay attention to the road. Once the car actually needs human help, the driver will be too invested in their phones that they won't respond, possibly leaving themselves or others brutally maimed or killed. My opponents say that the flashing lights that will be installed in these vehicles will be enough to keep drivers monitoring the road. However, I feel that this attempt of a precautionary measures will not be enough. With the drivers eyes fixated on the fluorescent screen and their bodies immobilized as they are fully immeresed into their phones, they will be blind to the flashing lights. Due to our cellular distractions, we will be unable to put our full attention into watching the road, and proving driveless cars should not be invented.

Everyday you hear about a car accident. Someone was looking at their phone, they ran a stoplight, or whatever the case may be. Now imagine driveless cars. the rate of car accidents will not be reduced but will actually increase because of these new vehicles. The driver may not pay attention, and when the car needs the human to take control, they won't react in time and will collide with another vehcile. There could also be technical difficulties with the car where it doesn't alert the driver when it needs to causing another incident of vehicular chaos. The article even states that they are laws banning the mere testing of computer-driven cars. There are endless possibilites as to what could happen, but this is enough to show that driveless cars will only threaten the lives of pedestrians even more than current cars.

The main interest in driveless cars is that they are supposed to be driveless. However this is false. The car still needs a human to pay attention to the road when the car needs assistance. The name is a fallacy and the current details about it prove it is useless. Why replace our current cars that work just fine with computerized cars that could have all kinds of issues. They are just a dangerous and expensive waste.

Driveless cars are a very interesting topic. However the shouldn't be made because humans will be too distracted to handle them, the health and safety of pedestrians would be threatened, and the cars are not completely driveless. Eventually they could be made when people are more responsible, and the technology is more reliable and safe, but as of now they should stay off the roads and in our imaginations.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that driveless cars should not be invented.

37404a5,"Emotions are something that every person in the world feels everyday. Except some people here and there who actually are incapable of feeling emotions! A person can feel many emotions at once or just one very specific emotion because humans are emotional people, especially students. School can be stressful to many people and that's okay, but certain technology may not solve that problem. The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom is not valuable because, students can become distracted, the technology may scan the wrong emotions, and it is an invasion of privacy.

Student can become distracted in the classrooom by the Facial Action Coding System. Students can begin to make silly faces in the camera or try to display different emotions to see what happens to the lesson they are doing. The article states that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The student may take advantage of the software to get a modified lesson that may be easier than what they are capable of. While there are student that would not take advantage of the opportunity to have such technology in the classrom, there are always the rebel students that will take advantage. If a student is not getting the work that they are capable of doing their learning will come to a hault and they will not get the benifits they should, compared to a human intructor. Human instructors can possibly be a better tool to use rather than the FACS.

The Facial Action Coding System may pick up the wrong emotions generating a more simple lesson. Like previosly stated, people can feel many emotions at once for many different reasons. The article states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions—happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness—and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The system may pick up emotions, but it was never said that it will be able to tell why you are feeling these emotions. A student maybe have other things running through their mind that may not have anything to do with the work they are completing. The system can pick up an emotion and modify the lesson. It would be a mere mistake but the mistake will obstruct the learning capabilities of the student.

The FACS may be an invasion of privacy to some people. The system would be constaly reading your facial expression, which students may be uncomforable with. There are many shy and quiet people because not everybody is very social and likes to be on camera. The article states, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""

A system that always watching you? The Facial Action Coding System sounds like something students can be uncomfortable with, considering that people tend to more private. Not every astudent will be so excited to hop right on the FACS train because they may see having a computer watching you as an invasion of their personal life.

The Facial Action Coding System may be helpful elsewhere, but it may not be something wonderful to have in the classroom. Technology seems to be flourishing throughout the years. The FACS doesn't seem valuable to have in the classroom. Students can be distracted, the system may not fuction properly, and it is an invasion of privacy. Yes, technology may be great and all, but some things are better off held in the hands of humans.    ",5,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue, arguing that the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is not valuable in the classroom due to potential distractions, incorrect emotion scanning, and privacy concerns.

377cdc4,"Did you know that mars was created naturaly as a natural landform? Does Mars have a simular landform as Earth? If aliens has created Mars, where are they now? The passage Unmasking the face on Mars has the answers to all of those.

I believe that Mars was created as natural landform just like Earth. It has simular landforms as Earth. Mars has a dry sandy desert like climate simular to Earth. Except Earth has alot of different types of climates. If Aliens has made Mars why did they make it simular to Earth's desert climate? If aliens did make the climate for Mars it propbably would have been way different than a desert climate. Earth was made naturally and has naturally made several climates. The desert climate is one. Aliens could not have possibly made Mars because if they did where did they go? Why did they leave? They probably would have stayed and lived on Mars if they had created it.

Mar's desert climate has very simular landforms as Earth's desert climate. Garvin from the passage Unmasking the face on Mars has said ''It reminds me most of middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho''. That was from the 12th paragraph. Garvin has said this while he was looking at the pictures of the landforms. In paragraph 12 of the passage Unmasking the Face on Mars says '' What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---- landforms common around the American West''. That's another example the Mar's climate has simular landforms as Earth's desert climate. Scientist have said that Earth was like venus at first and then came together and formed on what it is like now naturally.

Aliens could have not possibly built Mars. Mars was probably created simular to how Earth was created. Scientists have even said that along time ago on Mars there use to be water there because they have found spots on mars simular to Earth that rivers run are running on. Now it looks dried up and something has happen to Mars to where it turned Dry and desert like. Earth was the same way along time ago before humans existed. It was a hot fire lava vocanic type of climate until Earth has changed and made several climates and water.

Earth was made naturally and by comparing how Earth was made and the simular features it has that Mars has I believe that Mars was created naturally like Earth. If aliens did create Mars for the simular features that Earth has why did they choose that climate?",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent thesis statement.

4bda0ce,"According to the articles,

'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'

,

'Paris bans driving dye to smog'

, and

'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota'

, there are many advantages that can come with the limiting of car usage.

Elisabeth Rosenthal mentions many of these in her article about Vauban, Germany. One woman she quoted in the third paragraph, Heidrun Walter, says ""

When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.

"" Not everyone may feel less tense after getting rid of their car, but it would definitely be a great thing. Another advatage that came with less car usage in Vauban that Rosenthal mentions in her article, is that stores started getting built about a walk away instead of in malls miles away. This is obviously an amazing point because everyone still has needs they must buy or tend to and it's much better if the places they buy the things they need are in walking distance because no one would need to use distance as an excuse to use their car.

In the fifth paragraph of Duffer's article, he makes sure to mention that car traffic was down 60% in Paris after they decided to enforce a partial ban on driving to also clear the air. If we limit car usage, their would be way less traffic, which means less time sitting in our cars aggravated about the fact that we're stuck and need to get to school or work soon or else we'll be late.

In the third article, which is written by Andrew Selsky he reports that in Bogota on their ""

car-free day

"" there was little to no traffic, and the annual event has reduced smog. In the fifth paragraph, he quoted a businessman named Carlos Arturo Plaza. Carlos says that the event is ""

a good oppurtinity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

"" The day without cars inspires you to find alternative transportation methods, which can be as simple as walking or even riding a bike which are both really healthy and great ways to get your excersise in! Selsky also notes that the day without cars has sparked the construction of more bicycle paths, bigger, nicer sidewalks and more parks and sports centers have popped up around the city. Clearly in Bogota they are taking advantage of keeping their air healthy by trying to inspire their residents to be and stay healthy as well.

Limiting car usage is not just a great way to reduce pollution and keep the planet we call home healthy, but a great way to keep us healthy, both physically and emotionally. Those are just about the best advantages that can come with anything.

4c28b83,"Every day people wake up, get ready, and go to work or school. The way they get there can vary but for the most part, people drive cars. That's about to change. Helping the enviroment and becoming more relaxed are advanatages for limiting car usage.

By reducing car usage, emmitions produced from automobiles can be reduced and help the enviroment. When cars reslease gas into the air, it causes smog which traps the gases and inhibits them from being able to escape the atomosphere. In largely congested cities smog can be as harmful as 147 micrograms of particulate matter as seen in Paris, France (paragraph 17). Paris enfored a partial driving ban due the amount of smog and just after one day of reduced driving, the smog clears enough so they didn't have to enforce the ban another day (paragraph 19). Passenger cars are resonsible for 12 percent of greeenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United States. (paragraph 5). This staggering statistic can open your eyes to how much cars really effect the envrioment. If just once a week you didn't use your car, you could reduce greenhouse gases drastically. In the United States today, recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, and are driving less. (paragraph 29). Since 1995, the number of miles driven per person dropped almost 9 percent (paragraph 32). With lesser people buying and driving new cars, gas emissions could change drastically within a few years and could help our evrioment exonentialy.

When you do not drive a car to from places every day, you become a more relaxed person. In Vauban, Germany- residents have given up cars almost all together, only 30 percent of residents owning cars. In this Suburban town, it seems comman for mothers to own a minivan to ship children back and forth all throughout town; Heidrun Walter feels other wise. She has given up her automobile to get around town and ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter states. (paragraph 3). For the past three years in Bogota, Colombia they take a day out of the year where only taxis and buses are permitted, the Day Without Cars. Even when dark clouds circled around the city and rain splattered down onto the heads of people, they didn't revert back to their cars. A businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (paragraph 24). This day has become so popular, two other cities in Columbia joined in as well the celebrate the day where people do not use their cars. People do not need to meet with other people in order to go to work or hangout with friends anymore; they can be in their own homes using the technology they access see their friends and continue to do their work.(paragraph 35). Without having to commute to an office, people feel less stressed and more relaxed being able to do their work in the comfort of their own home.

People used to accossicate cars as the best way to get from place A to B without thinking about the consequences it can have on the planet or on yourself. You have to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. What can you do to help change the world?

The thought of this idea just sounds dangerous. Driverless cars shouldn't be develeoped for many reasons such as; saftyness, expenses, and lazyness.

Safetyness is a big issue when it comes to cars. Just think about all of the rules that we have today reguarding safety with cars. Driverless Cars could cause accidents and many new laws to be made just because of the safety issues. As stated in paragraph 7, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" By saying this, who knows if they ever will really have a completey Driverless Car. Without being completely driverless, something could go wrong at any time and that isn't a good or safe thing.

The expenses of cars today are outrageus, but think about the cost for a Driverless Car. The prices of a driverless car will cost the inventors and the buyers. The inventors have to pay billions of dollars to complete a car that functions all by itself, which is going to be very expensive. All of the parts and technology are already high in todays vehicles, so a Driverless Car is definitely going to be high in price. The money being put into Driverless Cars could be going into more important things.

Driverless Cars will cause a lot of lazyness in today's world. Many people already text and do other things while driving, so imagine what they would if they didn't have to drive at all. The population of texting in driving would increse. People would probably fall asleep while driving, which can result in car accidents. This invention also involves people being lazy because they wont even have to learn how to drive anymore. The less people don't know about driving the lazier they can be, because they won't have to do anything when it comes time to drive.

Driverless Cars shouldn't be made due to safetyness, expenses, and lazyness. The car could mess up and cause an accident at any time, which isn't safe. Expenses for the Driverless Car would be very pricey and a waste. Lazyness will increase, because people won't have to learn to drive.

4d00492,"Dear Senator,

Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winner-take-all"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.

Yours,

4d6ac79,"Dear Senator,

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The system has been around for milleniums from our founding fathers and the Constitution in the 1700s to present day America, it is critical that we update our system to a more realistic process where the citizens have more say in the leader we choose to lead us. I am in favor in abolishing the Electoral College becasue most of the power should be held in the hand of the citizens and the popular vote should have more regards than the vote in Congress. I am not in favor in keeping the Electoral College because under the college system, voters don't vote for the president but for a slate elector, who in turn ""elect the president"", the process is unfair to voters, and over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election rather than the kind we have now.

When people go out of thier way to vote, they vote because they want to have a say in their potentially future. They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction. They would like to think that one vote could make a difference in a election, but with the Electoral College voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than vote who they actulally want to be president. Under the Electoral College voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. In reality the people are not voting for the president they are putting their trust in somebody they vote to vote for the person they have choose to lead. Democrats in Texas for example knowing their vote will have no effect in the election they become less interested in the campaign than they would if the president was choosen diectly by popular votes and that is unfair to the people.

The process is unfair to the people because of the ""winner takes all"" system in each state the canidates dont take time in states in which they know have no chances of gaining them any power, they stay in states that are more benefically to them. The canidates mostly focus on the tight races ocuring in the ""swing states"" in 2000 many states didnt even get to see the candiates because they were ""little, irrlevent, and worthless"" states. I'm sure many people in those sates such as South Carolina and Rhode Island had a lot of input to add in the 2000 campagin but because they were little minority states they werent focused on as much as the other larger staes. This is very unfair and judgementally to these states because the Electoral College is based on involuntary effects, the inhabitants of North Caiolina or Rhode Island cannot control where they choose to live, they might have to live in the certain geograpic location because of finaces or religous persecution. They may want to have a say in the election but cant because of their living arrangements.

Many might contradict that the Electoral College is benefical because it has more of a certain outcome but with that certainty comes many votes and state votes that were disregarded. The Electoral College is unfair in many different aspects we need to update our system of election, becasue like everything else in the world has an expiration date. Their is an expiration date on almost all of our food and beverages, an expiration date on salvery, an expiration date on our life, and so now we need an expiration date on the Electoral College.

4d6bbea,"Teaching in a classroom setting is something that has been happening sucessfully for centuries now, dating way way back before technology was even being thought about. This goes to show technolgoy is not needed, but maybe sonetimes helpful. In a classroom setting peices of technology such has things like computers can be super helpful when doing things such as writing an essay, and acessing information online, however when taken too advancely it can become more of a joke, and a distraction to students. That's where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The Facial Action Coding System theoretically seems to be a good idea but in reality it's an expensive toy. There are many other proven effective ways to teach in a classroom, and somethings are boring to learn about but you still have to know them, so just sit still, relax, and learn.

The first thing you notice when walking into a classroom is usually the students who are choosing not to spend their time wisely rather than the students who are. This is because students who choose be off task are often distracted by technolgy and gaming which is a lot more noticable to the human eye. These students are taking advantage of technology provided and using it for bad. So why would we put the Facial Action Coding System in schools when it is expensive and would be used as a toy? That's right, we wouldnt. When used for other purposes we also risk crashing which is another thing that would take up more time rather than taking that time for the students to be taught.

Everybody learns in differnt ways for example take the idea of studying for a spelling test. Some kids learn by writing it down multiple times, some kids learn by hearing it being spelled, others learn best by repeating it. There are so many way for kids to learn so by adding the Facial Action Coding System into schools you're assessing kids on how much they enjoy what they are learning about, and not how much information they are actually gaining. Which bring me to my next point.

Not every kid is going to be excited about everything they learn. Yes, some books are boring, and who wants to learn about what cells are made of, and who cares who invented the lightbulb, but these are all things kids are going to learn anyways. Not everything is going to be fun. sometimes you just need the facts. Making kids excited about a topic all comes from the influences of other people being excited about a topic and feeling that positive energy around them. If a computer screen told you you were bored, it wouldn't make you less bored.

The Facial Action Coding System is not all bad. There are some good parts about it. In the pasage the author talks about how ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" To recognize when a student is confused is a powerful thing, because when more students are confused they don't always like to say it, however the Facial Action Coding System is an expesive way to tell if a student is confused. If a child is confused they should say something. This allows students to build up self-confidence. All in all the Facial Action Coding System has both pros and cons, however the cons over power the pros making this tool not valuable in a classroom setting. It is an expensive toy that should be used for other purposes. Not to say there is no good uses for the Facial Action Coding System, but it is just not valueable in a classroom setting.

4da0062,"Have you ever thought about a computer reading your emotions? me neither, that sounds pretty cool huh. Well today its possible for your emotions to be read by new technology called ""the Facial Action Coding System"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman, this allows computers to recognize human emotions. I believe that this new technology can change things and improve the relationship between computers and humans.

Now lets take it back to Leonardo da Vinci and his Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help him paint muscles on the face as precisely as possible to show specific emotions. This painting was the first to be tested on this new software, yes a painting not real physical human face. The result showed hat Mona Lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. The whole process of calculating emotions begins with a computer constructed 3-D model of the being identified, the 44 important muscles have to move like human muscles. the movement of one or muscles is called a ""action unit"".

Dr. Eckman has classified the six basic emotions which are; Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Dr. Haung says in this passage that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly)"". humans calculate emotions everyday, you can tell when your friend is mad, sad, tired just by looking at their face. but not everyone can some people have trouble reading facial expressions on people.

Think about a computer knowing your exact emotion. For example when your doing an assignment that requires you to do research and the computer can tell that your getting bored with the website that you found by indentifiying your emotions at the moment, it could give you other sites that might interest you.

4e9bf56,"The development of a new, self-driving car that functions efficiently is being tested by various different companies, like Google and General Motors, but what practical purpose would this development solve? Some argue that these smart cars would increase traffic efficiency and could facilitate a new age of safe motor vehicles. Others argue that we cannot place our trust regarding safety solely in a machine. The creation of driverless cars should not be further developed, despite potential increase in safety, due to the increased dependency on technology it would facilitate, as well as liability issues regarding crashes or other potential accidents, both of which could negatively impact other aspects of the future.

Despite the issues of liability and dependency on technology, the development of new cars could potentially reduce safety risks associated with full human control over vehicles. Because ""the information from the sensors [of the driverless cars] can cause the car to apply brakes... allow a far better response and control than a human could manage,"" driverless cars may reduce potential for crashes of other incidents. Advanced sensor technology is indeed an asset to this new development, however taking this concept while maintaining human control could prove to be more benenficial, due to the lack of issues such as liability and also keeping humans active and engaged. The problem is that most people would nate place full trust in technology, thus eliminating the purpose of a ""driverless car"" being completely driverless. Ultimately, this potential asset is far outweighed by the costs of producing driverless cars.

Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road. As of right now, ""...none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This means that someone must always be in the driver seat to ensure safety when the situation requires them to take over. This, however, contradicts the purpose of the ""driverless car."" In addition, because the point of these cars is to drive safely without human control, people could have this in mind while in a driverless car. As a result they may give little regard to the road, and rely on the car to keep them safe and get them to their destination. Then, if they are not prepared for an alert or a need for human assistance, because they expected the car to handle it, their dependency on the car put their safety at risk.

The liability issues if such an accident were to occur could be tremendous. If there was an accident, the question would arise, "" who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This could lead to court trials and lawsuits that would either harm the consumers in the auto industry, or the producers. Either way, the costs would have an increasingly negative impact on the economy. It would not be logical to assume that these cars would be one hundred percent safe, as there is alway room for error, and ""presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver..."" Because many people refuse to place full trust in technology that could have potential flaws, if an accident were to occur, the industry of self-driving cars would likely crash, as people would more and more see this technology as danger, and place the blame on the auto industry.

If further developments were to be made so that these cars truly don't need a driver, while it may reduce safety risks, ultimately the costs regarding user dependency and liability would outweigh benefits. Increased dependency could actually create more safetly problems, and liability issues could result is a crash of the auto industry's smart technology branch. If the concept of this Driverless car were changed to, rather than have no driver, help the driver, then the outcome may be more beneficial. If people still drove the car, but with helpful alerts, warnings, or displays, traffic safety would go up, and the liability and dependency issues would be lessened or dissolved altogether. A new age of technological innovation is here, and utilizing this idea in this moderate waycould pave the road to a brighter future.",6,4.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view and provides adequate examples and evidence to support its position.

4f6582d,"While NASA's greatest scientists were working hard in their Jet Propulsion Lab in 1976, an eerie picture appeared on their monitors, as the spacecraft they sent to Mars, the Viking 1, has taken a picture of what looks like an alien-built human face on Mars, though it was actually another basic landform on the red planet. The reason Viking I was taking pictures of Mars was to scope out possible landing sites for its sister ship, the Viking 2. The scientists did realize that this ""face"" was just another common Martian landform, so when they put the picture up, its caption stated that it was only a rock formation resembling a human head. In order to fully prove to everyone that the Face on Mars was just a landform, they even sent the MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, to retake pictures of the area presumed to be the face. They even sent it back for another round of retakes thanks to peoples' suspicions of cloudy weather blocking the view of the face! Thanks to many tests and retakes, scientists have proven that the Face on Mars is just another landform.

While Viking 1 was taking pictures on Mars to find a landing site for Viking 2, it snapped a picture of what appeared to be a gigantic face staring at them like a man staring at the stars with binoculars. Although scientists were very surprised when the face appeared on the monitors in their lab, their sensation lasted only a short time. They figured it was only another common Martian mesa with shadows that only resembled a human face. So that they could get enough hey-everyone-check-this-out popularity for the red planet, they made the image of the Face on Mars public, and the NASA scientists gave it the caption noting that it was ""a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Thanks to this new caption, public attention for Mars, but it ended up dominating people's view on Mars, making them create conspiracy theories rather than convince the truth that it was only another landform on Mars. Despite the people making the Face on Mars a well-known pop icon, it always was and always will be another Martian landform.

In order to prove to the people that the Face on Mars was an ordinary-as-white-paint landform, they sent a new probe, the Martian Global Surveyor, or MGS, to Mars in 1998 to try to retake pictures of the face. The MGS succeeded at its task, as it swayed public opinion away from the idea that the face had to do with alien life existing on Mars at that time. Thousands of looking-forward-to-this web explorers were waiting for the picture to become public, they were also disappointed by the fact that it was a natural landform rather than an exotic alien monument. However, not everyone was satisfied with these results, as they wanted more proof that the face was a face and not a landform thanks to cloudy weather. The MGS did succeed in proving that the Face on Mars was not a face, though more attempts were required to get the idea to everyone.

Not everyone was content with the results of the MGS expedition, wanting to believe that the cloudy weather at the time the picture was taken to be responsible for the lack of the face's visibility. Despite how NASA's chief scientist for their Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, stated that ""it's not easy to target Cydonia,"" the people wanted more retakes. NASA was able to get the MGS to get better shots of the face in April 2001, and they were able to capture a wonderful photo with the camera's maximum resolution, which dominated the Viking 1's resolution by being nearly thiry times better. Thanks to Garvin's reasoning and the high-as-the-sky resolution of the MSG's new pictures, they were able to prove that the face was only the equivalent of a butte or mesa, both of which were common landforms. Thanks to the MSG's multiple trips, they captured enough well-detalied pictures to prove the true identity of the Face of Mars.

The Face of Mars is only an ordinary landform, and it always will be just another ordinary landform. The scientists began with a caption to the original photo stating that it was a landform only resembling a face, then they sent the Mars Global Surveyor out to try to prove that the Face on Mars was a landform. They also later sent the MGS out again during not-cloudy-at-all weather to let everyone know for sure that the face was not a face. All of these efforts combined let people know how the Face on Mars was not a face but only a landform, but there are likely still people out there who belive that the Face on Mars is still some type of alien relic. Despite how popular the conspiracy theories about the Face of Mars being an alien monument, it was only a standard landform the whole time.",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

50d3e20,"Some people are better at hiding emotions than others, but with a recent innovation from Thomas Huang, a professer at the Bechman Institute for Advanced Science, hiding emotions may no longer be so easy. With the software that was recently created, computers can read emotions off of somebody's face. This information is discussed in Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" which talks about many of the aspects of what the Facial Action Coding System can do. Though there can be some cons with this software, they are out-weighed by all of the pros, especially ones found in classrooms. In classrooms if a computer can sense confusion, boredom, or even anger then a teacher can help the student with whatever barriers they are facing.

Classrooms contain various emotions, including anywhere from sadness to rage. According to D'Alto, ""...the software can even identify mixed emotions..."" That can be very valuable for classrooms so the software can read whether the student may be upset and confused, or bored and uninterested. Once the teacher gets ahold of that information then they will be able to help the student and tend to them by their needs. If a student is confused then the teacher will be more likely to be sympathetic and helpful, while if a student is bored then the teacher might give them more challenging work. Although some people may think that the Facial Action Coding System is a phony, it is proven to be otherwise. In fact, it is very well developed and the article states, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" Not only has this software been tested many times, it has been constructed so it can read facial muscles and destinguish the emotions well.

Along with the fact that the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers figure out how students are feeling about certain lessons, it also gives teachers more one on one time with students who need the help. D'Alto says that the software, ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" When the software does that, it can make a lesson harder for the people who need it or easier for others. Since the lesson can modify itself to the needs of students, that gives the teacher to go around and give help to those in need. Not only can a student get help from their computer, but they can get help from their teacher if needed to. That allows for a student to get two times the amount of help that they could get without the Facial Action Coding System. Some people may disagree with this and think that a computer does not have all of the resources that students need to understand a lesson. Though some people may think that face-to-face learning is more effective, it does not always work that way. In the article Dr. Huang says ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication... So computers needd to understand that, too."" Every student is different and learns differently. Many times communication is nonverbal and is just by facial expressions. If a computer can understand that as well a teacher does, there is no problem with computers helping out students.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System can help students is because if the students know others are confused as well, then they can help each other out. Dr. Huang says that, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" If students start to understand how others are feeling about certain concepts then they might not feel as alone. Some students tend to think that it is only them that do not understand a certain subject or unit, but if computers track and show that even though some people might not look worried and they are, students might feel more united. If they are united then that can help each other out and maybe even build friendships. People may disagree with that and say that not all facial expressions are the same, but, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression,"" they are still universal. While one student might be stressing himself out and have wide eyes, a student next to him might just have his eyebrows furrowed. If the computers identify the differences in actions but similarities in emotions, that can really help students.

The Facial Action Coding System is a huge leap in the computer world, and also the education system. If schools took this software into consideration and allowed students to use it, it woud be very beneficial for everyone around them. Kids would get work that suited their abilities and they could get one on one time with the teacher if needed. If the teacher was busy, if the students were able to identify others' emotions from around them, maybe they would not feel so scared to go up to a classmate and ask for help. The Facial Coding System holds many beneficial factors that could help grow the education system and help individual students grow.",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

5266ddf,"Dear Senator,

The robust political system of the American government is greatly hindered by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isn't completely representative of what citizens really want. History will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elector who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please.""

(Paragraph 11)

Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting.

Time and time again, we have been shown that the Electoral College is nothing but a gimmick and ""a compromise between election of President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

(Paragraph 1)

by the founding fathers. Maybe that had worked in the past, when the population was statistically low compared to today, and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media avaliable, like the internet and television. But, it is not working today. The 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system. ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

(Paragraph 9)

Therefore, this is an obvious majority of citizens who agree with me. The Electoral College is almost universally despised, and not considered the most effective way to elect a President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""

(Paragraph 13)

This is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count. Unless you're in a swing state, your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Every legal American deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true, meaningful vote.

Claims by supporters of the Electoral College are not effective. In fact, one writer finds Swing States to be a good thing! Yes, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign--to really listen to the competing candidates--knowing they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""

(Paragraph 20)

Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election. This writer is implying that the small state votes are useless, and that the voters in them don't even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote! As a former resident of a politically smaller-impact state, I know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting. Putting thought into a vote isn't just a thing people do in large states.

Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.""

(Paragraph 14)

A concerned citizen.    ",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

53be578,"Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the president(Source 1). This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. Some say the electoral college is good because it prevents ties or because it will make sure there is a winner. But if they can over rule your vote are you really voting for your president? I say the electoral college is a bad system and it needs to be extinguished.

There is no doubt that you should get to decide who your leader will be. And if the electoral college can over rule your vote do you really feel like it's your decision? In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush instead(Source 2). This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn't get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let's get rid of the electoral college!

Some others may say that they support the electoral college because it can't have a tie. ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality ina state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""(Source 3). It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.

""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""(Source 2). This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn't it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each canidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don't get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 ""qualified"" polititians that can over rule the entire country's vote. It's ridiculous how the system works and you are crazy if you support it. I know i want my fair share of input and the electoral college won't allow that.

There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids run-off elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral College...""(Source 3). In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people.

In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.

56e11a2,"Have you ever wanted to know exactly how somone is feeling? What if you were telling your friend a story and you truly wanted to know if they found it interesting? The latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe can detect the emotions of someone by calculating the way the subject's facial structure and muscles form the six basic emotions, which are happiness, surpries, anger, disgust, and fear. This system is called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and can be used for many different reasons. One example is in the cassroom. With the FACS, teachers will be able to read the emotional state of their students, plan/adjust lessons based on the readings, and bring a happier, more interesting experience to the classroom.

The FACS has the ability to read emotions based on muscles and face composition. Tests have been done on one of the most famous paintings in history, ""Mona Lisa"". While this technology can be trivial, as reading a painting-woman's face is not completely productive, it can be helpful towards teachers and students. If the teacher has the ability to truly understand and read their student's emotions, the teacher can switch up and have the ability to try something new. For example, if a student's structure reads that (s)he is confused, the teacher can either go more in depth into the lesson and explain further as to avoid any more confusion. This is exactly what Dr. Huang has predicted, saying that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" in paragraph 6.

Bringing the FACS into the classroom will not only allow teachers to see how bored and confused their students are, it can force the teacher to be innovative and creative in their lesson plans. If the teacher truly cares for their students' attention, (s)he would have to implement new ways to teach boring subjects, in which most students would clock out of otherwise. Most students dread long lectures and usually either stop paying attention, thus wasting both the teacher's and student's time, or forget most of the information. With the FACS, teachers will be able to detect signs of boredom and dread and then capitalize on their emotions with a new activity or fun game to lighten the students' moods, while also giving them the proper amount of information.

Much like the example above, there are ways for teachers to bring a lighter-toned, more fun energy to the classroom with this system. If the teacher sees that the students are boerd, in a lecture for exapmle, the teacher could implement a game or fun activity. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, as explained in paragraph 9, if someone is putting on a happy face, even if they do not mean it, they are subconciously happy and are having a good time. If the students are doing a fun activity together, they are surely going to smile, giving off positive vibes and general happiness in response to an otherwise boring lesson.

The FACS is a revolutionary way of processing emotions and can be really helpful for any student-teahcer learning environment. The system can allow teachers to read what their students are feeling, and can either hcange a lesson plan to reduce confusion, or implement activities or games to increase happiness and positivity during a dreadful lecture. The FACS in the classroom will help both teachers and students alike.",6,4.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 4**

3a2b8f0,"The electoral college must go down! The electoral college is unfair to voters across the United States and the amounts of electoral votes doesn't compare to the actual population. The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States. This system of electoral colleges voting for the president and not actually counting the votes that the people in the United States vote for, which makes it a very outdated system. Using popular vote is more precise and accurate than the electoral college. Popular vote is voted by citizens in which many people not including me should change the electoral system for the popular vote system. Therefore, the electoral college must go down and replaced by a system called the popular vote to determine the president of this great country.

Having electoral voters instead of having the popular vote system is unfair to all. Basically the electoral college process consists of only a selection of the senators. The founding father have established this messed  up system in which it compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress. It is highly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. This means canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. For example, they only focus on the ""swing states"" like California. Using the winner-take-all system, smaller states don't get the same oppurtunity as bigger states as in the year of the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see any canidates at all including, Rhode Island and South Carolina which holds the largest media markets. Yet these states didn't get to see a single campaign ad in the designated area.

Not only that using this system is unfair to all, but this system of electoral votes don't compare to the population. Meaning the 500,000 voters in a state of Wyoming who wants the other president to win, only have one representative to cast that vote in that whole state of that immense population. While California in the other hand have 55 representatives to cast the votes, in which the represent 35 million voters in that state. Using popular vote, is much more of a precise method or sytem to use. Instead of having one representative from one small state of 500,000 people, the popular votes turned in by qualified citizens will count than just 55 representatives. Imagine having each and everyone's vote count instead of having someone to do it for you. Now that is when people should start voting.

Using the popular vote will indeed avoid many crisis that happened using the electoral system. For example, the election that almost turned into complete disaster in the year of 1960 when Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent"". This couldv'e been easily fixed if the government at this time would take off the electoral system college and instead use a precise system that many people want, named the popular vote. Popular vote is basically when the people have ""the voice"" and speak for themselves and not to another person. Another example would be in the year 2000 when U.S. presidential race, Al Gorereceived more individual votes that George W. Bush nation wide, but Bush wonthe election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. With popular vote, Al Gore wouldv'e won the presidency and the citezens of the United States would've gotten what they wanted instead of having people vote for them. This is why population vote should be in effect as soon as possible.

Using popular vote would be a great and ideal way to decide who is the president during the nationwide election. It should be important to many people as we the people of the United States decide who will take over the countries' responsibility and economy. Yes, the popular votes is a great and ideal way to vote but having electoral colleges will avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. However, they can fix this problem by eliminating the electoral votes process. Therefore, it makes it clear that having a popular vote to deide who is the winner would be better when it is election time.

Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best. Abolish the electoral system college once and for all!            ",6,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of the electoral college and provides some evidence to support its position.

3a2ffd1,"Although there are advantages to having a smart car, the cars should no longer be developed. They should not be developed because the cars may assist but no car is completely driverless; The cars have several sensors but, still need full alertness of the driver just as a normal car would. The smart cars, by law, are not considered safe. In most states its illegal just to test smart cars.

Some may question wether the cars should be maufactured if they are not driverless. The smart cars require the driver to be fully alert so that they can take over in places where the car cannot drive it's self. Technology is something that help people do things more efficently, however, the smart car is not any more efficent than a regular car.

In most sates it is illegal just to test the cars, this is because the cars have not been proved reliably safe. If the cars are proved safe the law would then have to be changed to cover liability. In the case of an accident, who is at fult the car or the driver? This question could easily raise debate on wether the cars should be further developed because of the confusion and problems it could cause.

In some areas the cars can be tested. There have been no crashes in all of the testing but does this make up for all of the faults of the cars? Some may argue that the cars are benificial. If this is the case, how benifical are they? The fact that the cars are not consdidered ""safe"", that the cars are not driverless and that they are illegal all outweigh the potenital of the smart cars.

The cars should no longer be developed. The cars are not safe. Since they require as much attention as a regular car, they are not an enhancement to the tecchnology we already have.

3a74972,"Have you ever heard of the face on Mars? In 1976 the Viking 1 was going around Mars to look for a landing spot for Viking 2. They found something that looked to be a face. It was about 2 miles long in a region called Cydonia. The unusual shadows of the ""face"" made it look almost to be an Egyptian Pharaoh.

The scientists just figured it was another Martian mesa which were common to the region, but the caption took notes of a ""huge rock formation, which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Nasa decided to take a closer look.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture 10 times sharper than the original photo. It turns out it was just a natural landform. Not everyone was happy though, they say it was too cloudy to see if there were any alien markings.

Once again on April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took another picture on a cloudless summer day. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, says ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" The picture was so close that if there were anything on the ground we would've been able to see them. The picture shows the Martian is equivalent of a butte or mesa.

In conclusion, there were no alien momuments or anything weird happening. It was just a natural landform, although NASA wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

3ab54cd,"Computers are becoming more similar to humans over time, as new technologies are developed. One such technology allows a computer to recognize a person's emotions based on the movement of muscles in their face. Some say this technology can be used in the classroom to slow down a lesson for a confused student, or make it more interesting for a bored one. However, the truth is that while this technology certainly has its merits, it may not be reliable in the classroom because it cannot accurately determine a person's emotions, understand their cause, or properly respond to them.

Although fairly accurate at times, this software that detects emotions may not be always accurate. For example, according to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the software calculates that the woman in the famous painting ""Mona Lisa"" is ""2 percent angry."" This is likely untrue, and Leonardo da Vinci probably never intended this. She does not appear angry, and if anything, da Vinci simply could not recognize facial expressions well enough to accurately depict the emotions that he intended the subject of the painting to have. Additionally, the article states that there are six basic emotions the software can detect: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. These emotions are useful, but this also means the computer cannot detect emotions like guilt and confusion. These are very important emotions in the classroom, and the computer must be able to detect if a student cheats on a test or does not understand a concept. The software is very limited in detecting emotions, and this could lead to adverse consequenses.

Sometimes, not only are a person's emotions unclear, but the cause of a person's emotions may not be obvious given the current context, because people often live in the past. A student may appear to be confused, but only because the student does not understand a joke they heard before the lesson. The article says that the computer could recognize this confusion and modify the lesson, despite the fact that the student's confusion has nothing to do with the lesson in the first place. Also, if a student does not understand a certain part of the lesson material, the computer will not be able to detect the exact part; the student will be confused no matter what part it is. The computer will be forced to explain and clarify everything, when the student may only need a small part clarified. In a similar way, the student may still not understand the material afterwards, but the computer cannot ask the student why this is so, because it only detects the student's confusion.

While detecting emotions and their causes are important in the classroom, the most important thing is responding to them appropriately. For example, if a student is feeling sad, this will likely affect their retention of the material being taught. However, the computer likely cannot alleviate or eradicate this sadness, because it is most likely caused by an outside source. The computer may try to comfort the student, but the student will know that the computer does not actually feel any emotions and will not be comforted whatsoever. Additionally, the student may feel bored, but the computer may not be able to change this if the student feels that the material being taught is boring, because the computer has no choice but to teach this material to the student. As a result, even if the computer can detect a student's emotions, it may not be able to do much about them.

No matter how useful this emotion-reading software is, it should not be used in the classroom. It may falsely detect an emotion and change the lesson when unnecessary. It could also assume the wrong cause for an emotion, leading it to make a lesson longer or more thorough when the student understands it already. Additionally, the computer may detect emotions well, but it may not be able to fix them or change them, making the software pointless. Technology may have great benefits, but detecting emotions in the classroom is not one of them.",5,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue, but it does so inconsistently and with inadequate examples. The student provides some valid arguments against the use of emotion-reading software in the classroom, but these arguments are not always supported with sufficient evidence.

3acd644,"The face that NASA found on mars was not made by aliens. The Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and got better pictures than the Viking did and it showed that there was no alien monument, it was just a natural landfrom. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. Lastly the picture that the Viking took was not very good quality compared to the pictures took in 2001.

One reason that the Face on Mars was not made by aliens is because the Mars Global Surveyor got the best picture of it in 2001 and it just turned out to be a natural landform. In line 11 it says that ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he also added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

Another reason that the Face was not made by aliens is that the face is the equivalent of as butte or a mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. In paragraph 12 it compares the Face on Mars to the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The pictures that the

Mars Global Surveyor took in 2001 were a lot more clearer than the pictures took by the Viking in 1976. In paragraph 10 it says that Malin's team captured an amazing picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixal in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixal in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how bad the quality was in the 1976 photo taken by the Viking. Also, it proves that it was not a good photo and that the 2001 photo shows so much more and is way better quality. Other people might say that in the photo of '98, taken by the cmaera on board the MGS had to pear through wispy clouds to see the face, which made the alien markings hidden by the haze. Then the picture or 2001 proved that there was no alien markings and that the Face was just a landform.

In conclusion, this is why I believe that the Face of Mars was not made by aliens and is just a natural landform. First of all, The Mars Global Surveyor got better quality pictures than the Vikning did. Also, the 2001 picture shows that the Face is the equivalent to a mesa or butte, which are landforms that are common in the American West. Lastly, when you compare the '76, '98, and the '01 picture side by side you can tell that the '98 and the '01 pictures are more clear and show that the Face is just a landform.",5,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue, providing some critical thinking and evidence to support its position.

3b20650,"There are numerous mysteries of the world that mankind is only on the verge of solving.

From Stonehenge to the Great Pyramids of Giza, historians as well as the public has a surplus of both logical and outrageous theories as to where these icons began.

One example of this is the Face on Mars.

The Face has become a symbol of its own and many believe there to be a correlation with alien life.

However, I, as a scientist, am certain that the Face is simply a natural landform rather than an alien creation due to my knowledge that NASA has taken multiple pictures of the formation and reached this conclusion, NASA has no logical reason to hide evidence if it were present, and because planet Earth has similar formations found in nature.

In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor or MGS image depicted a shocking sight for those down on Earth.

According to ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", an article discussing the mysterious Face, ""...it[Viking 1] spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.""

After their initial reactions, the rational scientists arrived at the conclusion that the sight was in reality, ""...just another Martian mesa"".

They carried on to unveil the finding to the public who some of whom responded claiming the Face is certain proof of Martian life.

NASA has stood by their belief, taking numerous shots of the Face since the original spotting.

As recently as of April 8, 2001; newer photographs using the newest techonology have shown the Face for what it really is.

Jim Garvin, the chief scientist of the Mars Exploration Program, describes tthe intent saying, ""We felt this was important to taxpayers.

We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.

The clarity of these recent pictures is much improved upon those shot by the 1976 Viking.

In fact Garvin again claims, So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

True scientists understand that in order to prove a theory valid, one must utilize multiple data collections rather than one outlier.

NASA has indeed done so in the case of the Face on Mars.

Another reason for believing what I do is the fact that NASA is a professional organization which of course seeks funding and a fair reputation as much as anyone else.

Although many conspiracy theorists claim ""NASA would rather hide"" evidence of life on Mars, this could not be farther from the truth.

According to the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

This is completely logical as recently funding for NASA has only decreased, seemingly along with the public's interest in space exploration.

This being the case, why on Earth would it be sensible for NASA to attempt any sort of cover up regarding evidence of alien life such as the alleged Face on Mars?

Finally, to verify NASA's knowledge that the Face is just a natural landform, is the observation which no one can deny: our planet Earth is abundant in formations such as the Face.

In fact, the mesa which the Face really is, is fairly similar to those found on Earth.

These landforms are particularly common is the western region of North America.

In fact, Jim Garvin states, It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Although Mars and Earth differ is many ways, the two neighboring planets share similar land formations such as these.

The Face is but a specific example of this.

After examining NASA's numerous verification attempts through the means of photography, the fact that NASA has no known motive to hide the alleged ""evidence"", and observing our own planet and its characteristics, it is clear to see that the Face is indeed nothing more than a naturally-occuring landform.

Undeniably fascinating, the Face on Mars is similar to many other wonderous works of nature.

As humans, it is only natural to find these perplexing and interesting.

However, science should not be refuted by simple fascination.

Instead, science should be utilized as a tool to explain the source of these out-of-this-world discoveries.",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

3b755b3,"In the excerpt, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author does not support their idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers it presents, all to well, they start off by listing several details that correspond with the exploration of the planet. Such as details of the physical state of the planet in correlation to Earth, but then list the dangers of Venus itself, plans that are backed by science to give human life a CHANCE, but not ideal living conditions on the planet.

To begin, The author starts off supporting their idea of Venus being worthy of exploring by writing about how Venus is somewhat similar to Earth, in the physical aspects, they state the Venus is often referred to ""Earth's Twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" They describe how long ago Venus was, ""Covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth,"" but they do not mention or go into detail as to what happened to the lakes, as a reader I'm curious as to what happened to the planet, and why it is the way it is today. The author also incorporates a description of the landscape on Venus, they write, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as Valleys, Mountains, and Craters,"" the description of the landscape sounds interesting because it is being described sort of like the Grand Canyon, because of the mountains, valleys, and other physical aspects.

Furthermore, the author begins to dive into to the several dangers that go with exploring Venus, they describe the atmosphere as, ""Almost 97 percent carbon dioxide."" In my opinion a world with an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide does not sound like the most fun thing. Also being described by the author are the clouds that coat the planet and are filled with, ""Highly corrosive sulfuric acid,"" to me as a reader this sounds more like a death wish rather than a ""worthy pursuit.""

More dangers that the author lists, is the temperature and the atmospheric pressure. ""Temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times higher than what we experience on our own planet. these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarineaccustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans, and liquefy many metals."" Those few sentences do not support the claim and idea made by the author that it would be a worthy pursuit. along with blazing temperatures and crushing pressure come with, ""erupting bolcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightening strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

Next, the author continues their ideas with a plan made by NASA, where scientists would ""explore"" by living in a blimp-like structure that hovers about 30 miles above the planets surface. Even 30 miles above the ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close the that of sea leavel on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but, survivable for humans."" Being in the blimp hovering above the planet would be pointless due to the atmosphere being so dense that most forms of light cannot penetrate it. also stated by the author is, ""More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" However, the author states that NASA is working on taking different approaches to studying the planet by using, ""Technology called mechanical computers....these devices played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.""

Lastly, the author does not support his/her ideas of ,""Venus being worth of pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" the author does list several benefits and interesting facts of exploring the planet, but unfortunatly in my opinion the dangers greatly outweigh the risks in physically being on the planet. Now if they conveyed exploring the planet from a far, and with robots and not actual people then I would be all for it. ",6,3.0,,":**

3b82d2b,"Driverless cars should not be used on open roads due to the extreamly dangerous potental the driverless car has. If you were to get in a car accident who would be to blame ? The car or the driver ? The computer of the car could have so many errors that could potentally injure another human on the roads.

The dangerous potental the car has is, it can accelerate on its own. Imagine you're going down 267 here in Plainfield. You're in a driverless car and the car begins to accelerate, however it doesnt meet a constant speed. As the car continues to go faster and faster, its to late to stop because you already rearended the car infront of you. Causing the person in the car infront of you to spin out of controll and hit a telephone pole. Because of a computer error in the car an inicent bystander's life has been taken. That there just shows the potental danger the driverless car has just due to the ""auto acceleration"" programing in the car.

In that car crash you have to give the poliece your insurance redgerstration ext. When you file the insurance claim whos fault it the accident? Yourself or the car manufacturers? You could try to blame the manufacture however you're probably not going to get to far. It's not their fault the computer of the car had a glitch. There is nothing they can do about it. So now you could potentally be charged with wreckless driving and vehicular manslotter, even though you didn't intentually kill the person. Your insurance is most likely going to say it was your fault for not having controll of the car. Who is to say it was infact the car and not your fault? That's just the problem exactaly .

Technology fails everyday so why put it in a car and put human lives at risk? Using the heads-up system is a good idea however it could also fail resulting in the faitality of another human. Using the heads-up system could get the attention of the driver to let them know that they need to take over. What happens when the driver doesnt take over and the car continues to have a mind of it's own. Again possiable resulting in an accident and a possiable faitality.

Admitting that technology is a great advantage and is used everywhere today. The point is greater technology than what we have now should stay off the roads. Keeping technology off the roads can save lives and prevent accidents waiting to happen. The danger of auto accelaration, heads-up system, and not knowing whos fault the accident was your's or the car's, is absalutely not worth the life of a human.              ",4,2.0,,":**

3bbcac0,"The president of the United States should be decided by the Electoral College process, not by most popular vote. There are many reasons why we should keep the way we vote the same.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in it's Congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of Representatives and plus two for your senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. When we vote this way, there's a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign effforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Ellectoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constistution.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

We definatly need to continue using the Electoral College process. The most popular vote process wouldn't be an ideal way to elect a president.

There may be material on Venus that will better the lifes of people on earth. Though traveling to venus can be very dangerous or even fatal with temperatures average of eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit.

3c22d23,"Luke Bomberger had got asked to join this program called '' Seagoing Cowboys.""

He was working at two part time jobs, one of the jobs were grocery store and the other one was the bank. Then, Lukes friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to the cattle boat in Europe. Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then he thought, that would be the opportunity of his lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. He also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together. Fourty-Four nations joined in on this program. The name of the program was called ""Seagoing Cows"" because they took care of the horses, young calfs, mules that were on there way over seas. Europe needed despirate help when this incident happened.

Acording to the story, on August 1945, they arrived on August 14th. On that day the Pacific War ended. They had a cargo with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned 18 when he was onthe cattle boat headed towrds Greece, and that meant he could be drafted to the military services! By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke Bomberger had made nine trips, then he got told that he had the most Seagoing Cowboys trips in the program!

Luke always said ""the cattle-boat trips were so unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy!"" Besides helping people Luke had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special, Luke said. He enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up his world to help people and be kind and helpful to people who need help. A good reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you can relize how you have good towns and good houses and some countries don't have that. It shows how you canbe helpful and you need to be greatful for what you have and dont have!",1,3.0,,": The essay develops a clear point of view that Luke Bomberger's experience as a Seagoing Cowboy was more than an adventure; it was an opportunity to help people and see the world.

Like tomorrow this can't be stoped people are going to make cars that can drive them selves.

But cars that drive them selves would be a tariable thing for this world.

Driverless cars would not be good because a computer can not react like a human can, we would loose jobs and this would effect the economy, and because they limmit the freedom of the passanger.

Driverless cars would not be a good thing because a computer does not react like a human.

Humans naturaly have a reflex that a computer doesn't, we see something run into the road and we know weather to slam on the breaks (in the case of a child) or run over it in hope you don't hit it (in the case of a squwarl).

A computer could mistake these suck objects and thus causing another problem of is it ""the driver or the manufacturer"" (10).

Also in the case where the car would control the speed of the car.

Say you were driving a woman to the hospidle because se is going into labor, or someone needs medical attenshion and you need to drive them there.

In cases such as these going the speed limit is not the best thing.

You would need to go over in order to save or help the person.

For reasones like this a computer as a driver would not be a good idea.

In the state of Indiana the manufacturing of car is one of the economical exports that we have.

If you were to take all those jobs and take them out to California to build driverless cars, that would hurt the economy of Indiada.

Also what about other formes of trancportation that require a driver?

The taxies of New York, or the local buses that run all over the country? what would happen to bus drivers jobs, would they all be replaced with driverless cars? For that reason of hurting the economy driverless cars would not benifit America.

Driverless cars also would restrict the freedoms of the individuwal.

Say you were of a drive and you wanted to go throught backroads to see the landscape, would the driverless car take you there or would it take you on the main highways? In these driverless cars how would the passanger be incontrol at all? Technology may be atvancing in many ways than one but I don't want the way I travel to be restricted.

Driverless cars would be horiable because computers can't react like a human can, we would loose jobs and it would effect the economy, and because they limmit the freedom of the passanger.

For all these reasons we should not have driverless cars.

Pluse haven't we seen enought movies where there are driverless cars and robots walking the streets that take over the world?

Variouse movies have been created like these and every day we come closer to robots taking over the world. I don't want that and I think we should provail it as much as possiable starting with the driverless cars.  ",4,2.0,,":**

The election should be chosen by popular vote afterall it is the peoples ""say"" who runs there country.

In the electoral college who really has a voice apparently not the people.

We have discovered the decision isn't in  the people hands , but did we think about how ""the electors could always defy the will of the people"" in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" author Bradford Plumer says , and he makes a valid point no matter if your candidate wins by a landslide the electors still choose who becomes president.

Another reason why the electoral college should be changed into popular vote is because each has a diffrent amount of electors. If you thought not being able to actually your president was wrong, but what about your state having fewer or more electoral votes ,and thats the deciding factor on if your candidate wins.  Author of the "" The Indefinsible Electoral College"" Pulmer states ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voter, because of the winner-take -all system in each state,candidates dont spend time in states they know thaey hace no chance in winning"". The electoral college should be done away with imediately not only is the democratic system is not so democratic , but its not letting the peoples voice be heard.

Futhermore it is evident that the election should be based on popular votes. And if its based on popular votes the people voices will be heard , and they will actually have a say in which candidate wins . And isn't that why America is so special because it lets peoples voices be heard. Dont take that distinctive factor away because it makes

3d098ec,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, and does not prove that there is alien life on Mars. The Face was created simply by poor camera quality and an optical illusion. The later pictures of the Face taken in 1998 and 2001 prove this theory even further. If you look at the later pictures, you can clearly see that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation. NASA is also in support of finding alien life, so they would have no reason in trying to disprove that aliens are not real. So, the face is nothing more than an optical illusion, and not something created by aliens.

The Face on Mars is nothing more than an optical illusion and a natural formation working together. If you look at the picture of the Face from 1976, then it is very convincing proof that the face was the work of aliens. However, the picture of the Face that was taken in 2001 shows that the Face is simply a rock formation with shadows where the eyes and mouth should be. This is also proven with the picture that was taken in 1998. Even though there is clouds over the Face, you can still tell that there is no alien creation in the picture. Garvin brings up a comparison of the Face to a ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" which is a ""lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" By drawing this comparison, it gives us something we can easily compare the Face to on Earth. People don't claim that the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain"" was created by aliens, yet it is easily comparable to the Face.

Alien life on Mars would support NASA. It would bring great attention to the space program, and more funding. If NASA were to find aliens, they wouldn't hide it from the public. Whenever the picture was first taken in 1976, NASA released it to the public only a few days after it was taken. Although the picture had a theory to disprove that it was the creation of aliens along with it, NASA still released it almost immediatly. This is proof that NASA is in support of finding alien life becuase they were not afraid to release something that could possibly prove it. Even after NASA ended the Viking missions, they still went back to take more photos of the Face. This would either prove the conspiracy theorists even more, due to advancments in technology which would allow for higher resolution photos, or it would prove NASA's theory that shadows were creating the optical illusion. The pictures helped the case of the latter. Because of how much clearer the picture taken in 1998 is compared to the picture taken in 1976, you are able to see much more detail of the Face, and can easily tell that it is just a mesa. Conspiricy theorists claimed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze in the picture, which would later be disproved by the very clear picture taken in 2001. So, if NASA were not in support of finding alien life, why would they release three pictures that could possibly prove alien life?

In conclusion, the face was not created by aliens. NASA is also not trying to hide any evidence for alien life on Mars, so if this were the creation of aliens, NASA would fully support it. NASA released three photos of the Face, all which had the possibility of proving that it was the creation of aliens, yet they still released them. So, if NASA wanted to hide alien life, why would they release anything to hint at it?",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

3d100f8,"The future holds many great things but one thing that isn't on that list would be driveerless cars. Just thinking about it brings danger, with people inside a car without a real driver can cause many accidents. In the future I feel like our death population will really rise up because of self driven cars. How are they going to know when to turn or what to do in a bad situation. Driverless cars is going to be a very nad idea.

Why do we need driverless cars there is absolutely no point in it. Just so people dont have to drive and they can be lazy. Or because just in case if someone is tired and can't drive much longer. Well would you rather drive your self than a robot car that for sure has no idea what other people can do. Because when people drive and someone is next to them they can tell when they are shifting over but a driverless car can't because all it can do is tell whats behind and in front of it not to the sides. With this idea I am definitly not for it becasue I will rather walk it is just to dangerous and I do not want to take the chance. If they give me an oppurtunity to drive a driverless car and a self controlled one I would rather go with a self controlled one. Now by the time the driverless car is invented I moght be dead. But I would rather be dead from something else than a driverless car.

America has had many deaths and a lot of that is because of cancer, car wrecks, and other sickness and if the driverless car is invented I feel like it would turn into the top ten death causes. No will understand how many causes we will have with them. And im not just looking out for the people bt also google. Google will be a lot of debt off because people will be sueing them all the time. Before they make this a final decision they might want to look into the future because of all the teens also. Teens will play a big role into that and that could cause a lot of damage.

Who ever made this idea is a smart person I will give them credit in inventing something that can drive itself around, but I will also give them credit when it's there car that has caused the most deaths in the world. Plus what if someone tells them to go somewhere and they fell asleep and didn't notice the robot went the wrong way and the person would end on the complete opposite side of a town or even a country. You never know how smart the car can be. And if it was up to me I would not be one of those people who would buy a driverless car.                    ",4,2.0,,"**

3d37941,"Driverless cars are something we've envisioned and witnessed before in entertainment shows or movies. However realistically these cars are not something I would want in our every day lives. Many reasons contribute to my thoughts on this, some being that they will be very expensive, unsafe, and pointless for the driver.

These automated cars that can drive due to sensors, and 360 cameras with special high tech features all combine into one pricey vehicle. Buying such cars will not only empty our wallets but lead to annual cleanings, repairs, and more if a peice of technology gets damaged. As mentioned in the article, ""Dubbed LIDAR it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroudings."" The amount of money it would take to replace or refurnish this particular part would cost thousands if not hundreds of dollars. It creates an image so it can mimic the skill of a human at the wheel, without it the car is no longer driverless. Paying large amounts of money for a car that can drive itself and may even be unsafe anyways is a waste.

This leads into my second main point as to why these cars should not be supported. They are unsafe for both the people in the car and other drivers on the road. ""Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test driven cars."" This exerpt from the article alone proves that if various states are not comfortable with 100% computer driven cars that they should not be used or be on the road in the first place. Many computers or robots make mistakes, if one small malfuction were to occur during a trip, it could cause serious injuries or fatalities to people on the road and the car itself. Driverless cars should not be trusted to handle everyday commutes to jobs or other places because they are unsafe.

With new cars that can drive themselves it lacks for the younger generations to learn how to drive in the first place. Teenagers or young adults will not have the tendancy to take drivers ed courses because it is assumed that the car will handle all situations. However, all drivers should have basic knowledge when on the road. Driverless cars will lessen the amount of real driving with the upcoming generations.

Lastly, in the article it mentions that drivers must always be alert even with driverless cars. ""...all are designated to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" If the driver is required to sit in the vehicle and do nothing but stare at the road ahead, it is pointless to have the car drive itself when it should naturally be able to handle driving on its own. Not only will the driver be bored, they will also have the urge to take over instead. This completely defeats the point of having a driverless car if the driver is left with the same job.

Technologies are advancing and with so many different things being invented or modified we tend to forget that some things should just remain the same. Not only for the safety of others but for the knowledge of others that will soon be driving like the rest. Driverless cars should not be allowed merely because it cannot truly mimic and take control of unexpected situations like a human can.             ",5,3.0,,": The essay develops a clear point of view that driverless cars should not be supported.

3d441b0,"Many studnets use computers in class but ther is also a large portion that do not on a day to day basiss. The thought of computers being able to read expressions is pretty fasinating, however seem unnessisary. Like hummans computers make mistakes; the Facial Action Coding System could inaccutartly change a lesson plan, missread an expression, or not pick up an expression .

At school students do get bored, but the teacher does not change the lesson plan so why should the computer. All the evidence is a prediction with no hard evidience backing it; ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts"". In class students ask questions or go to a teacher when they do not get it so a computer would not be much of a help unless it was for kids who did online school and did not have a teacher helping them through the lessons.

Most students are not nessisarly excited about school so they quite regularly wear a bored expression throughout the day. Not to mention ""each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no expression)"". Some kids just do not show emotion especialy older kids who just want to get what needs to be done finished. What if a kid is genuinly confussed and the computre missreads the expression. that could either cause more confussion as the lesson goes on or make the lesson too easy.

Computers make errors all the time they are no where near perfection. What if the computer does not have the sennsors to pick up expression. It is not like every school or home schooled student is going to go out and buy a computer that can do the same thing a parent or teacher can do. This invention ""stores similar anatomical information as electronic code"". The Facial Action Coding System is amazing to show expressions in art work, but not for students.

While coputres do aid us at many things there are somethings that should just be left to us to do. Students get confused and bored by many things but that can all be fixed by a little bit of help. If the student is really that confused then maybe that program is not for them. As well as if the student does not show emtion while doing work on the computer.

3d9c7b9,"As a young child peers into the endless night sky from his bedroom window, a bright flickering spot catches his eye and leaves a single question in his mind: ""Is there anybody there?"" In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author writes about that same bright spot, known as Venus, and explains that studying this planet will real human scientists is worth it despite the many obstacles it raises. By including staggering information of the endless hazards and later reassuring their readers with astonishing facts and likely solutions to survival, the author clearly supports their ideas very well. There may just be a chance for us to see Venus as more than just a bright little star after all.

Initially, the author puts more focus to the first half of their claim as they describe the dangers of this not-so-easy planet. The author informs us that even mighty submarines would not stand a chance in the undoubtably strong Venusian atmosphere; they continue to say that most metals would simply melt under its pressure (paragraph 3). By including such daunting information that makes human life anywhere near Venus seem impossible, it can easily be seen that the author supports that Venus is no cake-walk. Also in paragraph three, the author includes ""additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes"" in the background of Venus's already packed daily weather forecast. The author used these earthly disasters and explained how they happen regularly on Venus to prove just how many abstacles there are for scientists who wish to go to the planet, furthure showing their understanding of the idea that putting humans of Venus could be very harmful. Thankfully, exploring this scary planet has its hopeful side.

Near the middle of this passage, the author begins to turn Venus, no pun intended, and the conversation on taking humans there to a more positive angle. In paragraph four, the author writes about how Venus most likely used to be much like the place we currently live; it had amazingly Earth-like characteristics like huge oceans, mountains, and possibly even life similar to ours. With such exciting facts that leave even more questions about the mysterious planet, the author is proving to us that they know Venus has secrets worth uncovering. The author later tells the readers of a plan by NASA to make is possible to harbor human scientists near the Venusian surface by using a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles [above Venus]..."", informing that the situation would in fact be viable for life (paragraph 5). The author showed how they highly agree with the part of their idea that analyzing Venus up close should happen by giving a reassuring soulution from such a well known and trusted organization as support. Exploring our planet's twin seems like it's not such a giant leap anymore, rather, it looks like it will only take a few small steps.

Keeping all of this information in mind, it is clear that the author is a firm beleiver that Venus, although it has put many seemingly impenatrable obstacles in our way, is worth taking a look at with human eyes. If we follow calls to action such as this, we will put the human race just that much closer to understanding the mysteries of the infinite universe around us, but Venus is a good starting point. As a young boy's eyes slowly slide shut, he can still see a tiny flahing light shining through the darkness outside his window blinds; he dreams of the day he can finally meet it.",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue of exploring Venus, arguing that it is worth the challenges despite the obstacles.

3dcaf37,"Exploring Venus has its pros and cons. Both have its challenges and risks. Venus is a very interesting planet to study due to the fact that it is the only one like earth, but there are risks. throughout this essay I will tell you my reasoning on why the author didn't exactly prove to me that Venus is worth taking risks for.

It states in paragraph two,"" Each mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in the more than three decadeas."" This peice of evidence shows that Venus is not a safe enviroment for electronics to land on so why would you potentially send humans to this planet even though a spacecraft couldn't surive. This statement also had no followup counterarguement; there was no sentence to make me want to change my mind.

It also states in paragraph three,"" On the planets surface, temperatures avergae over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" This piece of the paragraph again identifies the risks but now into more detail. There is no followup counterargument, so again this author is making me completely against the idea of sending life to Venus.

It states in paragraph four,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This statement is one of the only pros that I have encountered from the author so far. This makes me think that this could be a good idea, especially due to the fact that Venus has some of the same features of earth.

The author then goes on to say,"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as out jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At the thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit. But the air pressure would be close to that of se level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This paragraph finally gives a safe solution to exploring Venus in a habitable way. However in the sixth paragraph the author states,"" Therefor, scientists seeking to conduct a throrough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This statement shows how the trip to Venus would be a waste of time if you cannot get on the surface. There is no point doing this exploration because any human life will not survive if you get too close to the surface.

In conclusion the author did not convinve me that traveling to venus is worthy expidition. The author mainly explained the cons of the study and did not provide too many pros. The author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

3e1faa5,"Not one human has ever seen a living species in Mars or in any planet. In 1976 an odd feature appeared on Mars. Many people think that it looks like a human face. These people believe that the odd feature could be an alien living on Mars.

The news has been spreading around that the ""face on Mars"" is a creature living in space. I don't believe that aliens are real. Aliens are a figure that someone made up a long time ago hoping that their were more people in the Universe. I know this because if there were aliens in the Universe, someone probably would have already found one.

A lot of odd objects float around in space. The face that people are seeing could just be a meteor. Meteors float around the Universe just trying to make problems. The meteor could have blasted into Mars and created the face like feature. Things like this are not very rare. Meteors have rocketed into Earth a great number of times.

I also believe in Jesus. I believe in every single detail the Bible says. The face could be Jesus showing people that he is watching us. Everything in the Bible has either already happend or will happen in the future. Aliens are not in the Bible, therefore, I don't believe they exist.

If aliens really do exist we would have already found one. Humans have thought aliens are real for hundreds of years. The object could be a natural object like a meteor. Meteors pass through the Universe every single day. What makes this object different? Nothing make the object different. Jesus Christ has all of the creatures we need to know about in the Bible.

3f4fcbb,"Are driverless cars safe? Majority of the world drives cars. Cars are used to get you from point a to point b. Cars are an example of moblie transportaion. Driverless cars shouldn't be on roads because they aren't safe, they seem too risky, and driverless cars are exspensive.

Firstly, driverless cars aren't safe. Driverless cars sound like a good idea but what if they cause trouble? According to the passage it states,"" Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers,

passengers, and pedestirans safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" If drivers aren't alert when driving driverless cars then it would cause a lot of accidents. In some states it's illegal to test computer driven cars.

Secondly, driving driverless cars seems too risky. You have to be alert when operating a driverless car, and this means you can't drink and drive. When you drink and drive in a driverless car you're putting yourself and others around you in more danger. If your driverless car's technology fails you could get injured and so could your passengers with you. Driverless cars need to be proven safe before they actually hit the roads.

Lastly, driverless cars are exspensive. The ""smarter cars"" would be really exspensive if they ever hit the market. If making the cars was so exspenive, imagine buying a driverless car. Cars that operate with a driver are also exspensive but they most likely cost less than driverless cars. Driverless cars shouldn't be worth your money.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be on roads because they aren't safe, they could cause trouble, and their exspense could be really high. Driving cars is a responsibilty. If you don't take driving seriously you could get yourself in trouble and you can hurt or injure others. According to the article it states,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.""

I think that being able to read students emotions could be a very good thing. Most people think hiding their emotions is better for them and sometimes it works but I think if teachers could read their students it could help with so many things. It could help teachers know when their students aren't doing well. When kids get upset they usually tend to not want to talk about their issues. This invention would help a lot in my opinion because if kids are wanting to harm themselves teachers acn get the kids help so that it doesn't happen.

3fb4405,"Dear Mr. Senator:

Lately there's been a problem regarding electoral colleges. Some people are in favor of them; others not so much. I agree with the latter; electoral colleges are anachronistic and should no longer be used in this day and age.

In this modern era, people are being more aware or more educated about the going-ons in government. As a result, it is becoming no longer necessary to have others vote in place of the people's choices. Instead, people should be able to vote directly for their chosen leaders and not have to worry about an elector making a last minute decision to vote for another.

Those who are in favor of electoral colleges are wrong about keeping them. In only half-way allowing people to vote for president, it could also be viewed that the people were never really given a choice. Their votes are at the mercy of the electors.

If you are wise Mr. Senator, you'll choose to do away with electoral colleges. By doing so, you give people more choice and control over their decisions. I hope you'll put your foot down on this matter and refuse to have anything to do with electoral colleges because they're not helping the future of our country,

As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city, Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Dieseles make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, uneven, pitten sidewalks, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from incipient shift in America behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center said that differents things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long term cultural shift. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the porcentage of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age.

In conclution it has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation is the second largeest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. It also has negative implications for the car industry but America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis.            ",2,4.0,,": The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue of limiting car usage in cities and suburbs.

406731a,"The electoral college system has been part of America for many years. At times, this system has proved to be a good thing for our country, but in most times, it has not. I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I am in favor of changing to a popular vote because of the unfairness, faulty aspects, and electors in the electoral college.

To begin, the electoral college is fair in some ways, but mostly not. One may understandably say that ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"" (Posner, 22). The electoral college has proved to be a balance to the political weight of the large states, but regardless of the size of the state, it should be a citizen right to vote directly for their president. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plumer, 13). This quote shows the unfairness to the voters, those in the smaller/more insignificant states don't even matter because of the electoral college! When voting, citizens also become confused with the electors, and potentially vote for their opposing party. Not only is the electoral college unfair for the voters, but for the presidental canidates as well. We as citizens vote for electors whom we must entrust to vote for the party's nominee. This trust is rarely betrayed, but ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral bote will not win the national popular vote"" (Posner, 16). In 2000, the election with Al Gore and George Bush, Gore won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral vote. The people wanted Gore to be the president, but he did not win, due to the unfairness of the ellectoral college.

Another reason I am in favor for the popular vote, is because of the faulty aspects of the electoral college system. A counterargument may be that the electoral college has held our country together, making the voting system a lot easier. But in my opinion this is not true. With popular vote, the citizens would just vote for the president, and whichever canidate recieves the most votes would win. But in the case of the electoral college, states cast only one vote for the entire state! "".. the single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California"" (Plumer, 12). The reason this is such a big deal is because, let's say that 10,000 people voted in Wyoming. 5,001 were republicans, and 4,999 were democrats. The electoral college would pick the elector representing the republican candidate. Thus, Wyoming's vote goes to the republican canidate. Without the ellectoral college though, those 4,999 votes would count, and would go toward helping the desired canidate win. Voting is an individual effort, and the electoral college does not allow for this.

As well as this fault, another fault is the fact that the electors could be anyone. ""They can be anyone not holding public office... Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer, 10). Although in most cases the electors vote for the correct party, an elector still may not be trustworthy, or loyal. They may even be bias and vote for a different candidate. The electors do not campaign. Only the presidental canidates do. When we vote for the president, we are actually voting for the electors. Voters normally know little, to nothing about the electors. This makes for an even faultier voting experience.

To conclude, electoral colleges are not the way the voting system should be. With popular voting, there will be an assurance that the right candidate will win, the unfair ways of the ellectoral college will be diminished, and there will no longer be any faulty aspects of the voting system. Citizens vote to be heard, and with the electoral college, the people aren't heard as loud as they should be. Voting is a right and priveledge of an American citizien, and popular voting will ensure this right.    ",6,4.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 4**

40aaa0e,"What's wrong with the electoral college is that voters do not vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who, in turn, elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. To be picked depends on the state, some have conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the president pivked the electors themselves. The disaster factor is when we vote the electors can change their mind, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for who ever they pleased. I feel changing to election by popular vote is better because if a president wins, its because more people voted for him, not an elector.

The electoral college is unfair to voters because the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in state they have no chance of winning. In an event of a tie, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives, where the state delegations would vote on the president, and the Senate would choose the vice president. In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hwaii had voted the oter way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.    ",2,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

Rosenthal says ""street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in tihs experimental new district on the outskirts of Feriburg, near the French and Swiss borders"" they only have two large garages for car-owner at the edge of the development, but they must pay $40,000, along with a home. 70% of Vauban's families do not own a car, and 57% sold a car to move there.

413d044,"The use of driveless cars can be defined as a statement of stupidity in your world today. They are not the way to the future as what this article say it is. All people need to have complete contorl of the wheel at all times. We learned that at a very young age and it needs to stick with us.

My position on this blanketed idea is that we in America should not have this type of car. There are many reasons for this ordeal. In the use of a drivelss car, many people would think to not even have to worry about driving the car since it can do it by themselves. So what happens if the car malfuncitons and the driver is asleep, then what happens, a crash, a death. That is a one reason on why we should not have these cars.

Another reason would be, the income and cost on these cars. The article doesn't state this material, but in order to make these cars so that they are drivelss, it would cost a lot more money than making an ordinary car. And the manufature has to sell it, so people are going to spend a lot more money than they have to on a car that they can drive by themselves. The money is not worth the risk.

Also google has stated that the car is not in complete control, a driver in needed. So, by this statement if a driver is needed then why do we need drivless cars if a driver is needed. Do we need them so people can text and call when they please, we have bluetooth cars for those situations. Also GM has pointed that, that in order for a car to be in complete control of the wheel, it needs roads that can read it's binary code. The government will not settle for any smart-road system because of how much it would cost.

The best reason out of all of them would be, who would be responsible for the crash, the car or the driver. If there were no such thing as driverless cars, then the situation would be taken care of right away, there would be no contraversy. Since now that we have these cars the quesiton is thrown up into the air, was the driver driving at the time of the crash, or was the car in it's automotive estate. In later days, this brings up court ruling and huge contraversy in which no one wants to be apart of. Just another good reason why we should't have driverless cars.

These cars today, that the world is making, that are driveless are absolutly dangerous in lives of the people. Injuries could come way to often with malfuntions inside the vehicle. Also the cost of roads and the car itself is extremely high. No one wants to pay for that unless your rich. And also, contraversy between the car and the human involving a crash would bring up big headlines. The world needs to stay with a human driving a car. It is safer, less expensive, and also easier to handle by the law. ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument against the use of driverless cars.

418f0dc,"Cars have always been known for their efficiency, and speed at which they bring their driver to his or her desired destination. Although, many people are aware of the causes of driving and the negative effects of a car, most never look at the possibilities. They don't know what they are being deprived of due to the simple, solvable problem of driving cars. As countries of the world experience a cultural shift in their daily lives, people are becoming aware of the significant advantages of limited car usage, including lower emissions, increased physical activity, and decreased stress, which in turn would increase overall pleasure.

With a change in one's daily life, the linear relationship between car usage and carbon emmissions, means that as car usage decreases so does pollution. In ""The End of Car Culture,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal comments on the scientific opinion regarding this cause and effect relationship in America: ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" Cars are a large contributor to the increasing amount of waste and toxins that make one's air water polluted. Therefore, with a drop in the usage of cars, people and land will be become healthier and cleaner. Emissions are also a problem in Europe where the ""Day Without Cars"" was used to promote ""alternative transportation"" in order to reduce ""smog.""(Selsky) Cars are often used get to specific places such as work or school. So why would two people drive two seperate cars if they're going to the same place? By using public transportation such as a bus or subway, one is killing two birds with one stone by using a smaller amount of gas and fossil fuels to delivery two people to their desired locations, a smarter and cleaner choice.

The limit on car usage has also caused an increase of physical activities within a society. The lack of cars has created the desire for outdoor involvement as Andrew Selsky suggests in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" when he informs people of the ""improvement caimpaign in Bogota"" that has enouraged the ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths."" Since space is no longer needed for the creation of parking lots, people now have ample room to create the resources needed for activities such as bike riding. Just having things such as trails visible to the public, motivates people to be active. The possibilities of physical activity areas are also encouraged by a change in the transportation bill. In current years, a drastic ""80% has gone to highways"" whereas only ""20% went to other transport.""(Rosenthal) With a decrease in the demand for cars and similiar ways of private transportation, there won't be a need for large highways. Since more money is now available to be used elsewhere, oppurtunities for parks and sports centers are opening up.

Although many may not be aware, a decrease in cars also brings a decrease in stress. This is even hinted at by ""Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza"" when he says ""'It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress...""(Selsky) Although people depend on cars for quick transportation, it can become a hastle when traffic comes into play. It also costs people lots of money when it comes to paying for gas, so an overall reduction of cars would fix all problems regarding stress. As a result of the reduction in car usage, several ""new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up,"" as Andrew Selsky informs the public in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" With an increase of space to build malls and social places, people have a better chance of staying relaxed and stress-free. Not only do these places enourage relaxation, but they provide a place for one to spend time with friends and family.

From driving hazardous and waste-producing cars to saving money, riding bikes, and hanging with friends at the mall, limiting car usage not only creates a healthier community but provides people with oppurtunities to be better. All around the world people are working to change their daily habits that have created the dirty world one lives in today. Limiting car usage creates an overall happier environment to live in and an endless amount of possibilities.    ",6,4.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 4**

13f75ec,"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College was created many, many years ago in the Constitution by our founding fathers, and now it is finally its time to retire. The Electoral College should be taken away and replaced by election by popular vote, in order to determine the president of the United States. The Electoral college should be abolished, because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are not treated fairly in this process. The United States strives to be a place of freedom and equality, but we as a country can not achieve this goals with this proccess in place.

The United States of America, is all about people protecting their rights, but how can that be if citizens are not even allowed to represent themselves with thier own votes. According to the Office of the Federal Register's article,""What is the Electoral College?,""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" Which means that our votes just choose people to represent our state and vote for us. So whats the whole point of voting in the first place? Is it just to make citizens feel like they are actually choosing the president. This proccess would not be a problem if the electors actually represented us correctly. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer, ""in 2000...Al Gore... won the popular vote but lost the presidencey,"" because of the electoral college. Plumer went on to quote a Gallop poll recorded after Al Gore lost which reported,"" over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to kind we have now."" Thats over half of the people voting! But the incident with Al Gore was not the only one, also according to Bradford Plumer's article,"" in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" In other words, they were trying to cheat and make sure the out come of the vote was what they wanted. People may argue that there have only been few instances of the Electoral College making mistakes, but how many more mistakes are they going to make in the future. Will there be so many, that our entire political system becomes corrupt. The citizens of the United States should be allowed to represent themselves with their own vote, and choose their own leaders.

How can the U.S. strive for equality, if states are not treated fairly through the process of the electoral college? The Electoral College process, is a winner-takes-all system, because of this, candidates spend their time only focused on specific states. States that are most populated, or that they think will be a ""swing"" state, basically any state that has a specific insterest to them and that will help their campaign. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" written by Bradford Plumer,""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This is a result of the faulty system, how are people suppossed to know who they want to vote for, if candidates won't even take the time to make a pitch to them? If the United States really wants equality, they need to start by having a equal state voting process.

At the end of it all, the Electoral College should be abolished because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are treated unfairly in the process. Help the United States continue to reach its goal of freedom and equality by abolishing the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

United States Citizen.    ",5,3.0,,":**

14174ed,"Facial recognition, a thing of the future, at least that's what people thought. With the new age of innovative technology, a special field of new technology has come to the public, facial recognition software. One of the most prominent softwares in the facial recognition field is the FACS, or facial action coding system, which is what was used to figure out exactly what emotion Mona Lisa was feeling in her painting. However, this software could be used in many other fields. The ability to read and detect what emotion some are feeling is very powerful and could be implimented into certain areas such as the classroom. The usage of FACS could be very beneficial to schools for reading students emtions so teachers could see how their learning plan affects the students, organize and figure out which subjects students may enjoy more, and also allow schools to see what areas of the school may need to be improved on the most.

By using facial recognition, teachers would be ablel to read the expressions on students' faces and see what their learning plan make the students feel. A prime example of how this could be used in the classroom would be in paragraph four, where the author states "" 'The facial expressions for each emotion are are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements."" This specific example is important because by using this software, the facial movements of every student could be tracked, without worry of missing something, and could therefore help teachers distinguish how all their students feel about their lesson plan. Along with that, in paragraph six the author states something similar to this main point ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is exactly what the point is, the computer could tell what needed to be changed and why.

Along with seeing how the teacher's plan affects the students, FACS could also potentially allow students to be organized and grouped up by what subject they appear to enjoy the most. Computers and computer programs are used most often for the usage and organiztion of data, that is what defines computer code, sets of data being used in certain ways. Well, the same type of usage could be had in a classrooom for organizing which subject students liked more. In paragraph five the author writes ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specfic emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical informatino as electronic code."" This points out that code already stores the data that it takes in and knows how to use it. That takes out a step in the process of using it in the class. By having it store data, the computer could then organize it into sections based on what students appeared more happy in certain classes and help with finding interests. Also, in paraghraph four the author states ""By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This is especially important due to the fact that sometimes students can feel mixed about the class they are in, which means the computer can help figure out how they may feel truly about the subject.

Above the learning aspect, schools could see where students physically feel the best or worst in the school or class. While the majority of use would be for the learning portion of the class, FACS could also be used quite often to help discern what physical things may need to change in the school. Maybe a student in a poor chair shows discomfort and the school learns it needs better chairs. In paragraph five, the author writes ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" While this is true, many people are able to easily figure out what a face may mean, the computer would have an even easier time doing it with lighting quick judgement and fast calculations to back it up. The usage of these quick calculations could be beneficial and allow the school to have a better input system and see exactly how the school feels, rather than relying on teahcers to figure out how the students may feel. Another good example of how the FACS could help improve school's physical aspects would be in paragraph six where the author uses and example of improvement themself by stating ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This example shows very well how the computer recognition could really tend to one's needs and how one feels, therefore helping improve the quality of the school.

Overall, facial recognition software is a very promising and prominent idea for the future of classrooms. The computer's ability to see how the learning plan affects the students and change the plan based on the response to the FACS being able to organize and find which subject the students like more in their school is extremely crucial to the new innovative learning process. Also by helping improve the overall quality of the school, the software is something that certain schools should look into. Hopefully this idea of facial recognition software in schools can become a reality and eventually become a nationally recognized function to aid in the learning process. Once an idea of the future brought into the modern day, the Facial Action Coding System truly has an eye for all things emotion.",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the use of facial recognition software in classrooms and provides relevant examples and evidence to support its claims.

141c149,"I do not think that there should be driverless cars. Driverless cars still need a driver in them. They also can drive around or know if a road is getting fixed. The cars could also be dangerous. These are reason why i think we should no have driverless cars.

First reason why we should have driverless cars, is because they cars still need to have a driver in them. The car should not be conicered driverless if they still need a driver to take over just in case of an accident ahead. The cars also do not have eyes can not see, how will it work at night. Also during the winter the driverless cars would have a lot of accidents because of snow and ice.

Second reason, is the cars would not know when there is a dead end or the roads are getting fixed. These cars could run off the road if a bridge was not complete. The computer hardware could go down in the middle of driving and people could died. These cars are not humans, and could kill lots of people because of simple mistakes.

My final reason is these cars can be dangerous because how would they know when children are running through the streets. These cars would not be safe around children or eldery people.

1423619,"The face on the plante of Mars was not created by aliens. Scientist have been studying this object for many years and with the new high-tech cameras and the new gear they have they are able to look at the picture very much more clear. The scientist have been studying and have recently just found out that it was just to be a mesa. The mesa is very common in Cydonia as it states in the article. It would make a tlot of sense if it would just be found out that it actually was.

The huge face was studied by Jim Garvin. He traveled to Cydoia to take a look at the face for his self. When he arrived by the huge mesa he took a very good picture to prove it was only a mesa and nothing more. Many people were not happy when they found out what Jim had to say. They were making statements that it was a winter day in that part of ""The Red Planet"" so it was very cloudy and so he probably just didn't see any of the symbols or signs that the aliens must have made.

The surveyor then went to Mars again in 2001 when it was all summer time by the huge mesa and he then took another photo. "" The photo was an extraordinary photo that was taken."" says Garvin himself. They eventually found out that it actually wasn't anything that the aliens have made but only a mesa.

Many other people or scientist might say that it is part of alien life because of where it was placed and how it actually looks. People say it is a sign from the aliens or martians. It is impossible for it to be from the aliens because it has been studied for years and years and photos have been taken multiple times to show that it was nothing more than only a mesa.

Aliens don't have the knowledge to know how to make a human face because they have never seen one before. How would an alien or a martian know what a human face looks like. They don't lnow so it couldn't have been from any alien activity

My ruling stands in what in know about the mesa that was found on Mars. People cant argue because it was scientifically proven that it is not a face on the face of the planet it is only a mesa. The mesa on the planet is only a natural landform that happens to look like a face. Nothing more and nothing less.",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument.

14d1bfc,"So the other day I was working at NASA just like everyday and something was brought up that I had never heard before. What was brought up was that back in the 70's, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a top region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The person who said this out loud said it was just formations called butte or mesa's which are very common around the American West. What happened was pretty normal at NASA. One of my co workers blurted out it was probably created by aliens. More people started agreeing with him because how else could a human looking face get on a planet that nobody ever talked about. It started to have me thinking about space and all the crazy things that happen, so I decided to do some research when I got home. I looked around the internet, and went to the public library to look for some books about rock formatons on different planets. Once I got those, I finally began research and what I found was shocking. I believe that the face on Mars is not and ancient alein artifact because rock formations form on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed.

I believe that the face found on Mars is not an ancient alien artifact because rock formations form on every planet. research has shown that the face found on Mars looksv like lanforms common around the American West. As far as people know, that face could have just gotten there from some sort of sand storm on the big red planet back in the 70's. Another thing that people shold know is that pictures can be deceving.

I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact because pictures can be deciving. What scientist knew back then, and what they know now is a lot different. There is much more technological advances now then there were back then, so the picture quality from space wasn't very good. It was very pixelated, not clear, and didn't give very much information. It is understandable that people thought it was an alien head but thats just not the truth. The picture quality now is at the highest its ever been so people can see pictures a lot more clearly. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That proves that the image was very deceving and not many people could figure out what it most likely looked like. One more thing that people should really know is that there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.

I believe that the face on Mars was not an anciet alien artifact because there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed. Back in the 70's people thought that aliens were real because the technology wasn't very good, and people olny believed what they were told. In the latest years though, Scientists have no evidence that aliens are real. This proves that there couldn't have been an anciet cicilization of aliens.

Because of these facts, I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact becaue rock formations can be found on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.",5,3.0,,"**

154607a,"The claim that the author supports the idea that studing Venus is worth pursuit despite the dangers because they maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decade. The dangers and pursuit are higly high risks for people and NASA.It is dangers because Venus is the secound planet from our sun and the atmosphere in Venus is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets. Even more challenging is that the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. On the plant surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. The despite to go Venus is that they are hoping to look for something their because the plant has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains,and craters. Somethings that we some how have they call Venus Earths sister. That why I think it so despite that NASA wants to see what else Venus got that the plants sister does not have.

An explanation of the article that supports my claims are when the author says this ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Also when they said ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""Venus is also dangers for people because it has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to our sun.""Beyond high pressure and heat,Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

My conclusion to the authors writting is that they will not end up sending people to Venus because its to risky. They will end up sending newer technoligi up their so that they could see what the sister of Earth got. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth -like planet in our solar system. Venus is most likely the most compared planet to Earth.

1549de8,"Senator of the State of Florida,

The Electoral College has been a part of our country since is was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers. Although it has been used for so long and some what effectivley, I believe that the act of changing the process to election by popular vote would benefiet the country and the residents more. Many poeple do think that the Electoral College is more fair and is better because of its certain outcome and other good aspects. My belief about the Elecotral College differs. I believe it is unfair and outdated, and I am not alone on that opinion.

An argument against the Electoral college is the disaster factor, information from the passage

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. In 2000, the biggest election crisis took place in a century. In 1960, segregationists almost had success in replacing electors with people who would benefiet them. Along with that, some electors may not be truthful and defy those who they are electing for and elect the opposer. All these examples come with fault in the system.

Another example from the same article claims that the idea of a tie is the most unsettling. The election would be put into the hands of the House of Representatives. An argument for the Electoral College claims the chance of a tie is very unlikely, but it has come close before. In 1968 and in 1976, a small shift would've cost the election. On the other hand, it would be much more difficult to tie a popular vote, seeing that there are far more citizens than electors for the college.

There are claims that the Electoral College is both fair and unfair for different reasons. People claim that it is fair because no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, when a popular vote might, from the article

In Defense of the the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. However, the process is unfair as well. In result of a winner-take-all system in the states, the presidental candidates don't spend time in states they know they don't have a chance in. This is unfair to voters because not all states get to see the candidates at all. Swing states have all the focus on them. These states are more likely to pay attention to campaigns. This is not fair because those running for the position will focus more on those states. With a popular vote, the candidates will want to contact each state to make sure those who reside there have paid attention to them and will hopefully vote for those people.

The process of the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and risky. There are so many opportuntities for disaster and a lot of unfairness all around. With people relying on the fact that the chances are slim or disaster is unlikely to happen is just not smart and there are things we can do about it. With a popular vote, a fair count is given and the president who more people choose will take office. Our country is a whole, and we treat the process of election like it isn't. Let the population decide and it's a fair trial; let a few electors decide and it could lead to disaster. Thank you.

Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes.

The residents are trying to make cities denser, and better for walking for the past two decades, so Vauban, home to 4,400 residents within a rectangularsquare mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It is either leave your cars at home or suffer with a fine of 22-euro on mondays with even-numbered license plates and the same with the odd-numbered plates the following day. Because Paris typically has more smog than other European, delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more passengers.

A lot of Americans are buying less cars, a study last year found out that driving by young people decresed 23 percent betweeen 2001-2009.

15b1360,"Can you imagine a time in the future when no one will have any money because of ""Driverless Cars"". Yes, you may think driverless cars is a good idea but its not. We already have ""Driverless Cars"", they are taxis and buses. They say it would use half the fuel of today's taxis and are more flexible than a bus. But how much would they cost? Are they going to be cheaper than a taxi? Are they going to be bigger than a bus?

Buses and taxis are probaly the cheapest forms of transport, and don't get me started on Ubers.

They say that Google has already made some ""Driverless Cars"", but they are not really driverless. Driverless means no one behind the wheel. ""They alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If it can't drive through traffic or back out of driveways then what's the point. What's the point of having a ""Driverless Car"" if it's not really driverless. Isn't the whole point of having a driverless car to relax and let it drive on it's own, not to be alerted when it can't even pull up into your driveway.

""Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads."" So what you're telling me is that you want to make the roads smarter too? No, you need to make humans smarter not cars or roads. If we weren't so lazy we wouldn't need ""Driverless Cars"". ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" Want if the ""human at the wheel"" sucks at driving?

Then we are going to have some issues.

The sensors are what the should be adding to cars. The sensors ""Can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better respone and control than a human driver could manage alone.""

See that is what we need in cars, they are so many car accidents because of speeding and drunk driving.

Ok back to why ""Driverless Cars"" souldn""t be made. Driverless cabs? They already driverless cabs, you, yourself are not driving the cab. Unless you are a cab driver you are not driving the cab, and it's going to take so many jobs away from cab drivers. ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to driver?"" Their turn to drive? So you take turns driving your brand new driverless car? But don't worry they have a in-car-entertaimnet and information system to make sure you don't fall asleep at the wheel. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"" I thought it was a driverless car why would the driver be at fault?

I can talk about this ""Driverless Cars"" idea for hours but I only have fifty-five minutes to talk about this. So i'm just going to wrap this up with my last thought. Driverless cars sould not be made.

Their are some benifits such as having a blimp-like vehicle hovering over the roiling venusian landscape for scientists to study venus.Like our airplane could fly over storms , a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly gound condition by staying up and out of their way.The hovering vehicle can avoid danger.Howerver looking at venus from above in a hovering vehicle can provide only limited insight on ground condition because most form of light can not penetrate the dense atmospher.There are many researchers who are working on innovating machines to last longer on the surface on venus to study it.Venus has value, not because of all the gains we get from it but also from our human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

1608b25,"The Face On Mars

Have you ever seen something crazy on something, maybe a face or something that you seen before? Have you thought about how that face or something else has gotten there? Well, for a start it defintley wasn't aliens! Just like the face on mars, people belive that the face was created by aliens! But that isn't true, the face on mars is just and only a natural landform that some how was created on earth.

For my first reason on why the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because NASA later revelied that the face was not made of aliens, but by shadows. A few days after that image was found, NASA needed to take a look and figure out what made this incredible and scientififc picture so unique, and why and how it was formed. Later on, they have came up with an good explaination about this unique image. NASA said this,""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Scientifically, the face was made from a natural cause, so it makes it a very different natural landform.

Now, for my second reason on why this was not made by aliens, but just a natural landform is that there is no scientific research showing that aliens do exist and created this face. Now I do know that some people say that they have seen aliens, but scientists dont think that is one hundred percent true because they don't have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real. Many people to belive in them, but how do we know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge? But now after NASA did some research, they found out that even though we don't have information about them, aliens did not create that face, it was only a natural landform.

For my third and final reason, why the face was not created by aliens and is only a natural landform , is because in the last paragraph,paragraph twelve, they talk about how the the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. Since the landform shows a butte or mesa, that means that the image was a major landform that came from the American West. Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He also said,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, this is not only a natural landform, but a major natural landform.

I do agree a little bit about aliens creating the face. Maybesomewhere in space, there are aliens that created something else or not. One day maybe we can find something out in space that has something to do with aliens, but today is just isn't the day to do that. But overall, i would have to agree that aliens did not create this, but this is only a natural landform created by something other than aliens.

As you can see, this creative landform was most defintley not created from aliens, but just a nice natural landform. Scientists now figured out that this ""Face on Mars"" is from shadows and not from aliens. This landform is actually a butte or a mesa which is very intersting to have found out. Many people did belive that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, but scientists haven't found out if there are aliens or not, so we shouldn't jump into conclusion. But overall, this face was defintely a landform and not created by aliens!!",5,3.0,,": The essay develops a clear point of view that the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform and not created by aliens.

16395a4,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has 44 major muscles in the human face programmed and their movements detectable by its software. While some may not understandable the use of this technology, it would be groundbreaking and highly effective within our classrooms. Many humans portray false or pretend emotions to other humans for various, different reasonings. However, the FACS could be used to break through this method of manipulation and deception by tracking the facial muscles being used and moved by its subject. It would allow the computer to calculate the different emotions and feelings being present in its subject, which could be used in a matter of many different ways.

Within the classroom, various emotions can be felt by its students while learning new topics and receiving their education. Feelings can range from excitement and an interest in learning new subjects to being bored or unmotivated to proceed with the lesson. Day by day, technology is further and used more frequently within our schools, allowing us to adapt new education methods. Most students in the US are presented with an electronic device by their school to complete their homework and classwork on. The FACS could easily be intregrated into these devices, affecting how education could be taught and learned. If it was being used in a correct, effective manner, it could change how we teach our students forever!

Let's imagine that a student was perhaps puzzled and confused by a lesson being taught using technology. The FACS program could detect this, modifying the information to be more understandable and/or enjoyable to the student. This would allow for education to be more effective in many different ways. It could be very different for how two tenth graders in the same class learn new subjects and topics the most effectively. If this was released into schools, it is very possible and most likely that grades would improve drastically. This technology could also assist those with special needs or learning disabilities to teach them in the most effective, best technique for them.

While being present at school, not all emotions displayed by students are caused by learning. There might be unknown stresses or difficulties at home or personal lives, causing emotional and/or physical distress. This can majorly affect their grades and learning experience, but also their overall health in general. Using the FACS to detect certain emotions and patterns in students could help notify educators and administration of possible issues with various causes. This would allow the student to gain access to the aid and assist they need to be able to persevere and stride forward with success. The health of students need to come first before learning and using technology to discover if they need assistance would invaluable to the school systems.

Technology is always advancing and evolving into different, new forms. The FACS is just one of the many things that could change our education system and how we teach students. Overall, it would provide aid to students that need it to succeed in their education and have more of a understanding in subjects they were originally confused by. A major benefit to using this program would be detecting distress in students, allowing the school to assist them and receive the help they need to succeed. The FACS could change how schools work forever if they were used in our classrooms and it would be for the benefit of our students.",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the use of FACS in classrooms and provides adequate examples and evidence to support its position.

165914d,"Venus is a interesting but amazing planet. It has a nickname of the ""Evening Star"". It is the planet that is the closest related to earth, which makes sense for it also being referred to as Earth's ""twin."" It being so closely related to our home planet has caught the eye of some. It is a planet no one can get close to however some think it is worth some risks to discover what lies there. You may be thinking what risks are there? Well there are quite a few. The author does a great job explaining what the risks are and how harsh Venus can be. However I do not believe they explained enough of the benefits that support why we should explore it despite the risk factor involved.

For Venus being Earth's ""twin"" it's very different from earth. The author included the facts of the atmosphere of Venus is made up of almost ninty-seven percent of carbon dioxide and it's clouds have highly corrosive sulferic acid in them. Earth does not have either of those and humans breathe oxygen and in return produces carbon dioxide. Humans really couldn't benefit from the lack of oxygen compared to the almost ninty-seven percent carbon dioxide. The almost other three percent may not even be oxygen but the author doesn't include that detail. Earth doesn't have an average of over 800 degress on its surface unlike Venus. The author then included that the pressure is 90 times greater on Venus then it is on Earth, that pressure can crush a submarine.

There is even more that prevent us from discovering more on Venus. The weather there can and will include erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning storms. Which is really not ideal at all for trying to explore.

NASA is working on ways to get up close with Venus. According to the passage they have been testing different electronics made of silicon carbide in chambers simulating the conditions on Venus. They discovered it could last up to three wees. Their other idea was to have scientists float above the fray. But they couldn't take rocks samples or anything by doing so. It would be a good way, but they really couldn't get the research they wanted. As well as the fact it wouldn't be easy conditions because of the radiation.

According to the author, Astromers are very interested in Venus because at one point they believe it was ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" They believe it was covered with oceans and even sustained life just like Earth does now. In current day they know that it still does have similarities to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. But is that really all worth it?

The author then says the value of returning there is indisputable. The author really included a lot more risks than benefits of returning there. The support they gave wasn't that supportive. Then would say something beneficial for example, they could actually observe from the fray but they only have limited sight of the planet. It really just adds to the negative part of the exploration. The article seemed to have more negativity than positivity. The risks drowned out the support which in turn made the author's point not as strong.             ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue of whether or not to explore Venus despite the risks involved.

16ed2eb,"There are many resons that people should do that. #1 is that it it would be some much fun to go explor places that you havent been befor, and go see all the unic culters that many people dont ever get to see in their life. #2 is that you could get closer with some of yor friends and family if they go with you, or invite you to go with them. Reson #3 is that you could meet new people learn other languiges too. Also you cold become part of a family they could take you in and youk cold have another really close friend from some were far far away from were you live.

In the story Luke said""It would a chance of a life time."" An I think it would be a chance of a life time. In my opinone I would do it. I would love to go on a trip tio eventure around the world. I love learning new cultres and to see what what it could help me with in my life. Also that it would be cool to do a report on all the places that you whent to in the proses. If I were him or any one els that got the opertunity I would say yes to doing it.

In my family its important to learn and get youst to doing thatbecause my famoly dose alot of edventering. We go to the D.R, Hawaii Colorado, and alot more places too. I think that any kid that gets invited should that, because what they learn stiks to them and it stays with them for a long time and if they dont then they missed a big opertoonity to do that.

I went to the DR for the first time when is like 5 years old and I learnd a lot of spanish when i as there. I also made a lot new friend people my age people that older younger than me too. An we bonded rely whell and i didnt know how to speek a word of spanish!!! I had a translator that helped me know what they were saying tio me and for them to tell the kids what i was saying too. i leand a lot of spanish when i wa there and i still know to say a lot of things in spanish too. I still kow my beat friens name in the D.R. We taught eachother how t say the alfabet in English and Spanish.

Just saying I had the best time of my life and I stayed in the same place the hole time and I still lernd a lot in one day.

And the hole time I was there I was so happy till it came to the part when I had to say by to all my new good friend that I made there. Its hard to leave but then you get to all the other places and meet other people there too.

People that want to explor should do this in order to see what ist like and if thay want to do this for the a long time or not. Just one time at a different place then were you live is awesome because you never want to leave. You could also go see uther animal sthat you have never seen befor in a zoo or that you have never herd of too. I love to see knew thing even if I have heard of it,or not, or seen it, or not it is still really cool to experiance that. An I think kids, aldolts, teens, or eve the elderl would stil love to see that or experiance that time with the family.

And that is my reso to do tha or a least tr yit out for the first time.

175775c,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author argues the point that exploring Venus is worth the effort and risks exhibited. The author claims that, despite the harsh conditions and deadly atmosphere, this planet is worth travelling to and observing, due to its being the ""nearest option for a planetary visit"". While the author does list a few good reasons for Venus exploration, it is my belief that they also include many reasons not to explore this dangerous planet. This inclusion of the ""cons"" of exploration hurts the thesis more than it helps it, and damages the authors argument.

From the beginning of their argument, the author states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing [on Venus] for more than a few hours"" and that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"". The usage of these statements creates a negative image, which can lead readers to believe that the exploration of Venus is too dangerous to enagage in. Furthermore, the author uses facts intended to continue to convince readers that Venus is dangerous, when this is exactly the opposite of what the author is arguing for. Making statements which invoke fear or apprehension only pushes the reader away from the topic, instead of influencing him or her to gain interest in it. For instance, when the author uses phrases with negative connotations, such as ""thick atmosphere"", ""corosive sulfuric acid"", ""800 degrees Fahrenheit"", and ""extreme"", they influence readers negatively as well.

Similarly, the author provides little reasoning behind the belief that humanity should explore the planet Venus. Despite claiming that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"", there is little evidence given that exploring and observing Venus would be of much benefit. In fact, the author seems to have found more evidence against Venus exploration, as the prior paragraph (which listed reasons that Venus was dangerous) was much more explicit and detailed than paragraph 3. The negatives of exploring Venus (such as death and wasted money or time) seem to far outweigh the positives.

As the author continues with their argument, readers become increasingly aware that Venus is likely not as beneficial as the author intends to make it seem. With an unlivable biome and dangerous atmospheric conditions, Venus is likely far too hazardous to explore at this time in history, and I believe that the author of this article unwittingly proved so. For these reasons, I believe that the author of this article failed to support their thesis with thorough evidence or detail.

178f445,"In the 21st century there has

been a lot of new technology invented. Driverless cars is among the many invention ideas that is still on the drawing board. Driverless cars should not be developed because it will cost a lot of money, traffic laws will have to be modified, and the cars won't be truely driverless.

The amount of money it will cost to make a mass oroduction of driverless cars is not worth it. The passage says ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sennsors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor."" All of the items that the Toyota Prius has on it will be needed for the new driverless cars. The things mentioned in the quote do not include the many internal modifications that will need to be made. The car companies that create cars will need to pay to have thier workers trained to be able to do the modificatins that the driverless car needs. The car company will also have to pay for all of the expensive sensors that are needed. This wil drive up the over all cost of the smart car, and make it too expensive for the average working person.

The driving laws that exist as of today focus on keeping all citizens safe, and lawmakers assume that the onlt safe cars have an alert human driver. The passage says ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safecar has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" In the US the laws state that it is illegal in many states . The laws in those states would have to be changed to allow driverless cars to enter into that state. The traffic laws that those states have were created to try and keep all members of society safe. The assumption of the states with these laws are that the only safe car is a car being driven by an alert human. Sincethis is that case the laws that were created most likely would not be changed to allow driverless cars to drive on the roads of those states.

The cars would not be able to be completly driverless. The passage says ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The cars that have been invented and tested so far are unable to be completly driverless. The cars lack skills that only humans are able to accomplish. These skills include navigating through work zones and accidents, which are two very common things on today's roads.

Since the cars are not completly driverless a human driver will have to be alert at all times in case the car isn't able to preform a human driving skill that is needed.

The overall cost, law changes, and driving assistance that will be needed to operate a driverless car is not worth it. Those factors will not change in a few years, so car companies should not waste their time and resources trying to develop a driverless vehical.

1ac7f5b,"In Nick D'Alto's article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, the value for technology is absurd, because in certain situations everyone should not be exposed to the emotions of others. For example, emotions are extremely personal and sometimes it is not technically appropriate to showcase every emotion you are feeling. A student or teacher could be going through something personal, that needs to be left out of the workplace and school. Success at school or work in general depends on how you engage in those specific tasks at hand, so the emotions the computer is claiming you are having should not interfere with specific things outside of your personal life. Detecting emotions should be left out of serious, and professional environments such as work or school. Lastly, the computer is only trained to detect the movement of the muscles in your face. But your face may not always match the feeling of emotion inside, so this may not be the most appropriate device to truly rely on.

The importance of keeping emotions personal, and not oversharing with people around you is extremely important. Most students are usually adolescents and they sometimes have a hard time expressing and controlling their emotions. So having a device eager to showcase their feelings can be dangerous and insensitive. Eckman has already begun to classify specific emotions including; ""anger, fear, disgust, and sadness,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 3). The negative emotions should not be shared! A computer should not illustrate how you are feeling on the inside to others. This can awaken a lot of frustrated, and haphazard behavior among teens if something is constantly around proclaimming it understands how everyone is feeling. D'Alto also states, ""associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" (Paragraph 3). The muscles in the face should not be studied by a computer, and they should not be able to invade the privacy of the muscle movement in someones face. Also, some may argue that their face does not always match what they are feeling, so that leaves alot of room for confusion, and flaws on the systems part. It's untraditional, and orthodox, and an invasion of mental privacy.

Everyone is different, whether life is amazing or terrible, someone should not be able to be read or determine how you are feeling by what a computer says about their face. Some teachers or students could be dealing some serious, and personal things that should not find their way into the workplace or school. But, if this device is constantly procclaiming a student or teacher is sad or upset about something personal it is completely unneccessary. Students should not know the personal lives of their teachers or vise versa. This is an ambigous invasion of privacy, and could potentially even amount to a crime or disservice to some people. D'Alto questions the reader, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" (D'Alto, Paragraph 6). This only has limited benefits and could cause immense problems in relation to others knowing personal things relating to your emotions. The specific boundaries it crosses especially if you are not well acquainted with the people constantly around you is alarming. D'Alto claims again, ""Can your lab partner recognize which one?"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 7). There should be absolutely no valid reason, why someone you may not know should be able to, and have the capacity to read your emotions from looking at you. In schools, sometimes in relation to this specific example, students are not acquainted with their lab partners or the people around them. So this would be like giving a stranger a clear look, and picture into another persons mind! It would be like being allowed to read the mind of others around you. This specific example is horrible in attempt to promote their product, and scares the consumers with the thought of others starring into their souls.

Technology has never been a reliable thing, it has never lived up to its name and full potential when people truly want it to. The thought of a computer having this amount of control is excessive, and unrealistic. In Paragraph 7, D'Alto states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 7). If our PC's cannot handle the Mona Lisa, how will they have the capacity to decode our real life, actively changing faces? Can the creators of this system not see their flaws? D'Alto continues to suggest, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code."" (D'Alto, Paragraph 5). This passage is inferring to the reader that the only logical way a computer can read information is through and electrical code. Humans do not produce emotions through an electrical code, so it is not logical to expect their emotions to be read to through an emotional code.

All in all, the idea was ambitious, but it defintely was not original or rationally thought out. The thought of a computer reading into personal emotions, attempting to decode issues that are too personal to be brought into school and work, and essentially incorrectly interpret emotions is absurd. This whole idea invades the privacy of the people in society, and is a very touchy subject that should not be programmed into a computer.

1b45c61,"Our facial expressions can tell someone a lot about how we feel about something or situations in our lives, sometimes even better than verbal communication. Being able to read these expressions and change the environment around us could help the human race acheive the goal of becoming monumentally more happy people. Throughout the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author mentions many studies and facts relating to the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions. This would be very useful in the classroom because the studies shown have very intelligent figures present, the article includes a thourough explanation about how the FACS operates and succeeds, and how the technology could improve the willingness to learn and the ultimate goal of maintaining happiness.

First of all, in paragraph 6, the diction in the paragraph and the implementation of an interview with an intelligent figure relating to the product prove that this machine could make a vital difference in a classroom-style learning environment. For exmaple, author Nick D'Alto interviews Dr. and Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang works with other professors such as Nicu Sebe on the FACS, and in this pragraph he states many important facts about how computers could alter the learning environment based on how the student feels. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

Being able to modify a lesson for a single student rather than an entire group could make a huge difference. Rather than the teacher having to chage the whole lesson for the entire class, the computer could ""read"" and individual student's face and effectively personalize the lesson for that student alone. This technology could supply a much needed change to the sometimes ineffective teaching of an instructor.

Also, in paragraphs 7 and 8, detailed instructions are given on how the machine works and how it can detect fake emotions from real emotions. For example, at the end of paragraph 7, the author states the difference between the muscle movements in a real and fake smile. He then states how the machine looks for the muscle movements and formations of a real smile rather than those of a fake one. Also, in paragraph 8, even more examples of differences in muscle formation are used to show how the technology will in fact work in a classroom environment. The differences between a fake and real smile may seem like an easy task to distinguish in real life, and it may appear to be a problem for a machine. However, the information written by D'Alto from the interview with Dr. Huang show that the machine will have no problem distinguishing a real, genuine happy smile from a fake, intentionally deceiving grin. Therefore, a student could not effectively trick the machine into changing a lesson in a classroom environment.

Finally, in paragraph 9, a study on facial expressions and their relation to emotions is cited. In this study, many important ideas about feelings carried out by humans are stated with truthfulness and security. For example, the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion states that moving your facial muscles can not only express emotions, but can even help produce them. This states that real emotions can occur from just making a face. Even if the person who was making the expression originally was not feeling that emotion, they may in fact feel that way after one small change in their expression. Also, the author references a ""renowed drama coach,"" Constantin Stanislavsky, who states that he forced his actors to reproduce the actions of smiling and frowning so they genuinely feel happy or sad when on stage. Overall, a change in one small part of your face can change how you feel, and if this technology is implemented into classrooms throughout America, that one small change could alter the way students feel about learning.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as mentioned in Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" could be used in classrooms to successfully ""read"" the faces of students, alter the lesson in some way just for them, and make sure each student is happy with what they are hearing and seeing. If this technology is implemented into classrooms around the globe, students will be more excited about their learning experiences, possibly receive much improved grades, and be more happy people in gerenal. If the faces of the next generation are happier than ever, what's to come afterword could be even better.",6,4.0,,": The essay effectively develops a point of view on the use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in classrooms.

1cbab90,"The author's claim in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is not well supported by the evidence provided, and the reasoning behind the evidence. The author claims that the planet Venus would be a worthy goal to pursue, despite the dangerous conditions and harmful atmosphere that the planet posseses. The author provides information on possible ways that we could overcome the challenge of landing on the planet Venus, but no clear reason as to why we should pursue this goal besides his own rationalization of a reason provided at the end of the article. Not only is the evidence that the author provides theoretical in the efficiency of the tools stated on another planet, but the purpose of the tools in collecting samples and taking photos is not descibed or elaborated on. Despite the risks, the author has no clear reason for the benefit of landing on Venus, and the tools that the author proposes do not support the idea that it would be possible to land on Venus and actively collect samples or take pictures.

The author claims that the value of returning to Venus ""seems indisputible"" in paragraph 4, but the only reason for this claim is his analogy that Venus is similar in structure to Earth. In paragraph 5, the author states that a possible way to approach the planet seems possible, because NASA had an idea to create ""a blimp-like vehicle to hover over Venus."" The author in paragraph 6 states that the blimp would only allow us to recieve ""limited insight"" on the planet, and we would not be able to take samples or take pictures due to the dense atmosphere. The author does not provide any possible way to collect samples and overcome this issue, besides stating how ""many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This statment provides no actual evidence as to any progress researchers have made, or if anything useful will come from the knowledge of the surafce Venus.

In paragraph 7, the author mentions a technology made of ""silicon carbide"" that has been tested by NASA, and survived a simulation of the conditions of Venus for three weeks. The author does not elaborate on the uses for these strong electronics, and leaves the reader guessing at the purpose of this technology. The author also mentions the use of mechanical computers used in the 1940s during World War II. The author speaks of how these computers make calculations by using gears and levers, but does not elaborate on anything else besides their increased resistance to ""pressure, heat, and other forces."" Once again the author provides no clear reason to the purpose behind the inventions, besides the possible survival of the technology on Venus.

Finally, the author presents his own opinion in paragraph 8. The author states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planent itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Paragraph 8, as the author has wrote, is entirely opinionated and dangerously optimistic. His reasoning behind the value of ""meeting the challenge of Venus"" is the equivalent to practice for humanity, because ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally indimidating endeavors."" The authors opinion of the research on Venus, as shown by this statment, seems to be entirely based on the idea that we should practice for future endeavors despite the dangers which is not only naiive, but dangerous.

To summarize all of this information, the author shows no clear reason as to why we should risk the resources and manpower to attempt an expedition on Venus. The author provides no purpose for the tools stated besides their increased survivability rate, and the author's opinion is forced onto the reader by stating in paragraph 8 that we should ignore the dangers and doubts of exploration to meet the limits of innovation. The author poorly supports his claim of ""a worthy pursuit despite the dangers"" and provides no facts or evidence for the benefits of humanity attempting the challenge of Venus.

223b86d,"The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life. However NASA has provided evidence that proves the face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. Through advancements in digital imagery, an understanding of shadows, and an understanding that there is no alien life evidence, it can be concluded that the face on mars is just a myth.

Today, we humans have the access to cameras with spectacular resolution. When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.

Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This excerpt from the article explains that the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows.

While many conspiracy theorists would still like to believe that aliens created this face on the moon, they are mistaken. With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found. However, others still argue.

Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct. However, NASA has nothing to gain from hiding information from the world. If anything, NASA would want the world to know about ancient aliens building landforms. The article mentions, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars."" This statement proves that NASA has no reason to hide information.

So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.

394b71b,"Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.

Strangley, the author of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars""

suggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was ""a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,"" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.

Ultimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?

All in all, there is no ""true"" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature. There is no recorded history of the face moving. Also, what ""face"" is the size of man made Mt. Rushmore? In the text, the author states, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" The author is trying to explain that technology has grown with the landmark, and a sharper picture actually reveals an alike picture of the landform that had no sign of any life. The author explained in the text that the high resultion camera was so strong that pyramids, airplanes on the ground, or even the small shacks that you see when you drive down the interstate were crystal clear. This means that the Face had to have been landforms that one person might have mistaken for life on another planet.

On the other hand, some may also say that they is no proof. The Face could just as well be life on another planet, but there is no true evidence to prove so. In fact, scientist have came up with more ways that the Face is not life rather than if it was.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.""

43d5bb4,"Computers are one of the best inventions ever made by humans because they have enabled everybody around the world to connect to the Internet. The Internet fuels most peoples lives because of the sheer amount of accessible information about anything and everything. However, should we let computers start making their own decisions? Thomas Huang is the creator of a computer software that allows computesr to read human emotions using 3-D modeling and analyzing muscle movements in the face. At first glance, this appears to be an interesting concept, but there could be several downsides to this type of invention such as overall practicality, implementation in today's society, and even safety and security issues.

First of all, is a software that can read our emotions actually useful? There is potential for this type of software to be used on people for occasions such as a interrogation where the suspect could be lying and the software could detect a quivering lip. On the other hand, this type of software is most likely not going to make it into the homes of the people which presents a business problem. Their solution is to introduce the software into schools to be used for enhancing the learning experience. Dr Huang describes how computers in the classroom could ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"" resulting in a better learning environment for the student. The issue is, not every student needs this, and many will prbably disagree with having this software implemented in their school. So, this type of computer software has few areas that it will probably be used causing it to be less practical than it originally seems.

Secondly, how will FACS (Facial Action Coding System) be implemented into a society that is normally unwilling to new changes regarding their technology? People want improvements, but they don't want change. For example, when an application has an update most people update it without giving it a second thought because the newer it is the more likely it will be ""better"" than the previous version. But, when a new phone comes out with plenty of changes people are skeptical and wait for their friend to buy it before they consider purchasing one themselves. So, as a result, people will most likely be skeptical of a software that is able to read emotions because it is something new and no one has any experiences with it yet. This causes FACS to seem like a software that won't be implemented or at least widespread for a long time.

Lastly, will the common person feel like their privacy is being invaded with this new software? For FACS to work the user must have a camera or some kind of scanning device that is able to detect individual muscles. A highly accurate scanning device in the common home will most definitely scare some people out of having this type of software. For example, some people believe that they are already watched through their smartphone camera even though they don't have any form of evidence of such actions taking place. A natural fear of invasion of privacy is part of human nature and cannot be changed. In paragrpah seven D'Alto, the author, mentions that FACS can detect a fake and a real smile which only solidifies the softwares scanning precision. What if someone was talking with their boss using their computer and they lied to protect their job? Although this kind of action should result in that person being punished or fired FACS could use the camera on the computer to see that they were lying and report it to the person's boss or company. Now, this situation is impractical and hopefully it never happens, but the idea that FACS has the ability to use a camera in the home to do whatever they want is scary and will drive people away from using it.

In conclusion, FACS will probably be used for specific tasks only, but it is interesting to ponder the potential for similar softwares in the future. The main problem that Dr. Huang will face is trying to show the people the trustworthiness of the product. If there is too much skepticism from the people it simply won't be found around the world and rather only in more secluded places such as labs or research facilities for testing purposes. In the future, other softwares will be created and maybe they will have the potential to impact the world in influential, innovative, and successful ways.

44bca10,"The face on Mars really is just a landform. I've seen the landform before on our very own home planet. My family and I were going to Grand Canyon for a vacation. Life had been rough so we decided we deserved to see the country a little bit. Upon arriving in Arizona, I saw hundreds of mesas, which are landforms that look like faces. I was petrified at first, until I learned they were merely landforms. The first time I saw the alledged ""Face on Mars,"" I knew it was merely a landform. I believe the Face is a landform and not an alien figure because it was exaggerated by Hollywood and the media, it would be better for NASA if it were an alien life form, and there are already lots of similar landforms on Earth.

Hollywood, its the home of the media. Of course the media will do anything for views. As soon as they found out about the Face, they jumped all over it. For instance, in paragraph 5, the author quotes, ""The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon."" This implies that it really wasn't a big deal before it started to become popularized. Paragraph 5 also shows us that it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in magazines, books, radio talk shows, and even was told in checkout lines for 25 years. The Face was an icon of its time, and thus was twisted to seem like an alien figure.

Moving on, why would NASA want to keep an alien a secret? If NASA actually did find an alien, they would want to let the world know so that they'd have more funding. In paragraph 5, we are told that the NASA budget wishes that there was an ancient civivlization of Mars. This proves that it would help NASA pay off debts and would make them more popular in the face of the public. It is also stated in paragraph 7 that Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, had a few words to say.

""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim said. This exemplifies that NASA knew it was only a landform, but they wanted to take pictures so that the public would pay them more.

A third reason for my believing is that there are already many landforms like this. The landform is called a mesa. As I said earlier, I've seen many of these landforms in Arizona. We are shown in paragraph 7 that when the picture of The face first appeared on a JPL web site, it showed that there was no alien monument, only a landform. This proves to us that sure, if you take a picture from a certain angle, it looks like a face; when you take it from a different angle, it looks like the landform that it is. This is similar to the Man on the Moon. We know that it is just a bunch of craters, making it look like a human figure. In the final section, 12, Garvin states a perfect example.

""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is an excerpt from the passage that demonstrates how the Face is no different from our landforms on Earth.

Some might say that the face is actually an alien monument, and that NASA just doesn't want the public to know. But, what they don't realize is that NASA would benefit from seeing an alien life form. The public would love it, and the money would start rolling in. The author tells us that defenders of the NASA budget actually wish that there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars.

It seems that life gets so boring for people that they make any little thing seem amazing. This is shown through the fact that people made a landform appear as an alien monument. Through all the incomplete theories, I still believe that the Face is purely a landmark. I believe this because hollywood and the media exaggerated it greatly, the discovery of alien life would actually benefit NASA, and there are many landmarks on Earth and Mars that represent the supposed ""Face of Mars.""",6,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

4649f4f,"As technology advances in a very constant and remarkable fasion, many new innovations begin to reveal themselves. While we still might be waiting for the next flying car or teleporter, several smaller, yet very significant, inventions have presented themselves. An example of this is a computer software that is able to identify and recognize emotions. Profesor Thomas Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the Univeristy of Illinois created this software in hopes of changing the world for the better, but is it really that great? Among the several other practical uses, Huang says that the use of this technology in the classroom can be the most important. Overall the use of emotional recognition has the potential to be useful due to the ability to change the lesson based on mood, and alter mood based on the current your current status, but overall would not be 100% effective due to the spiratic qualities of humans.

Dr. Huang, the inventor of the emotional recognition, claims there could be huge advancements in the education system due to his new technology. In a time of computer screens, video games, and the newest iphone students have trouble beign lectured for six hours a day. Dr. Huang's main goal is to put a computer with the lesson plans and his software in front of a computer so that it can do the teaching, effectivly. If a student begins to get bored and their zygomatic major muscles begin to relax and visibly show the boredom setting in, Dr Huang's computer software would be able to recognize and alter the lesson to be more engaging to the student. This would easily work for many other situations, if a student is sad the lesson could use brighter colors and better diction to create an enviorment where the student is not distracted and wants to learn. Nick D'Alto describes a situation where a student becomes very confused and does not know what they are doing and how to do it, but with the use of Dr Huang's technology the lesson could be changed and break down to easier steps to correctly compensate for the confusion.

Overall, the use of Dr. Huang's software to change a lesson would be very useful in improving the learning enviorment for the students who will go on to create equally as innovative new mechanism in the future.

Secondly, the software can be used to help change the mood of a student in order to boost morale as well as create an enviorment where the student wants to learn. In this day and age there are so many things for a student to be passionate about, such as: sports, video games, friends, and so much more. This is very good in the sense of passion but ultimately takes away from the desire to learn and become successful in school. Often times a student comes into school with the worst mood possible, hating every second of it, but Dr. Huang could change things up. For example if a student comes into school angry Dr. Huang's facial coding system would be able to create an enviorment where the lesson becomes more like a game for the student to play and enjoy while at the same time learning the content.

If a student comes into school depressed, it could be the job of the system to recognize this, notify someone, and help them be happy.

Dr. Huang's invention creates a short cut in seeing how someone feels through science. At times people are too afraid to ask ,""Are you okay?"". The use of this software can go straight to the aiding of someone without even having to think twice. In the end, emotions create roadblocks for students to learn and the use of Dr. Huang's technolgy can identify and help break them down so that a kid can be a normanl kid again.

Although Dr. Huang's software is extremly useful, things can often be a little more complicate than what technology can actually be good for. While the identifying of emotions is very useful, the actual action of neutralizing them can be beyond the machine. For example, if a student is crying their eyes out with no sign of stopping, I am pretty sure a change in the lesson will not help calm that student. If a student is so mad that they just want to break the computer and storm off, no change in the lessons music, colors, or diction is going to be able to fix that. In general an actual human is what each student needs to be there for them. The warmth of a hug or simple hand on the shoulder can change the outlook on a students entire emotional status. The fact that an actual teacher cares is more than enough to allow the teacher to keep teaching. Overall Dr. Huangs software is incredibly useful to identify emotional change but really can not help deal with most situations like a teacher would.

In conclusion Dr. Huang's software holds its value in it's ability to read emotions and alter the lesson as well as alter the mood of a student in need, but is very limited in how it can help a student get through their troubles. The use of Dr. Huang's technolgy in the classroom will definately lead to advances in student comprehension but for the many individuals that need more than a computer for sypathy, the program most likely will not work.

47d8c55,"The Electoral College is best described as outdated and obsolete. It was designed so that, when there were too many states and poor technology, the vote could be fairly and reallistically counted, by voting between a few people from each state. This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the all-or-nothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information.

When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccouted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notecard that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, reciept, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue ""Enter"" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we?

The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state. He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 7-11 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, ""That girl Suzie's"" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. But wait! there's more. Most states have an all-or-nothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair. It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 1700-1800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.

4b037f4,"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmoshere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town car-free. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completeley true since plug-in cars, hybrids, and other earth-friendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of foosil fuel-powered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual's decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come.    ",6,4.0,,":**

4b50f50,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, a new techonology known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) provides computers and devices to identify emotions in humans. The techonlogy does this through scanning facial muscle movements and with basic psychology knowldege. However, this new techonlogy is also being proposed to being used in schools to have more effective schooling based on the emotions of students. The using of FACS to determine the emotinos of students is valuable because it allows for more interactive lessons that are based off of non-verbal communication, which will help students succeed at a higher level.

With the inception of FACS, the interactions between humans and computers can become more efficient, and will allow for more streamlined communication. In the article, Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcluding emotional communication"" (6). If in a classroom situation, a computer trying to teach a lesson with students might not be able to understand if its pupils are getting the concepts, or it wouldn't be able to dectect whether the students are paying attention or being engaged. Since most human interactions are non-verbal, the computer would have a hard time communicating with the students to understand what was wrong. With FACS, however, the computer can analyze non-verbal cues and alter its teaching style. This in turn would allow the students to have a better time and have a higher understanding of the materials being learned.

Not only does the concept and development of FACS allow for more streamlined communcation between humans and computers in the classroom, it also removers barriers between humans and computers by allowing computers to act more like humans, creating a more effective learning environment. In the article, D'Alto states that like how FACS learns to interpret emotions based on non-verbal facial cues, ""we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day""(5). This means that by giving computers/teachers the ability to accuratley identify emotins (to some extent), we are lessening the difference between a physical and a digitial teacher by making the computer more ""human"". In an age where the world is becoming more and more digital, it is a neccesity that students and computers are able to communicate effectively. If Dr. Huang's quote ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'""(4), is true, this means that if a computer can analyze mixed human emotions in a classroom setting, it is possible that not only will the computer modify lesson plans to make teaching more interesting, it will also have an almost artificial empathy, allowing for students to be more accepting of a digitial counterpart.

In addition to streamlining communication and being more relatable to students, the usage of FACS system in a classroom computer can also be used to solve conflicts and make resolutions between students. In the article, D'Alto states that some facial muscle movements, showcase negative emotinos and false emotions as well. One of these muslces is the orbicularis oris, which tightens one's lips to show anger(3). Furthermore, certain muslce cues ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(8). Since FACS is able to analyze these kinds of movements as well, it can detect when two students are angry at one another, or when a student is lying or being subtly disrepctful. By being able to recognize these situations, the FACS system can advise teachers on how to solve these various conflicts or negative scenarios and can be of use to better the general nature of the classroom.

Overall, throughout Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is shown that by using the technology known as FACS, communcation between humans and computers can be streamlined. When placed in a school, FACS is valuble because it modify lessons to make teaching more effective, be more relatable and approachable to students, and can resolve conflicts in a classroom. In the future, with more and more systems such as FACS being implemented, it is possible that soon computers will devlop emotions of their own!

5091e12,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about a great number problems that come along with trying to get information on the our planetary neighbor, Venus. We, the readers, learn in detail about the specific challenges that come along with studying Venus, even with its close proximity to us. Despite the author describing all of the struggles that come along with studying our sister planet, the passage still supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwile pursuit, through giving us strong examples of useful information we could learn, and describing safer and easier ways that we could study it that would make it far more simple to get the desired data.

While there are certainly many difficulties that the passage describes about getting information from Venus, the author thoroughly explains all of the great scientific benefits that we could get out of a Venus mission. As the author describes in paragraph four, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Not only will information about Venus teach us more about the universe around us, it might just be useful in order to study our own planet. Being able to learn so much from what a previous Earth could have been like would be a massive benefit to fields like history, and the earth sciences. The author goes into even more detail about this just afterward, describing how ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only are they similar from a geological perspective, it could provide vital information to the studies of biology, and possibly even support details about where we came from to begin with. There are hundreds, if not thousands of scientists specifically studying the cosmos trying to find planets with water that even have a small chance of supporting any form of life. The potential for further discovery here only a short distance away is extrodinary, and the author wisely emphasizes this through the passage.

Not only is the possibility for fascinating exploration and gaining crucial information about the Earth from Venus supported, the author also makes the important point that we are coming closer and closer by the day to this becoming a reality. In the seventh paragraph the author discusses this idea. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" When they put some of the brightest engineers in the world to a specific task of making electronics that could survive in Venus, the results were successful, as they made them able to survive for almost a month. While a month doesn't sound like a long time for the equipment to last, the author mentions later on in the passage that ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme phyisical conditions."" The most delicate part any device that would land on Venus would be the electronics inside any rover or measuring equipment. The great advances in the durability of these electronics points toward an optimistic future in devices designed for Venus, as we are already seeing incredible progess being made. However, what would happen if they couldn't find a way around the delicacy of modern computers? The author proves that wouldn't be the end of our Venus hopes, that mechanical computers can be utilized in order to avoid easily broken hardware. Even in the worst case scenerio, our scientists are still devising ways to land a probe on Venus.

Though the author presents some great challenges in getting samples and other data from Venus, he strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through the development of new and better ways to survive the harsh atmosphere, and information that could be gained from it that is useful to studying scientific and historical fields back here on Earth that he mentions in the passage. The human race, throughout history, has always remained curious and are willing to sacrifice and go through long periods of experimentation to acheieve knowledge. We have faced these struggles as humans before, and this will not be the struggle that stops us.

1911daf,"Cars have always been apart of American culture. From the ""...birth place of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""'Mustang Sally'""(The End of Car Culture, Rosenthal) Cars and automobils have impacted our everyday lifes from going to the store to hanging out with friends, but car usage has been stedily decreesing and for all the right reasons.

A new movemnent is trending everywhere, it's called ""smart planning"". It's simple, separate subarban life from auto use. In doing so this movement is going to help out the econdomy and also the enviorment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 perecent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" [empheses on original] That many emissions are horrible for the enviorment and even worse for our pockets, because they're just going up in smoke. New cities are rising and are acctuly trying to adopt this trend by making cities denser, which means that all the stores and your work place are in walking distance. By being able to walk to your local shopping store or favorite move theatre means that you're saving gas, and by saving gas the ecodimey is saving money which will make prices in all the stores and other bussnesses cheaper for the consumer, you!

The infamous smog is not only in Bejing, or the United States, but also in The City of Love. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London..."" (Paragraph 17, Duffer) The city is not so lovely as you'd think it would be, but the trend has cought on in Paris! Not only that but it also has been great for the enviorment. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Begjing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" (Paragraph 14, Duffer)

Most people would think ""I could never do that! No one could live like that and still make a living!"" Honestly though, it's been doing the city of Bogota in Colombia, a city comprimised of 7 million citizens a favor. They held a event for only one day evey year since the mid 1990s to improve and ""...promote alternive transportation and reduce smog."" (Paragraph 21, Selsky) Doing this has sparked a revolution of change thoughout the whole city. More people are willing to walk insted of drive to help the enviorment and the place they live in, and the city is giving right back to them! ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut trafic; and new restaruants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Paragraph 28, Selsky) Just one day a week could cut down smog and other green house gasses a lot and help our enviroment and the edodomey.

Back in the 1950's people had to use cars to do eveything. From talking to a friend face to face to going to the nearest resturant. But now you can do all of that in your own living room, due to technology that has advanced us to be able to use Facetime, Skype, or Oovoo to talk to our friends face to face using out phone, tablet, or personal computer. And to drive anywhere we need to we have apps the diliver taxies to our houses for us.""...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends...Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps have facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared can services fro getting to work."" ( Paragraph 35, Rosenthal)

Working everyday will effect this because no one wants to miss work. Missing work means less money and creates more stress for the person missing work. By saving maybe $10 on gas that day you're missing out on the $125 you could've made by working, but there's another solution to this also. Car-pool! Even if you're driving the car yourself or you're in the car you're saving fule and money. Once a week you could to this to stop in increes of smog in our enviorment and even help with traffic jams. And without traffic jams eveyone is less stressed out and a lot more happier.

By not using our cars as much, we can help ourselves and everyone aroud us by making a better world that makes it better for our children, or even our childrens' children. We can save money by just taking one day off of not driving. We should limit car use so we can stop car accedents from happening, getting stressed in traffic jams, to helping out the economical heart of the United States, and just to make our world a better place to have fun and thrive in.

191623d,"Dear, State Senator

I have recently read articles about the electoral vote system currently in place in the united states.

The electoral vote system elects other people, called electors, to vote for the people.  They basically vote for president, if you and many others vote for him/her.  I believe the electoral vote system is glitchy, outdated, and confusing to some.

The electoral vote system can be manipulated and unfair.  The electors can be choosen by state conventions, state central committees, and the candidates running for president.  If the president can choose his electors, could'nt he replace the orignal electors for new ones that will guarantee a vote for him.  The peoples vote would'nt matter.  This situation happened in the two-thousand election when George W. Bush won the election with more indivisual votes than electoral votes.  This violates our constitution which states, the government is controlled by the people and allows for change if enough people in the US want it.  If you've ever noticed that during the presidential election, candidates don't come to certain states.  In the electoral system, each state has a winner-take-all system.  When the state goes over their electoral votes, the winner with the most electoral votes takes all of them, while the electoral votes of the opponent gets no votes toward him.  This can cause mayhem, the non-counted votes can make a big diffrence in the election.  In nineteen-seventy six their would have been a tie if 9,246 voters in Hawaii and Ohio voted the opposing side.  The elections come close and without the popular vote which accounts for millions of people in America, we may have had better elections with less debates.  The electoral college contains 538 electors, out of those 538 their only 270 are mandatory to vote.  Each elector equals each member in your states House Of Represenatives and add two for the senate.  California has a population of 35 million and wyoming has a population of 500,000.  Wyoming having 5 electors and california having 55.  This doese'nt make sense because if a state may have a higher population than wyoming but yet still have less electors.  The system is very confusing in these ways causing some to vote for the wrong candidate and others thinking they are voting for the right candidate they believe is true .

The electoral votes are'nt the worst because we are still showing our democracy, showing off Americas greatnest in its government.  The electoral vote crisis in two-thousand rarely happens.  This situation has'nt happened since eightteen-eighty eight, its a rare occurance.  Electoral votes also make the playing field even.  If we had popular votes in place, then wouldnt the presidents have a landslide if they went to all the biggest populated states.  The electoral votes can allow ties and close elections to happen instead of land slides in many elections.

The electoral votes should be replaced.  Even so they even out the playing field and the occurence of rigged electoral votes happen, it still doese'nt make up for the both elections lost in eightteen-eighty eight and two thousand.  If we dont change the electoral votes soon, the occurance of electoral vote sabotage will occur more often causing an unfair government to be in place.            ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that the electoral vote system is flawed and should be replaced.

1af5f9b,"For decades humans have been fascinated by the idea of cars that do not require any human assisstance to drive. In recent years, this Science- Fiction movie staple has become les of a dream and more of a reality. Many companies are producing and testing drivelerless cars, but are they really safe? Driverless cars are unsafe because they require human attention, and because technology is unreliable. They are also impractical, and therefore, will never become a household staple.

The term ""driverless""

is not really the best word to describe these cars, because they do require an alert human driver, with their eyes on the road, and may even require the human driver to take over in certain situations, such as backing out of a driveway, or thorugh a contruction zone. This begs the question,"" What is the point?"" Why would we go through the trouble of creating these self-driving cars, if they are not completely self- driving? The truth is that no technology can replace human insticts in situations such as road-construction or traffic jams. However, if people are able to drive these cars, many wil most likely not pay attention to their surroundings. To solve this issue, many companies have invented creative ways to get the driver's attention when they need to take over. However, the only way for these cars to be completely safe is for the driver to remain alert and watching the road at all times. If a driver is already watching the road, they may as well just drive themselves!

In addition to this, there is the issue of whether these cars can truly be trusted. There are many issues with technology in our day to day lives. If a person's TV or cell phone stops working while they are using it, it is not a disasterous issue, but if their car stops accelerating and steering in the middle of the road, there may be monumental consequences! Technology can never be relied on completely, because there will always be issues and problems that may arise. Simply put, there is a reason that these cars are outlawed in almost every state!

Safety issues aside, there is also a practicality issue with these cars. Is this really something that people will use in their everyday lives? Will these cars be a practical item for common people? As discussed earlier, the driver has to keep constant attention on the road for these cars to be safe. These cars simply are not practical. For example, the BMW ""Traffic Jam Assisstant"" can only reach speeds of 25 miles per hour, and requires the driver to keep hold of the wheel. These cars also use a lot of sensors. Would they be practical and effecient to manufacture? Chances are, many people would not even be able to afford these vehicles, becuase the prices would be astonomical. These cars are not practical for everyday use by the average person. They are more fitting as a toy for a celebrity or millionaire. The self-driving car will not become a household staple for the everyday family.

Self-driving cars shoud not continue to be developed. These vehicles are unsafe and impractical. They require constant human attention and the liability issues are muddy, at best. For these reasons, self-driving cars should not continue to be developed, and will never become a common item in the United States.

1b14997,"In this reading, the author is talking about exploring venus, but all his evidence speaks differently. I believe the author does not support the clam that Venus is a worthy pursuit because the evidence given is mediocre. He contradicts himself in many paragraphs proving why we shouldn't send people over, and has not given any reason why we should go over there.

In this short persuasive article, the author does not pursuade at all. In paragraph two, the backround of Venus is given, but it's not stated why its important to visit this planet. ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" The only valid reason givin in this short story is when it is said in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This statement gives no reason for traveling and researching Venus except for the fact it used to be like Earth.

Though it is said Earth is one of a kind, this article states Venus is the most like Earth planet they've ever found. That could be a valid reason to explore and consider inhabiting, but it is proven with evidence that Venus is inhospitable and would serve no purpose in researching and visiting. In paragraph three, it is said, ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These conditions are said to be inhospitable in paragraph four. It is also said, ""Such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and liquify."" This evidence says the planet is almost impossible to visit and collect data on, except in the fifth paragraph, it is a very long explanation as to how we could even study venus. This is then contradicted in the sixth paragraph by saying photography and videography are ineffective because of the thick atmosphere, and no samples would be possible because the ground conditions are too bad for humans, and even metal.

In conclusion, the evidence the author has given us condradicts and outweighs the evidence given for the idea Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, meaning he did not support this idea.

1b26302,"Dear state senator,

There has been an ongoing conflict on the matter of the proper method to use when deciding on a president: use of the electoral college, or popular vote. I believe that this should be looked upon in greater concern than it currently is. Not only do many people question this arguement, but they feel uncomfortable by it too. I believe the electoral college should be taken away from the process. This is a more secure way of voting because the people of this nation feel as if whom ever they vote for may not actually be voted for by the electors. And this is, in no way, a good thing for the nation.

In the first place, the electoral college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. The electoral college has a seemingly fair way of deciding such a thing. Each state is given a certain number of electors to represent its population (Ex. A small state such as Maryland would have less electors than California). It seems alright, until you realize how unfair it really is... In one way, though rare, the electors may switch outlooks, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented.

Not only does it have the unfair use of electors, but it also is much more inprecise than popular voting methods. While the electoral college, in total, has only a couple hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whoever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In '

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electoral vote, that ""the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country.

In my final point, as not to bore you with countless others, the use of popular vote has already surpassed the electoral college votes, as such in the case of Nixon vs Kennedy, but has not proven enough to win the election. How is that fair, on any level? It shows how most people voted for one candidate, but then have that candidate lose because of the electoral college. Is that not reason enough, to show that people wanted a certain person as president, but because of the electoral college, didnt get as they wanted nor deserved? Not only is it shown in basic reasoning, but it is also shown in the numbers. The electoral college is an unjust way to elect presidents.

I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term. And i speak for most of the people in the U.S. when i say, as Bob Dole did: Abolish the electoral college!    ",5,3.0,,":**

1bfcf1f,"Human emotion can be expressed by many things such as body language, tone, and language. Emotion allows us to understand others and empathize easier. A software known as Facial Action Coding System has been developed to improve accuracy of calculating the emotions of others. Using this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable because humans already can ""calculate"" emotions, the classroom is not taught by a computer, and human emotions are very complex.

The first reason that the FACS is invaluable to the classroom is because there is no need to use technology to ""calculate"" emotions of a student. A classroom consists of a teacher and several students which are humans. The author stated within the article, ""humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day,"" He further on states that we can probably tell how a friend feels just by the look on their face. Since humans can already perceive and understand emotions of others, there is no need for a mode of technology to figure out when someone is bored or confused about certain subjects in a classroom. When a student is bored or confused about a certain subject, he or she could simply ask for help from a teacher or a peer. Using the FACS technology would be redundant in reading emotional expressions of students; Therefore, it is invaluable technology.

Computers are not what teach students in a classroom. The author tells the reader to imagine a classroom computer that could recognize your emotions, so it could ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" There is always a human instrcutor( the teacher) in a classroom, so there should not be a need for a modification of a lesson by a computer when the teacher can modify the lesson. Students do not need to be dependent on a computer to learn what they need to learn in a classroom, and a computer that can calculate emotion is obsolete by its uselessness in the manner of learning.

The final reason why emotion calculating technology is invaluable in a classroom is that emotion is too complex for just a classroom computer to calculate. First of all, emotion differs from person to person. In the aritcle Dr. Huang, a professor of the University of Amsterdam, said, ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,"" but he also stated, ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" If emotional expressions are all unique, it would be very difficult for computers to calculate the exact feeling a students is feeling just by their facial expression. Also, in the seventh paragraph, the author stated, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that the classroom computer would not be able to calculate like how it was used in the article.

In conclusion, the FACS is too redundant and under developed to be of any use for a classroom enviorment. It is invaluable and there are mulitple substitutes that can read emotional expressions of students in a school. In the future, with further innovations, there will be a time where classrooms use this type of technology to enhance education; but as of right now, the system is not useful for helping classrooms teach students.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that the FACS technology is invaluable in the classroom.

1c139c1,"In the United States of America, and all over the world, cars are used every day. People use them to get to work, to go see family, and to get simply, from A to B, but a new idea is sprouting up in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere where people are doing something unheard of.... giving up their cars. According to Source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"",  Vauban, Germany is a city that is almost completely car free. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" THis shws that living without cars is not only possible, but could have some great consequences.

Living car free could seem like something impossible, but it has great effects. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a study ervealing that passenger cars are responsible for 12 peercent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe....and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Without cars, we could lower pollution, which is a huge problem for some places. In the second article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris has to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city after days of near-record pollution. Motorist with even number liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars on day and motorists with odd numbered plates were ordered to the next day. This enforcement had positive consequences along with it. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital and the smog hanging over the city eventually cleared. This shows almost immediate benefits to the decline in driving. Can you imagine the benefits after a long term period of car-free cities? The possibillities are limitless.

Car-free periods of time don't have to be long term. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day takes place every year and it is a ""big hit"" with millions of Colombians according to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". For the third straight year, cars have been banned only excluding busses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog in the city of 7 million. Anyone who violated the rules were fined 25 dollars. For the first time ever, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined in the event. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This should show that car free periods of time are possible, not matter how long, and that they have great consequences that come along with them.

You might say that it would be extremely difficult to make America a car free country. Well, according to a report in the fourth article ""The End of Car Culture"" America may be on it's way. Research studues show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The nummber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter according to a analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. Thsi shows that there is a steady decline in driving and autiomotive transport in America. Also found in the fourth article, if the pattern persists, it will have beneficial impliactions for carbon emmisions and the enviorment. Many sociologists believe the pattern will continue. Alternate sources of transportation have popped up also. In New York, a new bike sharing program has popped up and in San Fransisco, Bay Arear Rapid Transit is another viable option of transport. With all of these options, doesn't one fit you?

In conclusion, alternate transport oppurtunities and car free periods of time are the solution. With so many ways to lower how much and how you drive. The switch to a more economic means of transport would be easier than you think. The possibillities are endless and multiple studies show that the good consequences outweigh the bad ones. One question is yet to be asked, are you ready to make the switch to the better way of tansport?                                                                                                               ",5,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue of car-free living and provides some evidence to support its position.

1c745e9,"FREEDOM!

We are all americans here so we should have the freedom we were ment to have. I understand that we do in fact have a lot more freedom than other countries but I am talking more on voting freedom. The electoral college is, in my opinion and many others, a bad way to decide the president of the United States of America. I beleive that for americans we should have a better say in things and agree that we rather have popular voting than what we have now. Others beleive the electoral college helps with Big States issues. But in the end popular vote is a good way to help people who deserver presidency to get it.

The article The Indefensible Electoral College, many have agreed on abolishing the electoral colleg. The article (The Indefensible Electoral College...) states ""...according to a Gallup poll in 2000... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to what we are doing now."" If we the people do not get final say into things than we are'nt really as free as we are told we are. If the people want a different voting system it should be granted to us. A good example to people who had been effected by this was Al Gore. The articel states. ""Al Gore who had won by popular vote but still lost the presidency to the electoral college."" This goes to show that he was someone that many wanted as a president but where cheated out by the electoral college.

Others may believe that the electoral college helps not let bigger and more populated states get more attention than a smaller state would. But even by popular vote this would be the same. If a populated state votes then they will get basically the same say as they would with the electoral college but it would give them more say. Whilst other low population states get less votes and attention just like with the electoral college. So even though it would make a great change with other things, this matter is no problem.

Few have lost presidency due to the quirks in the electoral college. A good example is Al Gore who I talked about earlier. But still in the future changing to popular vote will help people who earned presidency actually get it. Instead of being scammed out of their votes by the electoral college. If someone has earned the presidencty then they should have the right to it, but with the electoral college in the way some are unable to actually do this. If we the people want someone to be the president than we want them! Al Gore won popular vote but since we do not get the only say he had lost presidency. If popular demand was the only voting system than we would probably be in a better place right now.

In conclusion, we the people of the united states deserve to actually have our own and only say in to who is going to lead us. If we say we want them, we want them... I understand that we our the ones that get the say, but we are being evened out by state percentage, so basically popular voting is ruled out. Popular voting is a better way to vote mainly because it is straight forward and to the point. If someone receives more individual votes than they should be the president... It is a easy straight forward process...                                            ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of the electoral college and provides some evidence to support its position.

1c8d415,"In the article ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming,¨ the author talkes about positive and negative aspects of having diverless cars. Driverless cars can be very dangerous for they can only operate correctly in the right condicions. These smart cars could be putting peoples lives at risk and cause serious problems, and the only way these problems could be truly solved is with a great abundence of money. Aruguments would accure about whos fault it would be if someone were to get into an accident. Driverless Cars need to be highly improved or not put onto the roads, you should always be more safe than sorry.

Therefore, in this article it says, ¨ all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and aroung accidents¨(7). Showing how dangerous these smart cars can really be. If the car can not work properly in the condicions that are all around us, what makes them safe to have on the roads? As the cars keep devoloping the more dangerous they will become to us humans, if smart cars ever get to the point where they truly are driverless it would not be neraly as safe to be out on the roads. This is because these cars are know to have problem with changes in the road and when they notice this change they are programed to alert the human driver. Thinking of that, what if a child were to run out onto the road, how fast can this car really react, or how fast could this smart care alert the human driver? These driverless cars should be concidered hilgly dangerous to humans for they will never have the power to oberate just as a human could.

To futher explain why these cars could only hurt not help human kind, ¨Originally, many futurist believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday was not so much smarter cars as roads¨(3). This idea would help solve many problems that come along with the diverless car, but therfore would cause a great problem of its own. These smart roads would be highly expensive and the only way to pay for them would be the peoples money, and that seems almost impractical. These smart roads used electrical cables and magnets to help guide the car down the road, and with these ideas you would be putting the power into the roads not the cars. And with that these driverless cars would be much saver for everyone. But these roads could never be used for that they would take way too much money to be instaled, saying that driverless cars still remain unsafe.

Overall these cars would also be very hard to get llegalised. ¨Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers¨(9). Therefore, it is already hard enough to keep the drivers alert and watching the road while they are driving now, could you imagen how hard it would be to keep people alert when they have nothing to do? These laws are there to keep people safe and smart cars are the easy way to go not the safe way. Also, serious arguments would accure that would only cause problems not solve anything. Because what if this car gets into an accident while self-driving, would it be the drivers fault or the manufacture? Could you blame it on the driver and say they should have been more alert or say that the manufacture should have made/programed their cars better? These arguments and cases would be never ending, because almost all humans do not want to be saw as guilty so they would do and say anything to get off the hook. As to say, these smart driverless cars would do a lot more harm than help.

To justify my argument that everyone should be against the development of these driverless cars, just think about if it was you. These cars can not be pradictable and no one can be postive what will really happen. But what if it was you who got hurt or maybe a family memeber, because they let these unsafe and unperdicable cars out onto the roads. You would have no one to blame because it was just a machine or just a accendent. They are never meant to hurt but everyone would rather be safe than sorry.

Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast."" With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any run-off elections. Run-off elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.

A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" argues that the Electoral College causes "" the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that  the voters can not always ""control whom their electors vote for,"" We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The resonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.

Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes ""that the electors could always defy the will of the people,"" The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors "" have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.

In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all.                                                    ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that the Electoral College should be abolished.

1cfab57,"Dear State Senator,

It has recently come to my attetnion as I study our states voting system, that we as Americans do not have enough word in who we have as our leader. In a plethora amount of documents from the United States, and our Consitution it states all men are creted equal, when in all relaity we are allowing the Electoral College have more say in who our president rather than we do. Not only does the Electoral College have more say in our President, but it alllows the President to only go to states that they feel is nessisary to go to get the vote. It also gives less say to the smaller states making the people there feel there vote doesnt count, allowing them to vote for any party. If we change our voting system we can vote for our leader rather than us voting for the slate of electors, and have the most popular leader of our country be our president.

The first reason i feel we should overthrow the Electoral College is becasue it is discriminating states votes based on there sizes.  In the article,""Does the Electoral College Work"", it states that becasue of the diffrent sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, "" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote.

Another reason i feel we should favor the popular vothing system is because this would show that the soon to be presidents should vist all of there voters rather then the ones they know they will probably win. ""Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" What the author is saying here is the canidates dont give equal chances to the states to here what they,the canidates, have to say. For example if a democrate is going to states he would most likley avoid the ones full of republicans because he feels he has no chance and does not spend the money. But, if we get majority votes this will allow every indvividual to vote rather a group of republicans. Not only does this allow a better chance of winning for that democrate it allows the voters to feel like they can change there minds because they have a say. This will contribute to the conidates because they can now get there point across to more, rather then to select little groups.

The final reason we should get rid of this system is because at this point in time we are not even vothing for our presidents we are voting for people who vote for us. What i mean is ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose.

As we learn more about this topic we realize how rediculious this situation is. Obviously, going with popular vote is the best solution because we will finally be what everyone has been trying to do for decades, be equal. Sir, i hope you understand my årgument and really take into concideration what i have said. Our presidents make decisions for us everyday, dont you think its time me get to make one for ourselves?

Sincerly,

1d031f0,"Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's ""twin"" and the ""Evening Star"" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work. The author does not strongly support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit due to his extensive reasearch on its toxic living conditions but does acknowledge the benefits of its accessibility from Earth.

Compared to Earth, the author has found that Venus in less less survivable for humans. In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is ""almost 97percent carbon dioxide"" with a surface temperature averaging ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and an ""atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.

However, the author has also found that studying Venus could be beneficial considering its proximity and similar geographical features to Earth. The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the ""most Earth-like [planets]"" as it ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (Paragraph 4). Venus also ""has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability.

Throughtout the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents infomation for exploring Venus being both beneficial and harmful, but he elaborates more on the reasons pointing to the dangers that Venus poses. Compared to current conditions of Earth, Venus does not possess the necessary qualities that would make it a valuable reserve for potentially sustaining human life forms. The author is better able to address the disadvantages of studying Venus because of the extensive research revealing the planet's present volatile state instead of benefits from its similarity to Earth. Therefore, the author fails to thoroughly prove Venus' worthiness of exploration.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view that Venus is not a worthy pursuit for exploration due to its uninhabitable conditions.

1d80630,"Driverless cars: are they really safe? There are many points to go with the postitive and negative things about driverless cars. Both sides have very important points to make. There are, however, many more negatives than positives. Three negative points that will be discussed in this essay are: driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions and put many people in danger, and there is an increased risk of car crashes if driverless cars are used.

To begin, driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers. If a driverless car were to fail to do a task correctly, that mistake could result in an accident. This accident would then bring up the question, ""who is at fault?"" When this question surfaces, many drivers will blame the car manufacturing company, bringing up the point that the car itself failed and not the driver. When this point is brought up, many car manufacturing companies will have to fight lawsuits and have to appear in court. This court showing would result in a large conflict for the company and for the driver, seeing as many people outside of the issue would take sides. The issue would become a large problem for the world, and would be easily settled if driverless cars were not mad to begin with.

Also, driverless cars would increase the amount of car malfunctions that could happen on the road, resulting in an increased danger when going out on the roads. Driverless cars could malfunction in many ways. For example, they could fail to alert the driver when they need to take over, they could fail to communicate that something is wrong with the car itself, or they could fail to drive correctly. Each of those malfunctions could cause serious problems on the road, and put many people in even more danger than they are already in. Although there are many more malfunctions that could happen with a driverless car, they could all be prevented if driverless cars were not let out on to the streets.

The third point is that driverless cars increase the risk of car accidents. Car accidents happen in many ways. If a driver is distracted, if a car malfunctions, if there is a road block, etc. With driverless cars, many drivers will become more distracted, feeling as though they dop not need to watch the road at all and can do whatever they please. However, that is not the case. With a driverless car, people need to be on a higher alert than they would with a regular car: making sure the car does not malfunction, and keeping an eye out for the worst. If a driver were to become too distracted, they would not be watching the road closely enough, and are putting many lives in danger. If the car were to try and get the driver's attention for assistance through an area the car felt it could not drive through, the driver would be too distracted and the car could crash.

To conclude, there are multiple negative effects driverless cars would have if they were used. Driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions, resulting in many lives put in danger, and with driverless cars there is an increased risk of car crashes. Driverless cars are a bad idea, and should not be put on the roads. They put many people in danger. Driverless cars: are they really safe?

1ef4021,"In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Chordless phones are more of an antique than a necessity. People no longer write letters, but rather send a quick email or text. Cars are becoming, and will continue to become, more and more updated as the years progress. As handy as it is to have a car with bluetooth and heated seats, is it a benefit to the lives of 2016 to have a car with no driver? Due to all the challenges the government will face and many of technical difficulties this world faces today, the obvious answer is no.

It is always nice to be able to do less. Sitting back and relaxing is something everyone enjoys. However, when a woman gets into a taxi and imputs her destination, she is entrusting her life in technology. Teenagers like the thrill of roller coasters, until one gets stuck at the peak of the ride. This woman liked the car until the steering wheel got stuck, sending her into a ditch. She liked it before the brakes stopped working because of a wire snapping. Many things could go wrong technilogically, that would make the car ride seem a little bit scary. ""If the technology fails..."" (paragraph 9). Even the author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" didn't deny that many things could in fact go wrong technilogically.

Even if this woman did get to her destination safely, many factors had to take roll in making driverless cars possible. For starters, the law would have to be set. ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" (paragraph 9). It takes 75% of congress to be able to take a law to the president. When it makes its way there, the president can still deny that law; furthermore, it has to go back to the congress and get revoted. Laws put in this position do not normally pass.

""In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" (paragraph 9). It would take many months or even years to be able to pass this law, considering they have all this information about driverless cars and only a few places are allowed to even test them. Questions are raised such as ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" (paragraph 9). Too much time is put into trying to pass the law, and in a society that is looking for ways to save time, it isn't worth the effort.

Furthermore, America has other problems to fix. The government does not need to put this country into more debt by spending its time and money on cars that are even less safe for its citizens. When smarter roads became too high of costs to be practical, people turned to developing smarter cars. ""In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track....something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" (Paragraph 3). For 76 years people have been putting time, money, and energy into making these cars more practical. Cars aren't a neccessity to everyone. Certain religions (such as the Amish) are without cars. Mackinac Island runs by horse and buggy. True, that isn't efficient for this huge country, but being billions of dollars in debt, that time and money could be used to help America pay what it owes. In the mean time, Americans can put up with what they have been using for many years.

1ef816d,"The author does not effectively support his suggestion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He believes that Venus has more value than just a rocky surface that is completely inhabitable by humans right now. Although the author provides multiple details that relate to his suggestion, he provides even more details that contradict his idea.

One way the author contradicts his suggestion is by telling us about the unmanned spacecraft that have been sent to Venus. He tells us how there have been multiple spacecraft sent to Venus but none have survived for a long period of time. For example, in the text the author states, "" No spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This excerpt from the author's article completely contradicts his idea. He says that Venus is a worthy pursuit, but how is he supposed to convince readers this when at the same time he is saying that no spacecraft has been sent to Venus for more than thirty years.

The author also contradicts his idea of the value of exploring Venus by describing the planet. In paragraph three the author says that Venus has ninety-seven percent caron dioxide and has clouds that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid. He also states that Venus has the hottest surface temperature in our solar system and would liquefy many metals. These details do not help his idea at all. They just show how much more inhabitable and worthless Venus would be to explore. It would be a waste of time and money to study a planet that humans wouldn't be able to even live on.

One final way the author does not effectively support his claim is by giving us details about the challenges humans would face even if we were able to make it to Venus. He says that photography and videography would be ineffective and that researchers wouldn't be able to take samples of rock, gas, or anything else while hovering safely above the planet. So even if humans were able to make it to Venus safely, it would be extremely difficult to research Venus. It wouldn't be worth it to spend time and money on an expedition to Venus that wouldn't even allow us to gain knowledge.

The author does give a good point to why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He says that Venus was once like Earth long ago and that it was probably covered in oceans and supported various forms of life. He describes the value of returning to Venus as ""indisputable."" However, he does not give enough evidence to support this claim. He only gives one piece of evidence on why Venus is a worthy pursuit and that is that Venus is closely related to Earth. But throughout the whole article, it seems he is constantly contradicting his statement. The author could have more effectively supported his claim that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by providing details that will outweigh his examples of the dangers and challenges that Venus presents.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue, but it is not consistently supported.

1f0cbec,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming""

the author covers many points and facts about driverless cars. The author speaks about the advantages and disadvantages of the introduction of these cars. The author also speaks about the major companies making these cars from Google to Nissan. Nontheless driverless cars could prove to be unsafe, epensive, and have to many negative possibilites. These negative tradeoffs out weigh the possitive tradeoffs thus showing that introducing driverless cars would do more harm then good.

The article states ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and Pedestrians safe..."" The introduction of driverless cars would make this law harder to keep. This would be because the burden to be safe would no longer be in human hands but in the hands of a cumputer and some sensors. We have all had computers glitch or take a while to repond. It happens all the time. But then the safty of human life is in the hand of a computer it becomes somewhat disheartening. Weather conditions could also prove to be an issue with safty. Would there be a limit to how hot or how cold the environment would have to be for the sensors to work properly? With this much riding on the safty of human lives the driverless car seems to be a very unwise choice.

The answer on how expensive these cars would have to be is partly answered in paragraph six when the author states ""Radar was a device on a hilltpop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasent something you could buy at a Radio Shack."" If Radar back then was two hundred million dollars imagen how much a driverless car will be. Only the elite rich will be able to afford one and the majority of the popution will not. This shows that even if the driverless car was to come out in the near future only a handful of the population would have it since they would be the only ones who could afford it. But this also raises the issue with new roads since old ones would somewhat have to be updated in the long run. The article states that magnetic roads would be too expensive so smarter cars would be needed the roads would have to change a least a little to suit smart cars. With the many things that tax payer dollars are used for there would need to be an addition to smarter roads.

The negative possibilites of the introduction to smart cars are endless. The articel states "" in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This shows that law makers are fearful or the outcomes that some of these cars could create. Also the problem with the rise in law suit when these cars would get into an accident would also have to be put into account. The article adresses the problem of who would be to blame the driver or the maker of the car. Not only would this bring out more problems and law suits it would make it hard to find who was at fault. Also in the possiblity of an acccident if people were to be sleeping or watiching a movie responce time to move the car would be a varying constant from person to person showing that even if people were to get involved the chance to change the situation could be very slim.

WIth all of these negative situations

that driverless cars could cause it could be safe to say than the negative possibilites outweigh the positve possibilites. Driverless cars could prove to be unsafe, expensive, and have many negative possibilites. Showing that driverless are cars are not a very good idea.

1f94e33,"Thinking of the 21st century ideas of driving cars and SUV's around is considred fairly overrated now a day's. Opperating moto vehicle in city scapes and rural areas can get so overwhelming; the constant worry of oncomming traffic and pedestrians steering into your direction, dangerous pollution threatning to dystroy the ecosystems & surrounding landscapes, not to mention expenses that are strung along with the cost driving a car. By eliminating or limiting the use of cars, these unnessary issues would just simply....float away.

As we all know as a result of past generations: Global Warming is on the rise. This statement is esspecially true in the city of Paris, France...named to be the most polluted city in the world amoung tourist destinations in Europe. In a act to reduce these smog issues, ""On Monday motorist with even-numbred licence plates were ordred to leave their cars at home or suffera 22-euro fine"" says Robert Duffer who wrote from the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" in the

Chicago Tribune.

Ever since Paris officals had made this change in leglisation, pollution has gone down considerabley. Imagine driving through your city (for example I live in Jacksonville Beach), and there is no more smog, traffic is reduced, and the air you breathe is actually cleaner than before. From putting certian restraints like the city of Paris did on commuting, you too could experince all the wonders of ""cut-back driving"".

Moving onto another terrific viewpoint of limited car usage is a cut down on cost. Now how great does that sound, and in this expanding economy I'll be happy if gasoline prices drop below $2 dollars! On a serious note, the price tags of a car are extreamly heavy now as they were say two decades ago. There are matanince issues, speeding tickets, parking meter tickets, if you have a flat tire then you call a tow truck which....

COST MONEY!

""New York's new bike-sharing program and it's skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal from ""The End of Car Culture"". Now in modern cities like New York, Miami, or even Jacksonville, many city officals have made this ninche of transportation much easier on civilans. Providing local trollys & public busses to help cut the cost of transportation for their residences. As exemplary from Rosenthal, its makes you happy not to drive a car as often... and makes you wallet happy too!

Although many critics are skeptical to obtain and enforce this idea, in actuallity this would be a tremendous favor to all if they participated. Sure if you don't have a car to use for example on a Saturday, then it may seem like a bummer but in perspective it's actually not! Getting around your local area and exploring all it has to offeroutside the four doors of you ""gas-hogger"" is a beautiful way to go through your day! Just think of all the cha-ching you'll be saving with every footstep you take.

NBC Nightly News . Can you imagine that happening to you, or has it already? Heidrun Walter a media trainer and mother of two says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" since making the change of on-foot commute and biking to distant locations. I live in a beautiful beach side town where almost everything is acessable by walking, biking, city bus, Beaches Trolly, or a surfboard! I myself have tried this and rode my bike up to Trader Joe's to get some ice cream. I can say I felt very stress-free by the whole experince. From simply switching to a non-automatic or mechanical form of transportation I not only relived my tension of road rage. I also had gained great deal of happiness from being outdoors.

In my last few final statements about the pros from limiting the usage of a vehicle, is it's just better.

1fd6b7f,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a paper that sets out to support that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. After analyzing the paper, I am prepared to make the claim that the author fails to do so. He/she presents a vast array of information on the dangers of exploring Venus, as well as the challenges of doing so, but forgets almost entirely to argue that studying Venus is still is worthy pursuit. The majority of the essay focuses on setbacks, not rewards.

The author begins by explaining how spacecraft cannot survive on Venus long, and that previous missions have been short for that very reason. The pessimistic tone is continued in Paragraph 3, where the author describes the formidable heat, pressure, geology, and weather of Venus, and how such intense conditions would complicate research efforts. It states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of hihgly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" In paragraphs 5 and 7, possible ways to combat these road blocks are discussed. Left out of the conversation is the ""why?"" The author describes NASA's efforts to bipass Venus's problems (like designing a hovering device or considering the use of mechanical computers) but doesn't fill readers in on why such pursuits would even be worth the effort. The question, ""We can, but why should we?"" is not answered.

To say that the author was not successful in vouching for rearch of the planet Venus is not to say that attempts were not made. Paragraphs 4 and 8 make a few attempts at telling readers why researching is still a good idea. The author informs readers that Venus is of-interest to scientists because it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Mentioned also is that Venus is sometimes the closest option for planetary visitation, making its exploration a more economical choice than other planets. Paragraph 8, the conclusion, says, ""Striving to meet he challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Here the author is saying that Venus should be studied because we can gather information, and humans are curious. This is not science or fact-based, and is not strong because it is common knowledge, not argumentative material. If addressing why researching Venus is a worthy pursuit is supposedly one of the focal points of the 8-paragraph paper, evidence supporting it should be found in more than two places.

In conclusion, ""The Challlenge of Supporting Venus"" did not do a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In fact 6 out of the 8 paragraphs talk mostly about what a struggle exploration would be, and the work it would require. It focused more on giving the reader facts and figures about why studying Venus would be difficult, nearly impossible, even, but it did not thoroughly explain why such difficulties should be worked through, or why researching Venus is a fruitful and worthwhile endeavor.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue, but does so inconsistently.

1feabe5,"You're keeping your eyes on the road, making sure nothing goes wrong, but isn't that what your fancy car is supposed to do for you? You feel as though you're being watched. That's because you are. You're sitting doing nothing bored out of your mind when you could be cruising down the road, feeling the wind in your hair, feeling completely in control. But you're not. At this point in time, driverless cars are more trouble than they are worth. They are also taking away the comfort and safety that drivers today have become accustomed to.

Throughout the years, there have been many attempts and advances made toward the production of driverless cars. These attempt have not been successful thus far. The driverless cars that have been made are not even truly driverless. They still require the attention of a human. One great idea these car manufacturers had was to make smarter roads, but that is something that would take many years and a lot of money that people just don't have. In paragraph 9 of the article, it describes how there would have to be laws written and passed for this all to work out and lawmakers ""know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This shows that lawmakers are not particularly eager to make this happen and without them it won't happen.

Another reason why the project of creating driverless cars should not be continued is that it would be taking away the comfort and safety that drives today are used to. Even though drivers would not be in complete control of the cars they still ""must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires."" What is the point of having a driverless car if people are still forced to make sure the car is safe? This might even cause fear among drivers because sometimes people feel safest when they are completely control and they know others are as well, but with driverless cars they would not have that security. Sometimes it's even a comfort to people to be able to cruise down the road knowing they can take themselves anywhere they want to go. Even if they weren't afraid they would at least be bored out of their minds like everyone is on road trips. The article also describes how ""the car watches the driver."" Horror movies and tv shows all have illustrated how much people dislike feeling like they are being watched. Not to mention, there are people out there who can hack the cameras in cars and people would never really be sure that the people watching them have their best interests. In paragraph 9 the article also proposes the issue of possible conflicts arising if someone if injured in said driverless cars. Who would be at fault? This would be yet another issue courts would have to deal with when they already have so much on their plates.

Although there are many reasons why driverless cars should not be produced, there are many positive things that could possibly occur if they did exist. Sergey Brin forsees that half of the fuel used in cars today would be used for these cars and there would be more flexibility than buses, but there is no solid proof. It is very possible that instead of roads being full of buses the roads are cramped with cars and traffic would be unbearable. Also, buses typically use less fuel because they are carrying around people that would have used more fuel in seperate cars. Driverless cars have also been proven to go a million miles without crashing, but did these cars have destinations in highly populated areas with many other driverless cars around them? It's impossible to know for sure that this fact means anything without have the proper conditions accounted for. The article also says that the cars could have built in entertainment systems, but wouldn't that just distract the driver from the road? They are supposed to be ""alert and ready to take over"" at all times.

Overall, the continued research and production of driverless cars would be so much work and money used when there is already a safe system in place. Without driverless cars people won't have to worry about things changing or fear for their safety. They can just contiue to live their lives as they have for years. The article says that safety is the most important thing. If that is true, the world is better off without driverless cars.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of driverless cars, arguing that they are more trouble than they are worth and should not be continued.

2027926,"Dear Florida State senator,

I am in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. Changing the election by popular vote is more efficient than the electoral college process. Inputing this into the political voting system would enhance the voting process making it less difficult to deal with, get rid of the electoral college and its faults, and get the U.S citizens opinion on who the president should be and not just the electors voting for the president.

As you are already of aware of, the electoral college is the process where it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and the Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. By the explanation of what the electoral college is, you and I and many others can conclude that this process takes too much work;much more work than really does need to be put into place. Even though most Americans aren't aware of that when they are electing for their choice of the president they comprimise with the most, they are really voting for electors to vote who the next president will be. It's not fair and it's not right.

While reading an article about the electoral college(by Brad Plumer), I noticed that the electoral college system has numerous instances of it that make it wrong. While in place Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. chamber of commerce all agreed on abolishing the electoral college; And I compromise with this agreement because it is completely accurate and make sense as to why these political figures wanted to rid of the electoral college. This is called a ""Disaster Factor"" according to paragraph 11 in the article ""The Indefinsible Electoral College"" meaning that the state legislatures are literally responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. How wrong is this? Also given that so many voter vote for one party for president and another for congress, the House of Representatives' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

In source 3 of the article, it was very precise on as to why the electoral college should no take place. Our country has both republicans and democrats. Not all democrats have the same opinions as republicans, and not all republicans have the same thoughts as democrats. According to paragraph 15, the Electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. This is not fair to people who are democrats. The electoral system is obviously based off of mostly and strictly Republican beliefs. The voting process should be based on just republican bias, but also democrat bias. It's as if the democrats thoughts mean nothing. Paragraph 19 made a claim that Republican bias is baed strictly off of the region in which on lives, because majority of Reoublicans live in the southern states of the U.S. This makes other people(No party, Democrats, etc.) that are inhabited in othe regoins of the U.S. feel disenfranchised and feel as if their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, and that this person is not really their president.

The article gave me an outlook of what the electoral college really is and how it works. The electoral college is not a fair process at all, and it is way the complicated for the people involved in some political job that is involved with the president, it is hard on the citizens that live in this country that have an idea of what president they want to vote for, and it is hard on us as a nation. The election process should be changed by the process of popular vote of the country's citizens. The  electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. The electoral college needs to be abolished as soon as possible. Please take this into high consideration.

From,

20fe8b8,"I do not beleive that the author justifies their statement of ""Venus has value"" in paragraph 8. The author does not explain the pros of exploring Venus as well as they explain the cons of why we should explore Venus. Why do I think this? Well the autor describes the deadly, hot and thick atmosphere of Venus, stating that the reason exploring Venus is worth the risk is because ""Venus still has some features that are analigous to those on Earth."" Well, does that justify spending millions or hundreds of millions of dollars on a rover or a spacecraft to explore it? I don't beleive so.

It's quite simple to explain why Venus does not need to be explored or closly examined from high up in it's atmosphere. The pros do outweigh the cons in this aticle, here is a quote from the author: ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" That temperature is obviously deadly to humans, and that is a major risk when it comes to spending millions on making a rover that will only last up to a couple hours just to get a glimps on the planet. Or maybe just to get a couple pictures. The author does not go on to say how exploring Venus with genuinley benifit the human race. The author simply explains how scientists are curious about the planet and what is on it, I do not beleive that satisfying our curiosity will help anyone. This is a quote from paragraph 8 of the article that states: ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""

Now, to add on to the last quote I stated from the article, the author does not state what the human race would do with that ""insight"" that we would gain about Venus, they just state that we would have insight. well then I would ask the author, what is the point in the insight if we wouldn't be able to do anything with the insight that we have gained from the exploration? All that we would gain from spending millions on sending a spacecraft to Venus would be meaningless insight and the feeding of our curiosity. When there are many bigger issues to be solved here on Earth. For example, the crisis that is curently happening in Venesuala, their government is shut down and millions are starving, some familys have resorted in digging through the trash for food and we could help them, but instead we want to spend money on gaining ""insight"" about Venus? Which the article states that Venus is too dangerous to go to anyway. It angers me that half of New York could be underwater in the next thirty years from global warming but we are worried about getting a small peek into the world of Venus.

I do understand why Scientists would like to go to Venus, it would be a great acheivement for humanity. But I am a firm beleiver that our planet should come first, after all, we do only get one Earth, that means we must take care of it. Maybe one day when Our problems down here are solved and we have the ability to really gain benifits from Venus then I will want us to explore more. But for now I'm sticking to the thought that our planet comes first. In conclusion, no, I do not beleive that the author of this article did a good job at explaining why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers of it. Because in the end it's not just the dangers of going to Venus that keeps me from beleiving that we should. It's the problems that we are facing here on Earth that are far more important.",5,3.0,,":** The student effectively develops a point of view on the issue, arguing that exploring Venus is not a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

2101c39,"Driverless cars are exaclty what you would expect them to be. Cars that will drive without a person actually behind the wheel controlling the actions of the vehicle. The idea of driverless cars going in to developement shows the amount of technological increase that the wolrd has made. The leader of this idea of driverless cars are the automobiles they call Google cars. The arduous task of creating safe driverless cars has not been fully mastered yet. The developement of these cars should be stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur.

One thing that the article mentions is that the driver will be alerted when they will need to take over the driving responsibilites of the car. This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so.

Another thing that can go wrong with these cars is any type of techological malfucntion. Every person with any kind of technological device has experienced some sort of error. Now imagine if your car has an error technologically and it takes the life of one your loved ones. The article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings of the car and that is what helps he car to drive without a true driver behind the wheel. Those sensors could have a malfunctions and be sensing something that is that even there and make a left turn into a 100 foot deep lake. The vibrations that cause the driver to be notified to drive could malfunction and now the driver has no way of knowing that the car is in trouble and now you, the driver, and the rest of your passengers are being buried in your local cemetery.

One last thing that the article mentions is negative about the developement of driverless cars is who to blame for the wreck if there were possibly some sort of technological malfunciton or even some sort of human error when taking over the driving aspect. Should the manufacturer of the car be blamed or should it be the driver? No one knows because there is so many different factors that attribute to who to assign the blame to. Some of what will have to be made is a judgement call. When it comes to insurance and having to pay for any damages you do not want someone to have to make some sort of judgement call. What if that judgement call that was made was the wrong call? Now there are going to be even more lawsuits today in our courts than there already are. This problem alone will just lead to many more issues today in the world that should not have to be dealt with.

With all these things that could possibly go wrong with these driverless cars there is no way that the developement of them should continue any further. In today's society if something bad COULD happen or something COULD go wrong, it WILL happen, and it WILL go wrong. There are just way too many safety hazards that come along with these driverless cars. Becuase of all of these problems that arise with the cars it is just a gargantuan risk to implement these cars into our lifestyles.

2140b9d,"I think that driverless cars shouldn't be developed. These cars shouldn't be developed for many reasons. As of right now, the cars still need driver assistance, but in the future they may not. What will that lead to though? These cars are not completely safe and accident free, many thingscan still happen. These cars shouldn't be developed because it can cause more accidents, the cars may malfunction and the driver wouldn't be capable of conrolling the car themselves, and then there is the problem of some people using these driverless cars, and some people won't be able to use them, which could cause problems as well.

One reason why this car shouldn't be developed is because it can cause more accidents. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver states, ""The car psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge. We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" He is basically saying that this is actually a pretty big challenge, because there are safety requirements that need to be met. There is also no laws for these cars. What happens if someone gets injured? Who is going to be reliable for the injury? Laws are writtern with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. This seems to be true. You can't always rely on robots, as I know you can't always rely on people, but when it comes to crunch time, and you need to make a big decision on the wheel, people are going to do what's best for them, robots are only going to do what they have been controlled to do. Also, these cars can only handle functions up to 25 MPH. There are speed limits that are way above this, and since there are no laws that would help it, the driver may get tickets for noy following the law of the speed limit. Whe you look at the facts, this could cause serious disruptions, serious injuries, and many mishaps on the road.

Another reason why these ars shouldn;t be developed are because the cars could malfunction at any time. You can't always rely on robots. They are only programmed to control certian situations, not all situations. As of right now, the cars aren't reliable enough. It states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" We need to take these things into consideration. Many people are ignorant, and may not pay attntion to te notifications it sends out. This is an accident waiting to happen. What if the driver doesn't hear the alert, or isn't paying attention becaause they give full control to the car? Then things will go wrong, which could lead to accidnets or injuries. Also, it says that the car steers, accelerates, and brakes itself. This can cause problems as well. Since everyone won't have these cars, the car is going to have to rely on the other drivers on the road with them. They are going to have to worry about when the car in front of them goes or stops, when they pull out or pull in somewhere, if an accident happens in front of them, or if there is a road condition that they need to avoid. Also, there is the scenario with lights. WIll the cars be able to stop at lights, or stop signs on there own? If not then this could cause huge accidents.

The last problem is that some people won't be able to use them, and if they do, not efficiently. People, simply put, are stupid, so why would you rely on them to take over a car when the car stops working by itsself? You wouldn't. Some people also have disabilities that can cause them to not hear or snese the notifications, and well there is people who won't be paying attention to the =m either in all honesty. You have to put these things into consideration when making these revolutionary chnages to the world. One incident in the programming could cause serious catastrophic events. Also, not everyone will be able to afford one of these cars. If people can't afford some of these cars, then that woudn't be safe. There would be some drivers that would have the cars, and some that won't. Basically what I'm saying is that some people will go off their instinct and knowledge while driving, while others go off computer programming.That isn't a good idea, ebacsue usually people use signals with each other to figure what they need to do, but the car won't be able to do that. It just isn't safe for the roads to have both driverless cars, and cars that need drivers in them at the same time. People may argue that these kind of ideas are good, and that after all, the cars may be revolutionary and help the world. It's just that robots can't be trusted, as certainly as people can't be either, but people will be able to make the best decision based on the current events at the time. Just think, have you ever seen Irobot? Anything could happe, and many malfunctions could occur.

To basically sum this up, the development of these cars are a bad idea. There will be many more accidents, more malfunctions, and the incapability of people wouldn't help any either. I think that this is a very bad idea, and as much as I want it to be a good diea, I just can't see it turning out fot he best.

21a4446,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to read human emotions has recently been invented. It works by recreating the human muscular motions in the face that are characteristic of certain emotions. Although this technology that allows computers to read emotions may seem irrelevent, ultimately the technology could potentially improve the way that students learn, and help students with social problems that they may have in school.

To begin, the Facial Action Coding technology can be used to tell whether or not a student is understanding a topic. According to Dr. Huang, a professor of the Beckaman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored..."" (6). This would allow the instructor to alter the way that they teach the topic to better convey the message. This can also be used when a student needs some kind of stimulation to be able to focus in class. The author Nick D'Alto also states that the ""software can also identify mixed emotions"" (4). This would allow the teachers to see the students who are stressed and confused and those who are happy and excited. When a student is confused or stressed, the teacher can provide additional practice or tutoring in that subject. The information that a teacher can recieve from the software in very valuable. Humans can read emotions to a certain extent, but some people are good at hiding how they really feel and this can be detrimental to their education. Dr. Huang states "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (6). By enabling teachers to use the technology, they can offer assistance to a student who may not ask for it otherwise.

In addition, students can bennefit from this technology in the social environment. According to Dr. Huang ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (4). This means that if a student were getting bullied but they were hiding it, the teachers could find out the information quickly and help the student figure out what is going on. When a student is identified as being sad or depressed, the computer coud show funny pictures to help the student feel better. In fact, ""according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (9). This means that by smiling, the students will actually make themselves feel better.

Overall, the use of Facial Action Coding technology is very benneficial. Whether it be from a strictly educational standpoint, or from the social envirionment side, the results are in favor of improving the school experience of students.

2235d96,"Twenty five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. While snapping photos of possible landing sites, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The head is nearly two miles from end to end and seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. This head formation is just a natural landform on Mars. On the otherhand, some people think that NASA would rather hide the fact that it could be life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists.

The face on Mars is a natural land form. The article states that, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" This shows that pictures would be taken to prove that the landform is indeed a natrual landform. The text also states that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the face first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This peice of text shows proves that with the pictures, the head is a natural landform. These text peices show that the face is a natural landform on Mars.

The land formation on Mars is was not created by aliens. The article states that, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Mailin's team an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The text also states that, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were any objects in this picure like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" These text peices show that the pictures would have caught any signs of alien incounters so these prove that the natrual landform on Mars was not created by aliens.

Some say that the face has been created by aliens and that it is not a natural landform. The article states that, ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it ws winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" These text peices show that since it was a cloudy time, the alien markings weren't revealed which makes them believe that the face was created by aliens. However, new pictures were taken and shows that if there was alien markings, they would have been noticed which goes to show that the face is a natural landform.

In conclusion, 25 years ago, a face had been seen on Mars by pictures from the Vinking that is a natural landform and looks similar to a human face. Some say that the landform was created by aliens, but there is proof that aliens had no part in the formation what so ever. Few scientists believe that it's a alien artifact but with pictures, alien markings would have been noticed. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.",5,3.0,,":**

2274cbb,"The author of this article demonstrates and tells us a variety of factors that contribute to the fact that although Venus has several dangers surrounding it, the idea of studying Venus is worth the persuit well. Throughout the passage the author tells us the pros and the cons Venus has, but he somehow continues to try to persuade the reader that if more research and studying is done, it will all be worth it in the long run. Not only does he tried to persuade us, the reader, with his writing, but he also includes several facts proven nationwide by professional companies and sources.

The author solely begins to reference NASA and how they play a role in advancing the knowledge of Venus throughout the course of studies. He uses evidence such as, ""Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Just as our jet panes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground condtions by staying up and out of their way."" The text also states,"" Temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author includes this to give the reader a reasonable idea of what one of the largest space companies has come up with to begin to send humans to Venus. Furthering his persuasion, he continues to include details in the text about some of the innovations many researchers are working on that could contribute to expanding our knowledge of Venus.

Following the details of NASA and their idea to visit Venus, the author includes evidence about some of the many innovations researchers are working on, along with how NASA is contributing to help better these innovations. The author does a very good job at describing some of the innovations created, and how they will help contribute meaningfully to our discoveries of Venus. The text states,"" Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The text also states,"" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computer. Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" Although the author does a very well job at trying to persuade the reader that studying for Venus is a worthy pursuit, I completely oppose his idea and what he is trying to do.

My claim of this article is that all the research of Venus and trying to pursuit the idea that it will all be worth it is false. It will not be worth it, and I can support my answer with several different ideas from the text. First, the text states, "" No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This is a major reason because if something like a spacecraft made out of hard metal, with a weight of a couple tons can not survive for more than a few hours, imagine what could happen with the human body. Secondly, Venus provides a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets and contains clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid which if the human body is exposed to, can deteriate and die at an instant. Lastly, on Venus's surface, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what us humans currently experience on Earth. These conditions also have the capability to liquefy many metals. With these kind of statistics from the planet Venus, there is no realistic survival chance for any human body, which is why I completely oppose what the author in this article is trying to do.

The author of this article supported his claim that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. Although he properly demonstrated why he supports furthering studies, I oppose his idea as I read the statistics from Venus and why furthering investigation of this planet would be in reality pointless. This concludes his reasoning behind wanting to continue studies, along with why I chose to oppose his idea of Venus.      ",5,3.0,,":** The essay demonstrates developing mastery of the topic.

227691f,"As we should know, ""the Electoral College is a process not an actual place. It serves as a compromise of the presidential election in Congress and by popular vote"" (paragraph 1). It can be good at times but most times it has its downfalls. The Electoral College doesn't allow for a direct election compared to popular vote. Also, there isn't a fair number of votes for each presidential candidate per state. If there is a tie in the electoral voting process it can cause a big disaster. I don't believe that anyone wants constant problems when choosing a leader. To avoids all of the problems why not take the Electoral College out overall?

First of all, the Electoral college isn't a direct election. ""Under the electorial college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Paragraph 10). In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the polititcal balance that large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment"", (paragraph 21) voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itsself.

It's not only an indirect election but it's also an unfair election. The number of entitled electors per state is based upon the members of the state's congressional delegation. ""One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators."" (paragraph 3). This is unfair because the number of ""House"" members is based on the states overall population compared to the amount of senators. It may somehow be good for the residents who beleive their votes doesn't count becasue of the candidate's regional appeals but what about those who fear that their electors won't choose the candidate in which they favor.

Not only is it indirect and unfair, but it can cause disaster to arise if there is a tie within the electoral voting process. If there is a tie in the in the electoral vote ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives"" (paragraph 12). This is an unfair method also becasue now there's only one vote per state and some states have a higher population than others which can and will cause contreversy in the public. ""The pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, may be redcued"" (patagraph 22) but it still doesn't reduced the fact that swing voters can cause catastrophe within the electoral voting process. This is because they are the most targeted voting areas due to their reputations as the ""most thoughtful voters"".

All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfalls. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the ""tie breaker"" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically ""the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational"" (paragraph 14) and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.

2290a15,"The Electoral College has been around for many years. It is not an actual college, or location. It is a process where American citizens select their electors, however proceeding that the electors make their votes for President and Vice President; Congress counts for electoral votes. But, the Electoral College is a very controversial process, many people are for it, but many are also against it. Some even wanting to get 'rid of the Electoral College overall. We should ban the Electoral College for it does not satisfy American people.

Electors in the Electoral College can vote for whomever they want, giving American people the wrong idea and vote for the wrong presidential candidate. In the article (source 2) ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This quote from the article shows that not always can the American people be guaranteed who their electors vote for, and electors can give voters the wrong information and vote for the opposing candidate. This would be going against American people, dissatisfying them. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" American people can be confused, infused with the wrong information by Electors, and vote for a candidate that has no interest in carrying their state.

Larger states get more attention than the smaller states due to their high number of electoral votes. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it says, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Obama had won 29 electoral votes in Florida (high number) due to him making speeches and campaigns throughout the state. Paying his upmost attention to that state due to the high number of electoral votes he was trying to gain. Whereas in a smaller state such as Wyoming, he would not want to waste time paying much attention there where he can only gain 3 electoral votes! This is simply unfair and at most dissatisfying for the citizens who live in the smaller states with low electoral votes such as Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, etc.

The Electoral College has been around for a long time, and in the end we DO receive a president in the end. But, imagine if this unfairness keeps going every four years an election happens. American people not being guaranteed their candidate, smaller states not getting as much campaign as the larger ones, etc. We do though, receive a president in the end. But what if it's a president that we do not want? That we were not fairly given? Just look at what happened with George Bush! There are many simple advantages to the Electoral College, but there are also many concerns that can outnumber.

The Electoral College should be gotten rid of because of how unfair it is to American citizens. If the issues with the Electoral College are not taken care of in the present, just imagine what our future elections will be like. Us American people need to take a stand against the Electoral College, and the process involved. Once a new popular process is created and introduced, it can provide us more justice and fairness than the Electoral College.             ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of the Electoral College and provides some evidence to support its position.

22ba497,"After reading the article ""Unmasked the Face of Mars"" I believe that these are just natural formed lanforms. One reason is because this face has many similar characteristics to landforms found in the west. Secondly, because the the pciture only show a natural land form after all. Lastly becuase because we have no affical proof that this was once a alien civilization.

One reason I believe that this is simply a natrual landform because of the many simularities it has with many of the landfroms in the west. In paragraph (12) it states that ""What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalnt of a butte or mesa land forms common arounf the American west. Also it states in the same paragraph that "" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars.""

Another reason that this text has caused me to belive that all the face is , is natural landform because when many people obeserved tha photo many belived that is was a natrual landform after all. In paragraph (7) "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for when the image first appeared on JPLweb sie revealing ....... a natural lanform. There was no signifigance of an alien mounument after all. Also earlier in the article in paragrph (2) it state that ""Sientists figured it was another martian mesa, common enough around Cyndonia. Only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh.

The third and finale reason why I believe that this is just a natural land form is beause NASA has simply no proof that this could possibly that there could have been once a alien civilization one Mars (Cydonia). In paragraph ( 2 ) ""Scientists figured out that is was only a common martian mesa, it was only the unusal shadow to make it look like a Egyptian Pharoh. Also on paragraphs (10) though(12) it states that the weather was clear and all they had found was that they had no signifagance to proof of an alien civilization on mars only to have simular characteristics of natural landforms quiet like the ones on earth.

On the other hand maybe its not a natural landform maybe some people may be right it could be some type of alien landform.

NASA could have done somthing to the pictures to mess with the hopefulls. In paragraph (8) states that "" The camera on board the MGS had to peer through the whispy coulds to see that face. Perhaps, siad skeptics , alien markings were hidden by haze. But this has no relevance because on there clear weather second attempt of getting a photo , they figured out i was just a natural landform becuase of the fact that in this photo it clearly dipicked that it had many of the same characteristics of natural landforms in the American west. This proves even though that that could have been a civilization it shows that it was only a landform.

In conclusion, all the Face of Mars is a natural landform because they didnt have any proof that this was an alien civilization. It had many of the same characteristics of many natural landforms in the American West and that it much of the research they had still proved that it was a natural landfrom because of there findings.

2348e16,"Do Google cars truly work? Can humans completely trust a machine to do all of the work for them with their lives on the line? Although Google cars are really interesting and intelligent, these cars cannot be trusted. These cars can only help a person drive and alert them when the task is too hard for the car. All drivers must remain alert throughout the ride, and not everyone can stay alert. Also, what happens if the car ends up in an accident? Someone will have to pay for the price, which can cause immense conflict. Therefore, Google cars should not be produced and sold to customers, for it will cause conflict and danger for everyone.

In paragraph seven, the author states that ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This statement means that the cars cannot drive completely by themselves and will need a person to be alert in case the road ""requires human skills."" Although the seat vibrates to get the driver's attention, it is possible that some will not be able to react quick enough, which may cause a severe car accident.

Because of this problem, people must stay alert just in case they go though a road that requires human skills. The author states that ""the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This may seem like a simple issue, but it isn't; people who drive for a long period of time will get bored if they drive the Google car. In paragraph eight, the author questions this by asking, ""wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" If people get bored of waiting for their turn, then they will do something to get rid of their boredom, hence leading to a terrible accident.

When someone runs into a car accident, most people would blame the driver. In paragraph eight of the excerpt, it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault---the driver of the manufacturer?"" Logically, both of them are at fault; the driver should have been paying attention, and the manufacturer should have known the consequences of selling the car. However, this will most likely unsatisfy the people. Everyone will get into a huge argument which will lead to an enormous conflict.

Google cars are an amazing invention, but it has some flaws; even if ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time,"" people should not trust the car. What about the other 10 percent? The 10 percent shows that it is possible that the car will get into accident, and that accident could lead to thousands of people dead. These accidents will most likely happen because people were not alert during the times they should have been. Can one trust these cars to take them anywhere with their lives on the line, or should they risk the 10 percent and hope for the best?

244db43,"""Boom!"", was the the first thing I saw when I looked up from the passengers seat.Two cars had crached into each other.We were on route 33 going to Fort Wayne.The speed limit there is about 55 mph or 60 mph. Both of the cars were destroyed.On the road there were so many pieces of each car.The crash was extremely bad.The people inside were in a dangorous situation.We called 911 then the police arrived and a helicopter had to get a person and took them. since then the only thing that I think about is driverless cars.Driverless cars development would be

be much safer because they would stop before you crashed,they would accelerate alone, and people wouldn't have to worry about drunk drivers.

Driverless cars would help so many people out.The best thing is that they will stop before you crash into something.The article said that there are cars that can brake themselves.But the driver has to remain alert for when a situation requires it so they are still not that safe.With driverless cars you wouldn't have to be so scared because you would never know when you needed to stop the car.That would help teens out so much.In the TV I always see commercials on teens getting into car accidents and sending there last message to their father or mother.And that does happen because thousands of teens die from car accidents.I also read in an article that every person will get in a car accident sometime in their lifetime.It's really frightning.That's why driverless cars will save alot of people.

Driverless cars would be able to accelerate by themselves and that would be of much help.In the place I live their are alot of deer and there are alot of car accidents due to deer crossing the roads. And if the car could accelerate by itself then we would be able to have less deer accidents.the firt instinct that I have when we saw a deer when we were driving was to tell my dad to hit the break.He ignored me because he read an article that the best thing to do when your going

to hit something is to accelerate not stop.But to many of us we only think on hitting the break not accelerating.Driverless cars are just the best way to go.

There are many times when families die because the person that crashed into them was drunk.So driverless cars would make it safer for us and for them because if a person is drunk they wouldn't have to drive.That would make roads alot safer.The article said that maybe by 2020 some car brands like Nissan will have driveless cars which will be better for all of us.That way no one is in harms way becasue of drunk people.An example could be my cousin he was in a really bad car accident because the friend that was driving was drunk.He was in comma for 2 weeks and the had to do a brain surgey because he was in a very critical condition.The driver only broke a hand but my cousin got the worst.That happens so much these days becasue people are not responsible.I know that with driverless cars those type of accidents will be a thing of the past.

That is why driverless car development would be a better way to go becasue they would stop on there own,accelerate alone and people wouldn't have to worry about drunk drivers.It is something that every country should consider becasue all the gadgets people create are for a better future and I know that driverless cars are going to be the best thing created for the future.That way we will all be safer.

It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end.

It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.

At the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"" and ""Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"". The answers were;not always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.

The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electorals confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guarenteed, will not happen with that comparison.

A winner take all system is in play with the elcectoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candiates focus more on those staes to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.

All in all, the elctorall college and process needs to be abolished and is not fair to the people of the nation voting and being taken advantage of.

2480abd,"A lot of people enjoy the rush of adrenaline. So much energy is rushed through a persons body when they do something that is looked at to be difficult or dangerous. Once they successfully achieve their goal they feel amazing but they do everything they can to achieve there goal even though it could possibly be very dangerous. This is just like in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". In the article it talks about how NASA is interested in studying Venus but they really can't because of all the obsticles they need to get by. But those obsticles don't matter to them. The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Some ways that show that studying Venus is worth it is when it talks about Venus being one of the only planets being very similar to Earth, being one of the closest planets to Earth and the possible inventions that could be made that can change a lot in exploration.

Earth has very different characteristics from all the other planets in the solar system. So when astronomers discovered Venus they were fascinated to see how it has many of the same characteristics that Earth does. Since another planet has many similar characteristics to Earth it sparks curiousity. It starts to create questions which people and astronomers want answers to. So scientist and NASA want to do everything they can to answer some of their questions no matter the risk. In the text it says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" This shows how Venus is shown to be very similar to Earth. It has many similar charcteristics which shows there could have been life on the planet very long ago. The reason it is seen to be worth exploring is because if astronomers continue studying the planet then they could possibly maybe find a way to possibly live or find current creatures still living on the planet.

When people want to really know about something they will do everything they can to discover more. Especially when the thing you want to know more about is right next door. It's like having a child and candy. If there is candy right next to a child they can't be told not to have it and expect them to listen. They will go right for it since it is so close to them. That is exactly how astronomers feel. They can't resist the urge to study a planet that is so close to them. There are many other planets in the solar system which they can't study because of the distance from Earth, but this planet is so close. In the article it says, ""Often reffered to as Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closets planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" This supports how the planet Venus is the nearest to Earth. Making it easier to arrive there distance wise. Yes, there are many dangers of visiting the planet which can make it seem very immature to even risk going, but that doesn't stop NASA. If they have something close to them they can continue doing test and possibly find a solution to reduce risk and fully and appropriately study Venus.

The other reason which NASA wants to continue studying the planet is because of the possible inventions or spark of ideas along the way. If there are new invention or ideas it could change things for ever in the future. It could make further studies a lot more easy. In the text it says, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape...a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide...have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.Another project is looking back to an old tehcnology called mechanical computers."" This shows how many great inventions can be created or even early inventions from before can be used. That leads to more curiosity and encourages NASA to keep studying Venus despite it's dangers.

There could be many reasons for why people would like to continue working on something no matter the risk. For example the study of Venus. NASA and many astronomers continue working on the study despite of the dangers because of Venus being one of the only planets being very similar to Earth, being one of the closest planets to Earth and the possible inventions that could be made that can change a lot in exploration.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

2556150,"Technology today is beginning to support the possibility of driverless cars. However, there are many issues that would support arguments against the development of these cars. This radical idea is actually rather unrealistic, the technology required is far too advanced for any humans to develop in a safe manner. In addition, there are too many safety and law issues surrounding the automatic cars. Lastly, cars that drives themselves would be rather unbeneficial to people themselves. Development on driverless cars should not continue on farther than they already have.

Technology nowadays has advanced farther than we could have ever imagined. It's true that we have now accomplished what used to seem impossible, but how far is too far? Many of the cars that have been developed have incredible technology, but they all still require a reliable human driver. The farthest companies, such as BMW, have come are things like the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car can handle speeds only up to 25 mph, which is far below the speed limit on most roads. The cars are able to perform specific functions on their own, but are all programmed with things to make sure that the driver is fully alert since they can't handle more than slow and striaght driving on their own. The idea of completely driverless cars is unrealistic, which has been proven by the requirement that the cars need a driver to fully take them over in most situations. Too much time and too many resources are being put into an idea that may take centuries to develop, this time and resources could be put into more pressing issues.

In the states, it is illegal for driverless cars to even be tested. If they can't be tested in real life situations, then how will we ever get the chance to develop them? It's true that some states, such as California and Nevada, allow limited use of semi-automatic cars, but thats a far cry from allowing cars to completely drive themselves. The current laws are based off the fact that a safe, human driver is required to be behind the wheel. New laws would have to override current ones to allow such vehicles, which seems to be more trouble than worth. Aditionally, questions on safety play a major role in many arguments. Technology is wonderful and often helpful, but its never 100% reliable. When malfunctions occur, people will get hurt by the destructive weapon that is an automatic vehicle. Also, the question of who would be liable for the accident would arise; is it the manufacturer or driver? Many conflicts between individuals and large companies would begin to form.

Finally, driverless cars may cause more harm than good to the human mind. If the technology to have cars drive themselves is developed, then more and more things will evolve to ""improve"" human lives. In reality, this technology will likely promote extreme laziness in already unproductive beings. While behind the wheel, drivers would get bored and distracted absolutely doing nothing. Even though sensors and other technology are being developed that would quickly alert the driver when the vehicle is in need of assistance and keep them ""safely"" preoccupied, they are not full-proof. As with all technology, malfunctions would likely occur and cause accidents. Also, the driver may have a tendency to check their phone and do other distrating things if they rely too much on the technology, which would cause even more accidents. This again brings up the question of liability. Was it the driver's fault for not being alert or the manufacturer's for failing to alert them?

To conclude, the development of driverless cars should come to a halt. It is true that car technology has advanced greatly, but everything still requires a functioning human driver. This development is overshadowing more important issues of today's world. In addition, there are laws in place that prohibit driverless cars for a reason. It is nearly impossible to test out the development of these vehicles due to these laws, which should be a very obvious sign to discontinue these efforts. The largest issue is safety. Technology is not completely reliable and never will be. Especially in new developments, malfuntions and technical difficulties are very common. Things have been developed that may alert drivers and keep them from becoming bored, but they may promote bad habits. People would become increasingly lazy and become more unsafely distracted behind the wheel than ever. Don't support the development of driverless cars by making sure to be a safe, alert driver and understand how far too far is concerning the development of technology. ",5,3.0,,":**

28028e0,"In 1976 a land form was found on Mars that looked very similiar to a human face. Some people's minds immediatly thought that it was from aliens. This would make no sense because there are plenty of forms like this on Mars. Aliens wouldn't build a form that looked like humans. If it was an alien there would be proof, and we would know. This theory is way to far fetched to be the truth because this is just like any other land form on Mars. We have tons of evidence that prooves that it isn't from aliens and the only ""evidence"" the people that think it was the work of aliens have is that it looks like a face. There theory holds no water, yet people still believe it. Just look at the facts.

They discovered the face-looking form on a part of Mars called Cydonia. On Cydonia there are lots of forms called Martian mesas. It was not irregular to find one where they were at. The fact that it looked like a face was just a coincedence. It only looked like a face because of the way it was shadowing. To actually be from aliens all of the messas would of had to come from them because it was just like any other. There is no way that aliens made any of the others. The only reason that this one is believed to be built by them is only because it resembles a face. I'm sure if you looked hard enough you could find another form that resembled something, and then people would think that it was from aliens, but they're not. You can look at clouds and find shapes in them and people don't think aliens made them. Some think that just because it is on another planet that aliens must have made it, but it doesn't mean that at all.

When people first noticed that it looked like a face they immediatly started thinking that aliens were behind it because they thought that it looked like an Egyptian pharoah. How could an alien that lived on Mars know what an Egyptian pharoah looked like? They are a completely different planet, millions of miles away. Even if it is just a regular face, not a pharoah, still how would aliens even know what humans looked like? And, say that they did know what we looked like, still why would they build this land form to look like us and not themselves? It makes absolutly no sense. If it really was aliens they would want to build of themselves, so they get some credit. There is no way they would of made it of a completely different species.

There is nothing special about this form other than the fact that it looks like a face. It is exactly like all the other forms on mars. Conspericy theorists want to say that we, NASA, know that it is from aliens and that we're just trying to keep it a secret. That makes even less sense then saying that aliens created it in the first place! If we could find something that was really built by aliens, that would be tremedously great for us. If we knew that it was built by aliens we would be overwhelmed by excitement, and we would let everyone know about it. The cold hard truth is that it is just like any other form. The fact that it looks like a face makes some people suspicous, and we get that. Who wouldn't want to know that their is life on other planets, I know I would be amazed if it was true, but it isn't. This is just a really cool looking land form, nothing else. Aliens had absolutly nothing to do with it.

When this face shaped land form was found, even the people on the ship wanted to think that it was made by aliens. It would be great for everyone, especially NASA, but they quickly had to come to reality and realize that it was just like the rest, it just had a really interesting shape. Some dreamers still would like to believe that aliens built this land form, but they to need to soon come into reality. There are so many of these forms on Mars already. Aliens wouldn't want to build a land form that looked like a human. If it was from an alien we would know, and we wouldn't keep it from you. All real evidence shows that aliens were not involved what so ever, but some would still like to believe they were. Just look at the evidence, and hopefully you to will see that there is nothing special about it.

3834cd0,"Humans always want to come up with new ways to make life simpler, wether it be a microwave that runs faster, or even more comfortable running shoes. Those all seem like pretty mundane things compared to what manufactures are developing now. Try to think of a world where cars use half of they use for fuel today, or where nobody has to buy a car because they aren't needed. Thats what manufaturers are trying to do, they are trying to develop cars that do not need drivers, cars that can drive themselves. Since the 1950's people have been trying to develop cars that do not require a driver. Personally I do not agree with the idea of a driverless car.

The idea is a good one but it's been in development since the 1950's and they still haven't made a fully functional driverless car. There are people who say the reason why is because we don't have the exact technology to actually create a car the is driverless, yes that is true, but when will they have the technology. Five years from now, twenty years from now, we don't know and whose to say we will ever get that technology. Google anounced that it had cars that could drive on their own, but only on special circumstances. The cars they have developed the driver still has to stay alert for when the car gets into roadwork, or has to drive around an accident. That could pose a danger because what if the driver falls asleep or isn't paying attention to the road. That could pose a threat to both the driver and others well being.

Also some manufacturers have been developing a smart road system with dual polarity magnets, the cars would read the polarities and would stay on the road. The issue with that is to create a smart road system would take to much time and effort to put together, which make it very impractical. Instead manufaturers turned to smarter cars instead. They desinged it to have sensors that would mimic the actions of a human, like monitering the road, video cameras mounted near the rearveiw mirror, and a inertial motion sensor. It all sounds very grand, elaborite, and very expensive.

In 2013 BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assist"". The car would be able to handle driving functions at a speed of twenty five miles per hour. However, special touch sensors make sure the driver always have their hands on the wheel. I see multiple issuse with the idea of a ""Traffic Jam Assist"", first off the car can only take control of functions at speeds of twenty five miles per hour. Also the driver has to take control if they are to go over twenty five miles per hour. In fact none of the cars that have been developed actually are truly driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake, but the driver still has to take control sometimes. What would happen if the driver got distracted or fell asleep at the wheel? Disaster would follow.

There are many perks about driver less cars, less fuel being one of them but there are also many issues I see with the cars developed. Having to have a driver in them ready to take over if nessesary, some states not allowing driverless car test, not having the exact technology needed to make these cars a safe as possible, and not to mention human error that can always occur in driving. I believe that maybe in the future when technology has advance more then maybe diverless cras wouldn't be obsolete. But right now in the era of 2016 driverless cars are not needed. Mainly because we still have driving issuse that need to be solved like people getting distracted by phones, reackless drivers, and cars that aren't built good to begin with. So in the future they might have a purpose but until they can develop a car that is completly safe and has the technology needed to create it, we simply do not need driverless cras.

385790a,"Driverless cars are a relatively new concept in the automobile industry, and the benefits they offer could potentially decrease the risk in driving, especially given the inconsistencecy of drivers in today's world. While this is a tempting and seemingly perfect solution to reducing the number of car accidents, I do not support the idea of driverless cars.

The author states in section four that, ""The combination of all of this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel"". While humans are not in any way perfect drivers, the natural instincts and reactions of a human behind the wheel are impossible to capture in the form of sensors, robots, or mechanincs of any kind. In situations where unorthodox solutions are needed to remain in control of the car and keep from crashing, veteran drivers have the knowledge and experience to do so. Robots may have programs to react in certain situations, or to move out of the way if an object is coming towards the car at a rapid speed, but not all situations can be programmed. Robots simply cannot react the same ways humans do, which brings me to my next reason for not supporting driverless cars.

Section eight of the passage focuses on the psychological aspects of driverless cars, and introduces thd idea of laziness and boredom in human nature. Later on, the author states that some manufacturers hope to address this problem by including entertainment in the cars to remedy this boredom. Bringing in car entertainment wuld only further distract the now obsolete human drivers from the road, which in the case of an emergency, could prove fatal to not only the driver, but the passengers in the car as well. The Google car mentioned in section 7 ""Announces when the driver should be prepared to take over"". If the human did not hear the car announce this, and the car was reverted to the drivers control, the driver might end up in a crash. If the driverless cars provide more distractions than are at hand in the world today, no matter if a human is driving or not, the human driving the car could end up dead along with the passengers of the car. If driverless cars do become a reality, human drivers may one day become obsolete.

Today's world is focused heavily on transportation and getting from one point to the next. Driverless cars would fufil this requirement, but without the help of human drivers. The more that driverless cars would develop and improve, the less and less amount of humans would know how to drive. While this does not seem like a major problem if driverless cars were a reality, but the malfunctioning of systems would prove to be chaotic. If there was a systemwide problem with driverless cars, all of the vehicles in use, malfuctioning or not, would have to be recalled and fixed, causing mass hysteria. Because of the loss of driving skills, nobody would know how to drive. Humans would be unable to travel places, go to work, or do recreational activities.

Driverless cars may promote many benefits to humans seeking leisure and comfort while driving, but driverless cars could prove to create some very serious safety issues, especially on the busy roads of today's society.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view against driverless cars, but it does so inconsistently.

3946e1a,"Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point b. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possible. Cars are a suitable to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a public bus, but those other forms of transportation just might be the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an absolutly amazing thing but, maybe they just cause way to much stress, and maybe they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a bus or a train you do not have to worry about washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a bad traffic jam on I-4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, but there are many advanteges to limiting our car usage.

One advantage that not only humans would benefit from, but also plants and animals is that there would be a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extreamly harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhuast pipes in our cars. Your car alone dosent give off much gas but collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in big cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record breaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ban on cars. This is described in the second article "" Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, "" On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" After France limlited driving there congestion was down by 60 percent. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columbia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, it describes the annual car-free day they have to reduce smog. "" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". So all over the world people are relizing that wilthout cars, we are insuring the saftey and well being of our environment.

The second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. Haveing to repeatingly wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the back of your car screasming and yelling all while music is blasting, causes stress. So obviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not be as stressed as we usually are. There would be no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article "" In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a citezen named Huidrun Walter, states "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". So with out the stress of a car Huidrun Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, "" Car-free dai is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, it states "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.

In conclusion, there are many advanteges to limiting car use, one being theat we get to help the environment and two being that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to become the healthy enironment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to be unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get better and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it. Some might not think that this is an advantage, but i just explained that it is a clear advantege that has been proved to help the enviornment and reduce stress. Limiting car use is a very effective advantage that really does work in more than one place.            ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of limiting car usage, arguing that it has advantages for both the environment and stress levels.

425d8c4,"With the rise of technology and accesability, students in schools are bound to wonder away from the current lession and tred towards their phones in the face of bordom or general stress. How can we fix this you may ask, with emotion detecting technology. This technology can help schools in that it focuses on specific muscle groups, can detect false emotions, and can help students get beck to the task at hand, school.

First off, how does this technology even recognise emotion? Emotions are always displayed by body poster, facail exspressions, and speech. This technology primarilly focuses on facil exspressions. By focusing on 44 major muscles and a 3D model created within the software through a camera, can effectively distinguish 6 basic emotions. These emotions are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the must move like human muscles....six basic human emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" This technology works so well in fact that it was able to calculate the emotions on a painting. The one and only, Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. In this instance of the painting, the software concluded that she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This being said, you can see all of these features in the painting with her smile; however, her smile is also seems to be hiding other small emotions that can be portraied as insecure but wholesome. If this technology can effectivly 'see' the portrable emotions off a painting, then it can most definatly can be used within the school systems.

What about the common conseption that students go to school with a smile but arn't really happy? It can do this too. It comes to that facail movements can be seen as true or false by the muscles that are being used in that moment in time. Such as the muscle group, zygomatic major, used in a genuine smile; however, in a false smile you also use the risorius. ""But in false smiles...using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" The usefulness of this technology doesn't stop at just being able to identify false smiles but teachers can use this information to more effectively connect with the students. When a student is a distracted by stressers, they can't focus, and when they can't focus, it makes the teachers look like they arn't doing their jobs properly by the test score of the students because of it. This stratigy however, is nothing new. In the eyes of an exspert, facail exspression tell your true intentions. ""To an experts, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celbrity isn't being truthful."" Thus, this late technology doesn't seem to far fetched to use in our schools.

As I breafly mentioned in the last pharagragh, students need to be able to focus in order to be seccesesful in school. With modern stressers that teachers sometimes don't see as big deal, students on the other hand may lead to distraction. With these stressers far and wide, how do we identify them? By using the facail recognition software. Say for instance a student as his or her mind elsewhere besides the classroom and is missing out on a major transition lession that is the key to the next few lession. They won't get it and will further lead into new problems. But say that the software picks up on the student and detects that he or she is feeling angered, depressed, or just has a lack of intrest. This software can then send the data to the teachers computer thus letting them know that they may need a recap or support in general. Thus further action can be taked by the teacher to strengthen the bond of students and teachers. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Another way that it can be used in the classroom as if the students is angered and frustration is building inside because their minds are in two places at once to only confuse them even more. The software can be designed to shut off the computer, alowing the student to take a breath and contemplate on what is wrong themselves before an intructer aid them in the personal mater before continueing on into the lesson as a whole. ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above yours eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" In short, the possibilities are atronomical when thinking of incorperating them into a schools systems.

In short, the addition to facail recognitions systems into the schools is a great idea. Thus it can recogize emotions effectively, detect false emotions, and help students regain focus within the classrooms.

42e55d6,"The Electoral College is a cruel, pointless process that simply makes a percentage of votes, or all of them if you look at it that way, to mean nothing, and allows for circumstances like the 2000 election. There are plenty of reasons, and plenty of contradictions in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised mehod of choosing the President.""

To begin, the winner-take-all system is very unfair to the voters. Voters in certain, dominated areas are supposed to know what they are voting for, yet get nothing to teach them? Not that it matters regardless, since every person within a state supports a political party, right, and, depending on your state's veiw, all Republicans/Democrats have no idea what they are voting for, correct? Like Bradford Plumer says, you shouldn't have to move to Ohio to be able to get a vote. There is also the point countered Mr. Posner's article, which is that those in party-dominated states will have a feeling their vote doesn't count, and he sais that one vote will not swing an election. Then why do you beleive an upside of the elecoral college is that those in more neutral states will feel their vote counts? Or do those in party-dominated states not matter, since those in neutrals think way more about their votes, and are the only ones you should trust, according to him? In practice, they are the only deciding factor .

There are also the many unwanted results from electoral colleges, such as the 2000 election's outcome defying the people. ""What Is the Electoral College?"" states you are voting for electors when you vote, but what is the point if they can simply defy you? It would be like if after the president was chosen, the Senate could overule him with a 1/5 vote. There is also the point in Plumer's article about the time Hawaii sent two slates, which forced the desicion to Nixon, who had to validate only the opponet's votes in fear of otherwise receiving bad publicity. There is also the strange way of resolving a tie, which boils down to the same thing as the winner-take-all system, except if more people support  it doesn't matter. It would be like if everybody in the  room wasn't alowed to vote, other than one voted, but everybody in the room agreed anyway for some strange, miraculous reason. (Of course, the one guy in the  next room doesn't agree, and completely takes out your vote, regardless of the fact that there were 30 people in this one.)

Now, there is the gregarious amount of contradictory statements that can be found within Mr. Posner's article. One has already been mentioned in the winner-take-all system paragraph. He also conveintly provides a dispute that had nothing to do with a close vote in the Electoral College, and everything to do with what is wrong with this winner-take-all system, being the 2000 election. In the same paragraph, me mentions how an Electoral tie is highly unlikely- as if a tie between the millions of US citizens is. His reason #5 can be easily solved by simply giving the presidency to the candidate who receives a plurality of votes, rather than a majority. Reasons number 3 and 4 both contradict reason 2 as well, stating that everybody gets a vote, only swing states should get a vote, and only bigger states should get a vote (even when there is a 51/49 split, where 51%=100%, mind you).

Thus, the Electoral College is completely unfair to voters, and should be abolished. Voters should not have to vote for other votes which could very well defy their's, why not just have the Electoral Cllege do all the voting then? It is both redundant and unfair.

42f073f,"Driving is often one of the most frightning things to many peole whether they are starting to get their permit, or if they've been driving for a long time. The idea of driverless cars came to the mind of Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google. He even envisions a future where the public can have access to a transportation system such as cars that can drive themselves, and a public-transport taxi system that uses half the fuel of modern cars. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author wrote about the positive and negative sides to these inventions. The article covers many things about them; however, it does not fully explain the true nature of such vehicles being available for public use. These cars should not be allowed to be bought and used by the public.

As stated in paragraph two of the article, it states that these driverless cars aren't fully driverless. These cars have no crash thus far, but how safe is it really compare to their rival brands? ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents,"" What the sentence means is that these cars don't have one hundred percent control of how they drive. They require the driver to be full alert when pulling in and out of their driveways. Little do they know, that accidents can still happen when they have claimed they are better than any other car brand that uses the same radars and sensors.

Google isn't the first company to think of a smart car which isn't a surprise to those who have looked into different car brands. Companies like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by the year 2020. In 2013, BMW announced their development of a car called the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The difference between the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" and the driverless car is that BMW added a design to where the car itself notifies the driver when human skill is required. Another design element to the car is that the driver's seat actually vibrates to alert the driver when the vehicle is in danger of backing into any object. This choice of car is more safer than the driverless car as the Google car relies on the driver to focus on the road. Every driver has looked away from the road before, so it wouldn't be a surprise if an accident were to occur. Though there is another safety mesasure added to the Google car, a camera to watch the driver to make sure they keep their eyes on the road ahead. This could lead to some issues for privacy as people have been sensitive in the pass about their identities being shown to corporations. Not only could this lead to court sessions, but also lead to a possible debt for the company.

As stated earlier, the author did list both negative and positive things about the Google car. Paragraph eight shows the psychological side for drivers with this car, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?

We have to interpet the driving fun in a new way,"" Dr. Werner Huber stated. Manufacturers hope to do that by having entertainment and information systems that have displays that turn off when the driver needs to pay attention, an option drivers who want to use their electronic devices do not have. It is stated that this option is a safety feature; however it could be more of a distraction. The use of electronics has increased, and today's modern society is easily distracted by this. When the car needs the driver to take the wheel, how will the driver react while they're busy looking at a screen? Safety is a big concern, and so everything should be looked at and thought through.

States nationwide have already made it illegal to drive test computer-driven cars. Some states have limited the use of it, and it is because the safety of the cars are still not certain. If the car is proven to be of safe use, new laws will have to be made and so will the coverage of liability in a case of an accident. If most states have seen it as unsafe, why continue to research ways to make smart cars? Automechanics have focused on their work, and assume that these problems will be solved in the near future. How can we be so sure?

Technology everyday is improving little by little, and so is the need to travel. We have the technology to make whatever the mind wants to create, but some ideas should stay ideas. It's not a terrible ideas, but it could bring more trouble for everyone business to home workers alike. Safety to the public should always be the number one concern, not how high tech the car itself is. Instead of causing more accidents due to the car mechanics, we should let the drivers learn properly how to drive.",5,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue of driverless cars, but it does so inconsistently and with some inadequate examples and evidence.

4301d19,"The Face on Mars

The Face that was found on Mars, was not created by aliens, it is a natural landorm. It's a natural landofrm becuase, scientists studied it, it is popuar, and there are pictures. Some may not believe that this is a natural landform. But, there is some information to make you want to believe it.

Stuides by scientists have shown that this Face is not just like any other. It was not created by aliens, and it is not normal. In the text it says,''Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.'' This describes how unusual this Face looked. There is no way that this Face was created by aliens. It is far more detailed that what aliens could have done.

The Face that was found on Mars, was very popular. The uniqueness of the Face made it stand out more to others. In the passage it says,'' It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lanes for 25 years!'' This tells the reader how the Face on Mars was important to most people. The Face on Mars was to be known all over the world.

Scientists took pictures of the Face on Mars. The pictures let you know what they look like and it gives you an idea of what they are describing. In the text it says,''Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.''

There was trial and error problems with the pictures. In the text it says,''The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.''

In 2001 they took another picture, and this one was more clearer that the one taken in 1976. The text also says,'' Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's aboslute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 neters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Some apponents may say that the Face on Mars was made by aliens. Maybe they have a point. In the text it says,'' Some people think the Fcae is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-eveidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.'' But, the photos that were taken make it clear that there is no way the unusual Face was made by aliens. In the text it says,''As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

As the years go on, people may still wonder how the Face on Mars was made. Some may still think that the aliens did it. Others might never get to know the real answer.

Some say that the Face reminds them of something on Earth. Thus, this must mean that the Face on Mars is a natural landform.

438648b,"Some people say that ""The Face on Mars"" is something that was built by ancient aliens, much like the theories that people come up with about the structures on Earth. Some people have even stated that the ""aliens"" could be trying to cover it up by hiding it during the time they take it. Then there are the firm believers that this is just a land mass that consists of the surroundings and resembles a mesa type biome. Since there have been developments over time, showing the different variations of the ""face"" and what it has become over the years. There are different arguements and different points of view, but there are different time periods with different variations of the same thing, so it will be proven that is is a natural land mass, and not a martian made structure.

There is a lot of things that points toward this being a natural land mass and that it is not a Martian made structure, or that the Government is trying to cover it up. One thing that shows that it is a natural structure is when the article states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough aroud Cydonia..."" This means that there are multiple things like this, but the only things that make this one different is the fact that is has ""unusual shadows"" in it that make it look human or like a structure that was built. After this happened and people got news of it and figured out it wasn't real, the Conspiracy Theorists came out and made it seem like a cover up, but this isn't true, because NASA could have gotten publicity from it, as well as many funds. This mesa is no different from anything that we have in Western United States, there we have many mesas that could look equally as strange, but we don't bother, because we want to believe that there is other life, or that there is something strange going on in other planets.

Over the years, the images of this land mass have gotten more and more clear, and we have come to realize, that no, it is not a face, but it is a large point with shadowy parts in it. From the picture from 1976, it is really blurry, and you can't really tell what it is, which is what got people hopes up and thought it may be a structure, due to the shadows and the formation around it. The 1998 one is a bit clearer, but it still is a bit unclear of what it is or could be, because it does look like it could be something like the Sphinx in Egypt, but with the same formation around it. The 2001 image looks way more clear, and this one shows something completely different than what we expected, it is just a regular mesa, with cracks, dips and shadows, and the same formation around it as before. There is something you can tell about the 2001 picture though, if you look closely, it is the same image as all the others, because you can see the dips in it where the ""eyes"" and ""mouth"" are, just more clear so they don't really show up, and since everything is more clear, you can see the cracks, which could have added to the effect.

Even after all of the theories that were made, and NASA defending themselves, as well as people trying to prove them wrong, and prove that there was something that the government did to cover it up. All of this could still be fought, who knows, there could be life out there somewhere besides on Earth, but as of now, there is no proof, and this image will still remain a natural land structure. Some people are dissapointed by this, others are motivated to keep moving and possibly one day find some signs of life, so maybe humans would be prepped and set in case of disaster. There is nothing wrong with personal opinions, but for the most part and from what pictures and plenty of evidence have proven, this is still no more than a natural occurence do to the way land forms over time. So even though people may keep looking for any signs of something that could be a conspiracy, or you just want to find something ""supernatural"" or strange, but the fact stands that there are many thing like this, and just because it is on a different planet, does not make it anymore special, and it doesn't make it any different.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue, but it is inconsistent and does not provide adequate evidence to support its position.

In ways, the Electoral College could be dangerous to use unless you have electors that are completely faithful in their party, and do not take advantage of getting to choose where to place their vote.  Basically, voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then elect  the president.  These electors can go against the people's majority votes and decide who to vote for.  It could also be possible that a state sends two slates of electors to elect.  If the election was a direct vote, there would be almost no chance for a tie to happen, but with the Electoral College, there is always that possiblity.  Some states do not even see the candidates because of the majority of the people living there belong to a single party, and the ""winner-takes-all"" system completely affects this.  If the elcetion were to be a direct vote, the candidates might visit the states in order to gather as many votes as possible.  However, many of these reasons that the Electoral Collge should be abolished are just one time things, so consider the other side of the argument.

Swing states basically decide the election and therefore, they are the most thoughtful voters.  They know that they will be the ones to decide the election, so they pay more attention to the news, and the candidates' campaigns.  The swing states receive the most information and attention from the candidates.  Since they will end up deciding, the candidates want them on their side.  Many sates are already pedicted, even before the election, as a majority of them are from one party.  These voters think the most about who they want to run our country and who will do the best in that position, so they should be granted the honor of making the decision.

Electoral votes help avoid run-off elections, by reducing the pressure that might complicate the election.  Say that our government referred to the direct vote system, with a lesser system known as the Electoral College was for comparison, and during the presidential election, there happened to be a problem with the popular votes versus the Electoral College; this complication could be avoided if we used the Electoral College.  This has happened with nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, when they both had only a 43 plurality of the popular votes but were winning in the Electoral College.

The Electoral College could be unwanted by many minority voters in states that leaned completely one way.  These voters hardly pay attention during the campaign because they know that their vote will hardly make a diffference in their state, but a voter's vote could not swing a complete election, and not the full population voted in the 2012 election.  Voters usually just like to express their preference and have it known than decide the vote that will make an election.  It is more likely that your vote will count if you are educated in the happenings of the government, and maybe your vote can make a difference.     ",5,3.0,,":** The essay provides a clear point of view on the issue of the Electoral College and supports it with several reasons. However, the reasons are not always well-developed or supported with evidence. For example, the student claims that the Electoral College helps avoid run-off elections, but does not provide any evidence to support this claim.

44ce55e,"Should we or should we not we should use computers to help identify emotions is up for debate, but in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he explains some new tech and why we should use computers to help us see emotions more clearly. D'Alto explains reasonons why they are useful in ways such as ads that can tell if you like them or not, education and telling of kids are confused or bored, and some other possible things this new technology could help with. However, I believe that even with all of our technology and advancements in many fields of it, we should not use it to help find emotions for us.

Human emotions are a very complex thing, and with that complexity it makes computers not very useful, even with their algorithims and equations. In paragraph 3 D'Alto explains how the process works ""The process begins... must move like human muscles...Eckman has classified six basic emotions...your frontalis pars lateralis... raises your eyebrows when you're surprised."" This is a pretty interesting way of seeing emotions and a very complicated one. However D'Alto writes ""your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" What he doesnt adress is other people face shaps, such as if you have naturaly small lips it doesnt mean that your angry, or that simply raising you eyebrow in a photograph means you're surprised, maybe the person is just striking a pose and nothing more. With all the people in the world, and all of them being different its hard to tell if the comupter will be able to read all of their emotions accuratly or at all.

Next, D'Alto explains to us that we use this calculation (reading people emotions) every day in paragraph 5. He says ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" In this statement he says that humans themselfs have a hard time decribing emotions on the face and what they mean sometimes. If you really think about this if we cannot describe emotions and we're the ones doing them, why should we believe a computer thats coded, by us, will be able to? Its not an easy thing to do, and even with psychologist such as Dr. Paul Eckman its a seemingly impossible task to get a non emotion giving machine the ability to read emotions, accurately.

In the article ""Making Mona Lise Smile"" Author Nick D'Alto writes about new tech and why is should be used. He provides some evidence and reasonings for things that this new technology could possibly improve or do for us. However D'Alto does not show the counter arguement in his article, and doesnt give any information on how this new tech could fail, or not work very well. Its hard to tell where computers and technology will go in the future, but with this I can say that its a almost impossible job to give a computer, not able to feel emotion, the ability to read them accuratly. Its an interesting idea to give computers and machines to ability to read emotions and possibly other advancements. But only time will tell if this new technology will be able to read our emotions. This technology could possibly put us on a path to understanding more about ourselfs, or it might fail and a new technology will start to be developed and worked on in its place. The dabate on if computers and machines reading human emotions and many other things is a big one, and only time will tell where it will end up.

44d0218,"Dear Senator of Florida,

I belive the electoral college should be abolished as a process over all. The electoral college should be abolished because it does not benefit the U.S. in anyway and has caused multiple problems in elections over the past years. The electoral college should not be a part of the U.S. Constitution and it only causes issues while elections are present therefore we as a country should elect by popular vote.

The electoral college should be abloshied because it has caused multiple problems over the past years during elections and could continue to cause problems. The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their partie's candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee pesidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one inncident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford Plumer's article, in 1960 segregationists in Louisiana's legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated ""the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational."" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair.

The electoral college should not only be abolished, or destroyed, because it causes problems but also because it does not benefit the United States in any way. The outdated, unfair system just hurts the U.S. government and the country as a whole, it does not benefit our government or citizens in anyway what so ever. Under the electoral college system voters are voting for a slate of electors who don't always vote for their own party candidate rather than voting for the candidate they want to govern our country. 60% of voters would prefer direct election and popular vote anyway so why not throw out the old worn down process that dosent work and replace it with something the people of this country actually want, popular vote. Some people might say we should keep the electoral college because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee so nothing can happen but according to history things can happen such as in the 2000 election. Why keep a process that the majority of the citizens of this country don't want and a process that just causes issues.

The electoral college is a thing of the past, a has been that almost no one wants around. Popular vote elections would be more fair and will not have mistakes during elections like the huge mistakes the electoral college system has proven to display. The citizens of America want the electoral college gone and popular vote elections should be what the government is aiming for so we do not have mistakes in our elections and so the U.S. can benefit from actually having a working election process.                    ",5,3.0,,": The essay develops a clear point of view that the electoral college should be abolished.

450aa09,"In years past, the number of people interested in, and using cars around the world has dropped noticibly. A marked shift in the ""car culture of the world has occured, leaving many wondering what is tocome.  Limiting car usage has many positive aspects, such as saving money, that people tend to be less stressed when they do not drive as much, and reducing pollution and greenhouse emissions.

One of the many positive aspects of reducing car usage is that one will save money if ones car usage is reduced. In an article by Robert Duffer  called ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says: ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were orderedto leave cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)."" In Paris, car-owners were charged money for using cars on certain days. This was done in an effort to reduce traffic in the city. Another article that addresses this is ""The End of Car Culture""

by Elizabeth Rosenthal. She says: ""Part of teh explanation certainly lies in the recession,  because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars..."" Cars are a costly thing, and many people cannot afford to put the money in to having and maintaining an automobile. Car cost so much,so reducing,or even eliminating usage will save anyone a great deal of money. This is one of the many advantages to limiting car usage.

Antoher reason to limit car usage is that people tend to be less stressed,and more happy when they do not have a car to worry about. In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal, she talks about Heidrun Walter, who say thatshe is actually much happier no w that she does not own a car,and that owning a car was very stressful. No one wants to be stressed,so why would people want to put themselves through the trouble of owning a car? Lowering car usage has been shown to reduce stress, which is a good thing for people, mentally and physically. Andrew Selsky also addressesthis in ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota,"" where he says ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress.'"" As is outlined here, rducing car usage lowers stressin many people, which is definitely an advantage.

Reducing polution and greenhouse gas emissions is another advantage of limiting car usage. carscreated emissions dangerous to the environment, so reducing usage will have a positive effect on the environment. In ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota,"" Andrew Selsky discusses the mayor of Bogota, Colombia's descicion to have a day free of cars in the city. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" In Bogota, as in most cities, smog from car pollution is wide-spread. Lowering car usage lowers the levels of polution and dangerous emissions in cities. A similar situation is outlined in Robert Duffer's ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says ""After days of near-record polution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This gives further evidence that reducing car usage will lower pollution and smog in cities around the world. Concurrently, Elizabeth Rosenthal, in her artilce ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" she says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emisssions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" This provides further evidence that cars release an enormous amount of pollution, and usage must be lowered.

Limtiting ones car usage has many positive consequences, some of these include saving money, reducing stress, and lowering polution levels. These are all great reasons to limit car usage, and many people are beginning to take hold of these advantages around the world.            ",5,3.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 3**

**Specific Feedback**

**Content and Development**

* The essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support the claim that limiting car usage saves money.
* The essay could also provide more analysis of the psychological benefits of reducing car usage, such as reduced stress and increased happiness.
* The essay could provide more evidence to support the claim that reducing car usage reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

**Organization**

* The essay could benefit from a more logical flow of ideas. For example, the paragraph on saving money could be placed before the paragraph on reducing stress.
* The essay could also benefit from smoother transitions between paragraphs. For example, the transition between the paragraph on saving money and the paragraph on reducing stress could be improved by adding a sentence that explains how saving money can lead to reduced stress.

**Language Use**

* The essay contains several errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics. For example, the sentence ""Limtiting ones car usage has many positive consequences"" should be ""Limiting one's car usage has many positive consequences.""
* The essay could also benefit from more varied sentence structure. For example, the sentence ""Cars are a costly thing, and many people cannot afford to put the money in to having and maintaining an automobile"" could be rewritten as ""Cars are expensive, and many people cannot afford to purchase and maintain them.""",2.0
451c89c,"The use of facial technology in a classroom is a fantastic idea. If a teacher knows how a student is feeling maybe behavior problems could be avoided. Test scores could start to rise because if a teacher knows how you are feeling maybe they can adjust their teaching a little, so you might understand more. Just think of all the possibilities that could happen if a school used facial technology.

Students get angry throughout the day and so do teachers. If you are hiding you are not angry and then one thing tips your boat, that can cause a big scene to occur. With the new facial technology things like this could be avoided because whoever is in your classroom would know how you are feeling today. It might even be a good thing to use this technology on teachers, not just students. Teachers get angry and upset too, so using this technology could help a student know that their techer is struggling a little bit and maybe to give him or her an easier day. This could also allow the students to help better the teachers mood so things may get a little better for him or her.

Now test scores could really benefit from this new technology. If a tecaher knows when a student is bored or confused then the lesson could become modified. The teacher would know that maybe one student or even the whole class is not understanding what is being taught. The teacher could then do whatever they think is right and try and fic the lesson. At the bottom of paragraph two Dr. Huang says what I stated in the sentence above. Think about it, test scores would sky rocket if teachers knew that a student was still confused, but maybe was afriad to ask a question. If the techers also knows a student is afraid to ask a question then that could help the teacher know to maybe boost the student's cofidence more. If a teacher could find all of that out maybe he or she could simply run through the lesson again or ask the student if he or she might need a little extra help. In paragraph three is says that this technology can already identify six basic emotions and fear is one, so if more emotion are learned and recongnized then the teacher could really help solve a problem. Many possibilities could and will come with this technology.

Students could use this not only with teachers, but also with their friends. Kids tend to joke around and not realize when they are hurting someones feelings. This could allow these kids to know when too far has occured. Like almost all kids some are afraid to stand up and say that something has hurt their feelings. This new technology may help the problems with bullying. Maybe the bystanders of the bullying would see how truly upset the attacked person is feeling. Kids do a really good job at pretending things do not hurt them, but in reality they hurt them a lot. I know the article does not say anything about this but this is a huge possibility this could be used for. We want to help kids so why not do it this way.

This technology would help so much in a school. many problems occur in schools, that could potentionally be bypassed with this technology. Students and teachers could all benefit from this technology. Who is to say that if it works in a school that more advancements could come out of this new technology. We have no idea what the future holds, but this could be a big part of our future and helping us to unerstand each other a little more.

4547adf,"America was built upon the foundation known as democracy, yet we have been desecrating on what we believe in for years. I am talking about the elctoral college, the process of picking a president or senator through voting for what an elector decides on and acts as a representative for what a certain region decides to vote for. From the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the elctors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral vites by Congress."" I do not believe that the elctoral college is a wise decision as it being the process of voting for our next leader.

Many people disagree with my opinion and there are a few reasons why, that even I support. From the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president,"" by Richard A. Posner, he states that the outcome is certain when applying electoral college to a vote, while a dispute can be more likely to occur using the popular vote method. However, thye elctorial college can even decrease the percentage of voters in the country. There are Democrats in Texas while California has Republicans. This means that there are elctors who already know what they're voting for and the candidates only visit ""swing"" states or states who have no preference on what party they are voting for. This will decrease the chance of voters to vote in a state that already knows what party the electors of their state will vote for.

I agree on the basis that vote by popular election is more applicable to the situation of voting rather than by electoral college. One reason is the mess-up that occured on the presidential election voting in 2000. The problems of the electoral college is the reason why Florida screwed up and George Bush became president rather than Al Gore, who won the popular vote. Taken from the Article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer,""Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote, but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

Another reason as stated by Plumer's article,""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What would happen if there is a tie on the votes the elector gets? Would the elector simply choose one or the other or might not even vote at all. I also believe that it is unfair that each state gets the number of electors based on the population of the state. If California was Republican while Idaho could be for Democrats, then both do not have an equal value because California has more people. Overall, electoral college seems sophisticated but whatever happened to being ""plain and simple?"".

Voting through the popular vote method seems much easier and much better than voting within a certain region counts as one vote. It would be much simpler if every vote of every single person counted as it's own vote for the president, not for an elector. This makes your vote not seem that worthy and is the cause of discouragement of voting. From the Office of the Federal Register it states that, ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" There is proportional representation or statistics involved, simply who gets more takes it and it would be unfair to each person with this method.

In conclusion, the elctoral college is an out-dated process for electing a president and should be changed to whoever, wins the popular vote because deep-down, the people are the key figure in voting. With this process, you are undermining you, your state, and even your country by continuing with this absurd and unnescessary process when it could be all voted and decided, ""by the people and for the people.""            ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of the electoral college and provides some evidence to support its position.

4575e69,"Prof. Thomas Huang, Prof. Nicu Sebe and Dr. Paul Eckman have been able tro design, read and determine emotions using a computer software called Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Using this technology, they were able to make a computer generated 3-D model of the face in this world famous painting. Using the muscles that lay underneath the skin in this 3-D model, the software is able to determine the emotion of the person based off of the physical characteristics and movement of the muscles.

In using the FACS software ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored' predicted Dr. Huang"" (paragraph 6). Much like a classroom instructor, the computer and software will be able to modify the lesson and instruction to further engage and explain to the student.

However, in a classroom, it seems that teachers will rarely change lesson plans to engage their students, and will further explain only if a specific question is asked, regardless of the look of confusion of the students' faces.

Futhermore, teachers and program writers would have to code for and write many forms of the lesson to explain or engage the students before uploading it to the computer for lessons. If a student is bored or confused, the software and computer system will have to be able to 1) recognze the facial expression and 2) choose from several lesson plans to fit and better the facial expression of the student/user.

As a student, I do not find myself to be facially expressive on the computer, in fact the only expresson I have is within my mind, while my face remains blank. This would make it impossibke for the FACS to identify bordom or confusion. There is also the possiblilty of the software confusing one of these facial expressions with that of concentration when reading or writing.

The article states that "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" (Paragraph 7) If the same algorithms (FACS) would be used to determine the facial feature of Mona Lisa and her expression to aid the computer in determining the facial characteristics and emotions of a student. At our 1-on-1 technology based school, students can either rent laptops or provide their own for school work. If our personal computers cannot store the algorithms of FACS to determine the facial features of students then it would be entirely useless. The school would have to purchase entirely new computers for every student in the school, with the RAM and capacity to read emotions and contain the FACS. These computers would have to be laptops so they can be transported between classes, school and home. This would be too costly for the school or students and improbable in being able to find and provide the correct kiond of computer.

If the FACS needs to be able to computer generate a 3-D model of the face, the computer would run signifigantly slower because it is trying to read your emotions and run any other programs you have open for your class work. Unlike the Mona LIsa, our faces are already three-dimensional, however the computer software would have to be able to generate a computer model of the students face and expression by examining the muscles underneath in the model, which in all liklihood would take much longer to complete than it does for an expression to change or the comprehension of a subject ot take place.

To conclude, although the Facial Action Coding System would hypothetically work to decide emotions, it would be entirely too costly, time consuming, and unlikey in te effectivness of being able to read the expressions of students during class.",5,3.0,,":** The essay adequately develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates some critical thinking.

This shows, that if they have to go somewhere they go walking. Also the street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbiden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg.

But car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park, and is for $40,000, along with a house. And as a result , 70% of Vauban's families do not onw cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. Because when she had a car she was always tense. Also cars causes lazyness to do stuff, and it doesn't keep you healthty. For example, when you walk you stregh your body and and all the parts of your body are moving. But when you use car you sit down and sometimes that can cause a back problem.

Indeed, many experts escept public transporter serving suburbs to play much larger role in a new six year federal transpotation bills to be approved this year.

19a2117,"Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping pictures of possible landing sites for Viking 2, then it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. It seemed to be staring back at the cameras on Viking 1. These photos were taken from the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.

Viking 1 took a picture of something call a butte or mesa. They're most common in the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars. Their is one in the Snake RIver Plain in Idaho.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 rimes larger than the pixel size. If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" said Jim Garvin.

The picture actually shows is the Martian Equivalent of a butte or mesa. This landform is most common in the American west. ""It reminds me most of the MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Jim Garvin.      ",1,4.0,,":** The essay provides a clear and concise overview of the ""Face on Mars"" phenomenon, including the initial discovery by Viking 1, subsequent observations by Mars Global Surveyor, and the scientific explanation for the formation.

19fcf9f,"I think that fellow citizens should have the advantages to car usage, because not everyone would feel comfortable ridding around in a bus or a train with lots of other people . But then again you have some conflicts with the environment getting all ugly and nasty . Some people are different from others not everyone will want to go the same way meaning . They rather have their own privacy and not be on a bus or a train full of random people that might be sick with a flu or smell really nasty. Thats why 80 percent of transportation has been thruogh highways an only 20 percent to other transportation . Most of the people who intend to use train or buses don't have the right amount of money to purchase a brand new car or even a used one . The cause of that is Taxes or IRS are taking to much from the people who work to hard an theres nothing that can be done too that.

This is what I don't get about how things are being done to try an save our planet called earth . If you want to try an save some thing an make it better. Don't make a expensive invention an expect people to by it like for examlpe the hybrids or plug-in cars. People can't afford many things in life because money comes an goes without out you evening knowing it . So why try to start something new when its only making more of a mess that inventers are cuasing.

The way Bogota is going is the best idea that I've ever heard of they couldn't of nailed it any better . They stopped a capital city of 7 millon people from using their cars . An look at the good effects it did, new restaurants where opened an upscale shopping district haved cropped up .  The pitted an uneven sidewalks have been fixed an replaced by new smooth sidwalks. Even parks and sports centers haved also bloomed throughout the city, which is good because parents have more time an money to get their kids more actived in to sports an going out to play.

The last passage explanes what I've been saying less people are buying cars why invent new things . People are going unemployedment an things aren't going to get any better for our country . The governments are asking for to much plus you have taxes an the IRS right behind them waiting to grab your money that you worked hard for . Another thing that I don't get is why the President of the untied states can help other countries but yet can't even of seem to help his own country who is lossing more money as days go by . Whats going on up their in the white house we the people slecet you the president to run our country not others an help benfit us.                                                                                                                                       ",1,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue of car usage, but it is not consistently developed throughout the essay.

Many people wonder why scientist still try to find out more information about Venus. The reason is that Venus's ecosystem could have been similar to ours many years ago. Since the planet shows signs of mountains, valleys and craters we can safley assume their was once an ocean on the now uninhabitable planet. Many scientist believe that we can safley hover above Venus's atomsphere to get a better look at it.

So Luke let people from other places stay at his home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with him for the rest of his days. Like he said it was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Being a

Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky.

1b7e42c,"Alien Landform?

Do you think that the face on Mars is real or was created by an alien? As being a scientist, I dont think the face is real because Mars is not a living planet. Many of the planets in the solar system have different types of landforms in general. There is alot of evidence on how it could be many things and how it could have been made. Down below will be some evidence on how I think that the face on Mars is not real.

First, in paragraph two it said that the ""Face"" looks like a human face. ""An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Carpet Planet called Cydonia."" This could have meant that the camera was just put where the ""Face"" may have been looking at directly. there are many ways how this could just be a huge rock at a certain angle being a ""Face"".

Secondly, in paragraph 7 it states another thing about the type of landform. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . .a natural landform."" This states that there was no alien monument after all. That was another thing about how the ""face"" could have been a natural landform like how any other planet has.

Next, we all know how many people read magazines and watch movies. In paragraph 5 it states that the ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. 'It has started in a Hollywood film, apperared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" The defenders of the NASA budget wsh there was an ancient civilization on Mars. People were saying that NASA was trying to cover something up. Maybe some people dont think that its true so and that they need more information to let people know after they have found alot of information.

Now, their is a possibility that there is aliens on Mars. In paragraph 8 it claims, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face but perhaps they were alien markings that werre hidden by haze.

Driverless car so far can drive, turn, and brake, but there are still somethings that the driver would still have to do.

He fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did. During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy.

He was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian.

1e1d55f,"Dear Florida Senator,

Would you like to vote, or do you feel obligated to vote? I personally want my vote to make a difference. I would want to keep the Electoral College because it expess others to vote and to have freedom of speech of knowing which candidate would be better to control our world of which we live in.  If you are willing to vote, choose carefully and be percise with your answer. Don't let others get in your way, it's your choice and time, so express a political preference rather than deciding an election.

First of all, voting is all about the candidates, try to understand and know the candidates before voting. ""Voters sometimes get confused about the elctors and vote for the wrong candidate."" If you didn't know the candidates and voted the wrong candidate, then your vote may make a difference and you would have to wait patiently for four years intill your able to vote again for a different candidate.

Secondly, If you don't want to waste your time and thinking that your vote would not make a difference, then I'm sure others feel the same way. ""A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does."" Every state should get the equal amount of attention then any other state, and it should all be about the electors by sharing their own opinions.

Thirdly, Candidates should think about their electors and keeping this world safe and sercure for us rather than just wanting to be in the white house. ""Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" It's great that the candidates are appreciative by the electors and wanting our vote to count.

In conclusion, we cannot control electors who wants to vote for a candidate that others may dissagree on, but we can control our own vote.

It's your decision whether to vote or not and who do you approve for. Your vote can make a difference and every bit counts. So there is a reason to have the Electoral College.         ",1,3.0,,":** The essay develops a point of view on the issue of the Electoral College and provides some reasons to support its position.

my inference now is it is an alien. because, the face was located 41 degrees north martian latitude. The face seems to be in a very random spot to be seen. My inference is it is an alien. however you never know

Now i personally think it is or was an alien. the face looks very plain and in a random spot for a human to roam. the altitudes have no life on them, Mars has no life on it.

220280e,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy was one of the best times of Luke's life. He got to travel the world and explore. And he got to help people around the world.

Paragraph 3 tells us about how in August 1945, Luke received orders to go to New Orleans. He arrived Agust 14, 1945. There Luke got my seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster headed for Greece. On the ship were a 335 horse cargo with hay and oats to feed them. In paragraph 4 we learn that Luke turned 18 before he made it to Greece. This meant he was able to be drafted for military service, but his draft board said that he should just keep the service he already had. Luke was discharged in 1947, but he had made nine trips by that time, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Not only did Luke help people, but he also got to see Europe and China. Paragraph 5 tells us how Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece and how he take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a lot more than an advemture for Luke. In paragraph 9 he quotes, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.""",1,3.0,,": The essay develops a point of view that being a Seagoing Cowboy was one of the best times of Luke's life.

A new software ha sbeen develloped that improves accuracy in perciving the emotions of others. this new software, the Facial Action Coding Syste, has promising applications for variety of industries.

This technology can recognize emotions like the Leonardos da Vinci's renissance painting, Mona Lisa, she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe. The process beings when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model

of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions, happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. The facial expressionsfor each empotion are universal. By weighting the different units, the softwere can even identify mixed emotions. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For intance, you can problably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of, course most of us woulld have trouble actually describing each facial tarit. While it shows just how much this computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. Acordinng to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.

In conclusion I think that this new technology would be beneficient for the people because it would help to know better the people. Also to know about those muscular action units.

23709d9,"electrol college is not just a college it is a process,  The electoral college is a process that consist of the selection of the electors,  it started in the founding fathers established in the constitution as a comprise between election of the president . this means that the electorol college should stay this college is more than just any old college its history ,its in the constitution this college should not be gone this college should be honored. these electorals mainly select the votes for the people in the white house like the president and vice predident. our state is entitled allotment of electors equals the nuimber of memebers in the congressional delegation  . i want electoral college to stay because they are good at things for the state . and they also have a big role in alot of things.

the electors college plays a big role in our state . under the 23 amendment of the constitution , the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and a treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college . this means that because of the electoral college the district of columbia is treated like a state . so electoral college  is the reason why some districts are called a state why take this type of college away if this has such a big role in alot of things to do with the congress . with out the electoral college they wouldnt have presidents or any thing . in every election the electors are always there in every president election every president have their own group of electors behind them . they are joined by a canidates political party .

u may wonder how the electors work because all u do is see them behind the prsident well the process is hard and they want students who wants to be an elector to get ready on what they are about to get in to . it first start off by the u choosing the president when u choose the president u choose the group of electors this means when you choose the president the electors goes with him or her , most states have winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winng pesidental canidate's electors . after the election the govoner pepares a 'certificae of ascertainment'. this means that that it is listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with names of their respective electors . the electors go through a long process . and the college wants the studentsa to know all the things they need to before they become electors.

the electors deserve to have a college someone might want to be an elector and they might think its hard for them it wouldnt be anything with out electors they do more than just stand behind the president they do more they help the president the president we have today wouldnt be able to run for president without a group of electors . and they need a college for someone who wants to be an elector. this college should be honored to be in a program like that these electors are needed in our country with out electors we would have nothing if we didnt have electors the electoral college is widely know as an non democratic method of selecting a president that outa be by declaring the canidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner .

these are all the reasons why we need the electors program . because they play in a big role of our country and dthey also good for our state and .l so we need these progems to show young student that being an elector is not easy itbis very hard and a long process and we need to show students how the experience is and they also need to be knowleged trained to do stuff that will make our country better . because if they mess up  on one little thing its an automatic fire for them . we need these colleges because it plays a big role and it reuires the votes. of the president meaining it helps the president win .                                                   ",1,3.0,,":** The essay demonstrates some understanding of the electoral college and its role in the presidential election process.

247f18e,"I think that the development should happen because it can be easier to drive. Also i think it can prevent less accidents and save lives. For example, sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individial wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could ever manage alone.

Also, the development should happen because it can be very hepful. For example, In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.

My last reason to have the development is sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their on. Also antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless cab to take us take us wherever we desire.",1,3.0,,":** The essay provides a clear point of view on the issue of self-driving car development and supports it with examples.

mars globe surveyspace craft revealed the face of mars is a mesa (intro) ,scientists found it was just another martian mesa(2).

A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a “huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.” The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars(3).

on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.(7)

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001—a cloudless summer day in Cydonia—Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. “We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,” said Garvin. “Malin’s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera’s absolute maximum resolution.” Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo(10).

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa—landforms common around the American West. “It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,” says Garvin. “That’s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.”(12).therefore there is no alien life forms on other planets.

In Vauban, Germany, residents of this upscale comunnity are surburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

In Bogota, Columbua, there is a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hikes, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams.

Paris, France has enforeced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city. Diesel fuel was blamed, since diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the Western Europe.

In Bogota, Colombia they ban cars altogether. they go rid of the roads and made them into sidwalks. Now that people have to walk to get to their final destination a lot of people now go to the parks and to the sports centers that they have there.

Venus could have a lot we didn´t think it had, but no one, including myself, have ever study the planet at all. But we can now and see what lies in the planet known as Venus.

First off, Venus is one of the brightest points of light, making it simple for stargazers. Often called the Ëvening Star"" but the nickname can be misleadinng since the planet Venus is...well a planet. While also very simple to see from the distant safe advantage of Earth, it proves to be a very challenging place to examine more closer. It makes you wonder what´s even that planet to study about.

Next, Venus´ surface has their temperature average over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our planet. The planet´s conditions Venus has is way more extreme than we thought it would be that we wouldn´t be accustomed to the second we even try to get there. Beyond the high pressure and the heat, Venusian geology and weather present some impediments like volcanoes that can erupt, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to seek land onto its surface. No wonder why Venus is fascinatiing in some people´s eyes.

Lastly, going over to Venus with a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only have a limit insight on ground conditions since most of the forms can´t penetrate the dense atmosphere. It´s important to know that researchers cannot take samples of any rock, grass, or anything else in the distance.

I said,""I am very sorry to hear that, but i have something to offer you, by the way how old are you?"" He said, ""I am 19 years old, but what is this offer you are giving me?"" I said, ""Ok thats good, I am a Seagoing Coybow, we are looking for people that want to help others in Europe by giving them what they need."" He said, ""No way, i've been trying to join the program but I missed the singups, im in, also my name is Gavin!""

I said, ""Glad to hear!"" I also said, ""Do you have any friends or family that want to join the program?"" He said, ""I don't know, hmm, maybe my friend Ben?"" I said, ""Great, do you think you can go on my ride and go to his house if he is home?"" He said, ""Yes, he is home right now!"" I said,""How old is he?"" He said, ""He is 23 years old, met him at my job, we were both fighting over something, but we became friends!""

We both rode in my wagon. We made it to his house. I knocked on the door three times no answer. Then when Gavin knocked on the door in a wierd sort of pattern we could hear footsteps. Ben came down he looked big and strong.

I asked him,""Hey Ben, I have met your friend Gavin today, he is going to be joining the Seagoing Coybows program, are you interested in joining?"" He said, ""No sounds dumb."" I said, ""How is it dumb to help people in need?"" He said, ""I don't wanna help just like I said the first time and I don't care! Ben's mom came downstairs.

She yelled, ""Who is it and what do you want with me and my son!"" I said, ""We are just seeing if he is interested in joining a program!"" She ran downstairs and now we saw her. She was tall and had blue eyes with blonde hair. She said, ""What type of program?"" I said, ""The Seagoing Coybows program, I have made 9 trips across the oceans, the most any Seagoing Coybow has, I was recruited in it in 1945 and it is an amzing job, I have been on many amazing adventures and got to visit cool places, you also help people in need!"" She said the same thing that Ben said.

She said, ""There is no point in doing it!"" I said, ""How is it bad to help people in need?"" She said, ""Why should I care?"" Ben said, ""I know right?"" I said, ""What if you were that person in need and needed food,supplies, and transportation?"" ""Wouldn't you want help? She said, ""I guess your right, son you should sing up seems like a great offer to travel places and help people."" Ben said, ""That's dumb, I don't care about them, I care about me, look I need a haircut and you want me to help people instead that I don't care about at all?""

I said,""I will pay for your haircut and it is an amazing offer just like your mom said!"" He said, ""What would you do in the boats?"" I said, ""You would feed and water the animals, but there is also fun things to do like play volleyball,ping pong,fencing,boxing,and reading!"" He said, ""Sounds good I guess I will join!"" I said, ""Ok great!"" We all left the small town and got on the boats. It was going to be a great adventure!

""car reduced""

communities. Only 12% of gas emissions in Europe are caused by passenger cars.

People in France enforced a partial driving ban for a while just to clear the air of the city. People of that city where demanded to leave their cars at home if they had a license plate with even-numbers. If they disobeyed they had to pay a 31$ fine. Of course the following day it applied to people with odd-numbered license plate. The traffic went down 60% after 5 days of intense smog. Paris usually has more smog than othe European capitals.

BOGOTA, Colombia is where the car-free day was held. Many citezens participated in this event to limit car usage to reduce city smog. Violators faced a 25$ fine. But it was a pretty successful day despite the fact that is was raining, it didn't really stop anyone from not using their cars. The campaign tin Bogota began in the mid-1990s. More than one colombian city has joined this event

Cali and

Valledupar.

A

s of april 2013, the number of car usage per person has gone down nearly 9% lower than the point almost close to where the country was in January 1995 in the United States. And the numbers keep dropping down steadily as a study last year found that driving done by young citizens has been decreasing by 23% between 2001 - 2009.

Mona Lisa is in the picture, she 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. At some schools there are some computers sofware that can recognize emotions but not all of them. Dr. Huang is terying to find better ways for humans and computers to communicate. they are suing alot of techology to find how are people emotions in the picture. I know when people lok at a picture people wanna know how are that person is feeling in that picture.

Dr. Huang is putting the computer constructs in 3D and trying to put 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions like happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. when your in a picture your going to have some type of face expression. It all depends on what type of face that the person in the picture is looking like. Even your mouth can depend if your face expression is good or bad by tighting your lips to show anger.

When your round people you can tell their face expression just by the look of their face. A lot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy. And their face expressions can depend on how their hair looks. If their hair looks all over the place its probably bad and if their hair looks all nice its probably happy.

My conclusion is to find someone feelsing is look ing at their face and their hai and how their face looks. Just like actors be doing reproduce smilling and frowning. Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.

4b96296,"I am for driverless cars, because they could be helpful, they seem safe, and they are already being used by Google. They could help people with disabilities that make them unable to drive or go where they need to go.

First of all, they are using sensors in them to help navigate them. They are developing special roads, smart roads. There were test tracks built in the 1950's by General motors. They built a concept car that could run on a special track that was embedded with a electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineers at Berkeley tried something similar. They used magnets with alternating polarity, so the car could read the polarities using the binary code. All of this was proved to be too expensive. They started putting sensors on the cars, postion-estimating sensors, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor.

Second of all, they seemed far away from making a driverless car. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assiatant."" The car would be able to handle driving at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors makes sure the drivers keeps ahold of the wheel. Most of these cars are yet to be fully driverless, they can steer, accelerate, and brake on their own, but they all are designed to notify the driver when the rooad ahead requires human skills. Some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays would be turned off instantly when the driver needsto take over, this way the in-car system is acctually a safety feature.

Third of all, The only problem is that there are laws prohibiting the uses and testing of driverless cars. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all time. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe. Traffic laws will have to change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. Automakers are still continuing with their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.

Therefore I am for driverless cars, because they could be helpful, they seem safe, and they are already being used by Google. There's no telling what's to come from the future of driverless cars. ",1,4.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 4**

0742654,"Kids across America probably know someone who looks or acts like they are depressed, but when they ask what is wrong they usually say they are fine or nothing is wrong and they will try to continue their day. Having a Facial Action Coding System inside of schools would benefit many schools and people. If schools had this and staff heard about a kid who is not looking mentally well they can have the kid go through the system and if anything is wrong they could give the kid the help he or she needs.

The child will not be able to slide past the system with a fake smile either because in paragraph 7 the FACS can detect the difference between a forced smile and a genuine smile making it harder for you to slip passed the system. The FACS does not always have to be used to see if a child feels bad and needs help. In paragraph 6 Dr. Haung says that if a child was on a computer the computer could recognize if the student was confused or bored. This could benefit kids greatly because sometimes kids are afraid to ask questions in front of the class, but if this was set up to where the teachers were alerted when a kid was confused the teacher could just walk over to the child and ask what they were confused about and asses the problem right where the kid is sitting.

In conclusion having the FACS in schools would benefit kids and teachers greatly because they could see how their students are feeling and if they are confused in anyway, and they could see what the problem is and how they could fix it whenever they need to.

18d261d,"In Vauban, Germany, the citizens are not allowed to own cars and if they do, they're parked on outskirts of the city or in garages at the end of their developments. The citizens walk and bike ride places, and they refrain from using their vehicle as much as possible. Overall, people are happier. They're getting more exercise and are being able to enjoy the outdoors and communicate with eachother more than if you were passing your neighbor in your car. It leaves the streets safer for the children and creates a more family-centered environment that the rest of Europe is starting to experiment.

Maybe your idea of a family centered area is one of spread out houses with private garages and cars but we can also create that by doing away with vehicles and removing them from our environment.

In Paris, vehicles were banned for a period of time because the of smog content in the city. If citizens did not comply to this order they were to be fined and your vehicle could be impounded. The increase use of motorized vehicles by mass pollutes cities and makes it unsafe to breath the air. Hybrids, plug in cars, and vehicles transporting 3 or more people were excused from this sudden crack-down on automobile use, but after a few days the French government allowed it to return to the normal use of all vehicles.

In Bogota, Columbia, no-car days are being experimented with. The citizens have been every enthusiatic in participating and overall it has been a huge opportunity for people to get out and enjoy the city on foot, on bikes, or in buses or taxis. Other cities surrounding Bogota joined in the event this year and also enforced fines upon anyone who did not comply to the rule.

Well now you can with the all new Facial Action Coding System. It's a system that can figure out the emotions that you are feeling just from your facial expressions.

I feel as if this could help in the classroom but not as much as Dr. Huang thinks. I think that yes it would help with making class less boring and/ or confusing but it can also just lead to even more frustation or sadness. It also isn't going to help if you are sitting in front of an actual human teacher and not a computer.

200d3eb,"Emotions may be hard to understand sometimes, but they are still vital in everyday life so that we as humans can communicate how we are feeling with each other. It is especially vital for teachers to know how their students are enjoying the lesson. With modern technology that can read emotions, teachers may be able to better understand their students, and create a lesson that is fun for everyone.

From an emotion test taken on the Mona Lisa, Professors Thomas Huang, and Nicu Sebe detected the lady's exact emotions based on what is portrayed in the painting. According to the technology, she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfuk, and 2 percent angry."" This technology used on a classic Renaissance painting could be used in schools to help teachers better understand the students, and therefore help to make the class fun for every one. In the article it gives the example of a class room computer recognizing when a student is bored or confused, then modify the lesson to fit that person's personality.

All in all, this sort of technology that can read emotions would be helpful for schools because it could help students understand their school work better, and in turn help them do better in school.

2107217,"Saving The World, One Car At A Time

In country like Germany,Paris, and Colombia, they limit the use of cars due to carbon emission. I think that this is a great idea. Limiting car usage means less pollination, which would benefit us greatly.

Though ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Robert Duffer's article, the""congestion was down 60 percent. You can't tell me that is not remarkable.

We could just take a day and walk or ride our bicycle to work/school, and  make a difference, so let's try.

450420e,"Limiting car use is not a new idea. It has been around for about 10 years now, but there has been a major spike in car usage and carbon-based emissions. Less and less people are using a car, and car sales have also gone in a downward spiral. Company chairman for Ford, Bill Ford, proposed a buisness plan for cities that have no practical use at the Mobile World Congress in Spain. Since even before the recession, less and less people are obtaining their licenses, and there has been an increase in major city populations, where driving is severly discouraged. Changes like these are leading to lower emisssions, improved saftey, conserved resources, and saved time, according to Ford.

Between 2001 and 2009, there was about a 23 percent drop in young people getting their license. These numbers are inspiring cities all over the world to make a change and do their part to make a change in the world. The capital of Columbia, Bogata has something known as a ""car-free day,"" where only busses and taxis are permitted to be on the road. Other drivers will face a $25 fine. Even in the rain people continued to not use their car. Two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, also joined in for the first time this year. Bogota has a population of around seven million people, so even if they stop just a quarter of them from driving, then that could cut down on a lot of carbon-based emissions. In Paris, France, drivers were given 22-euro fines for even numbered license plates on one day, then odd numbered license plates the next. Congestion was down 60 percent, and this was after five days that Paris' emissions could rival those of major cities in China. France's tax policy that makes diesel fuel more viable than gasoline was partially to blame, according to Reuters. Diesel engines make up 67 percent of cars in France, which is much higher than their European counterparts. Compared to other captials, Paris has a much higher particulate matter as well. It had over 30 more micrograms than the next highest, which is Brussels, mostly due to the cold nights and warm days, which would trap carbon. After the smog was cleared, Paris released the ban on certain numbered license plates.

Another advantage to having no cars is that we have more people walking or riding their bike. While obesity rates in America have been turned around and are trending in the right direction again, there is always more that can be done. It will get people to be more active, and maybe try to eat healthier so they have more energy to walk to where they are going. There will always be obese people, especially in developed countries where junk food is sold around every corner. But we help those who want to change and be healthier by giving alternative choices instead of sitting while commuting. Of course, it would be ridiculous for somebody to have to walk 10 miles to get to work. Not everything can be perfect. Suburban towns would likely fade out of existance, making large cities larger and more intemit. Cars will never fully vanish. But you can do your part. The next time you have to go to the store that's withing walking distance, take a bottle of water and head out. Greenhouse gasses could be stopped, and it all starts with you.                                                             ",2,4.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue of limiting car use and demonstrates competent critical thinking.

Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district and Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.

Vauban serves as a great example on how the majority of world should be. The time to take action is now.

48c70fe,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents adequately well. The author uses factual information and describes some of the reasons why studying Venus would be rewarding. The author states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" in paragraph 4. By including the information from the quote above, the author allows the reader to understand why studying Venus would be beneficial and crucial for further planetary study. The author also states a feasible idea that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) thought of for studying Venus in the following quote ""The National Aeronatics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particular idea for sending humans to study Venus."" in Paragraph 5. The author then continues to explain the idea, which can be possibly sucessful and would allow for Venus to be studied. Through the explanation of this idea, the author shows that despite the dangers presented Venus can still be studied safely. The author concludes the article with the following quote ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" from paragraph 8. This statement is tenaciously powerful in that it empowers the reader to not be afraid of the dangers and doubts presented by studying Venus, but rather be inspired to think of solutions to overcome the said dangers and doubts. All in all, because of the factual information and examples of ways to study Venus, the author argued the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well.",2,5.0,,":** The essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates strong critical thinking.

They're part of our culture, so deeply engrained that we buy our homes and plan our lives around the commutes we use to go about our lives but recently, cities around the world have been questioning our dependance and need for cars, especially considering the damage they do to our environment. However, the environment doesn't concern the man or woman that is trying to get to work, so what are the other benefits of not having a car? Well, closer locations, a peaceful life style and a close knit community are also elements that come with a world where cars aren't the norm.

For those who think practically, not having a car is a hassel but the thing is that cities that have already implemented this change. Locations are put closer together so that you may only need a car to get to the next city and even then alternate transportations are put in place to help with that. For example Vauban, Germany has completely given up their cars, except for a few placed in choice parking spaces at the edges of the town.

Having a driveless care shouldnt be aloud at all. first they could increase the the rate for czr crashes in teens. the rate is already high for them expecially in Indiana and we dont even have them kind of cars yet. Cell phones are a major role to the youth in todays time. that is the main reason for so many recks today so if you give them a car that can drive its self, they are not gone do nothing but text and not pay attention to the rode at all basically if you was to do that you are setting them up fro their own death.

Second ,by not creating these kinds of car and giving them out you could be saving your company alot of money. Because if somebody was to get in a reck and they wasnt driving but the car was driving its self they gone come to the people who made the car because they feel like it was thier fault. Even tho you told them that they still had to pay attention to the rode they not cuz they feel like the car can watch its self. so if you dont put the car on the market you can save your company alont of money and alot of stress.

Third, you wouldnt wanna be the reason for any deaths, because if you start getting so many deaths on your car nobody is going to want your car so now you then wasted money on all these cars and parts for these cars that nobody is buying so you just lost alot of money and nobobody just has money to waste. If your company starts to lose money they gone have to start cutting people because they can no longer pay you, and the first person they are going to fire are the people who came up with the idea that caused them to lose so much money in conslusion i think t would be your best bet to just not make the cars because your saving money, your saving lives so now your heros, and you dont have to worry about anybody tryong to sue you for most of everything yall got because if the person win boy yall feelings gone be hurt ",3,1.0,,": The essay fails to develop a clear and coherent point of view on the issue of driverless cars.

47ccf06,"Cars produce the second highest amount of greenhouse gas in the United States, being 50% of the gas production in some car-intensive areas. This wreaks havoc on our atmosphere, irreversibly damaging it. However, in recent years, car usage and in turn the amount of gases produced by them has gone down. Many places are beginning to follow the trend ""smart planning"": carpooling, taking public transport, or even just biking and walking instead of taking your own car to work every day. This trend is incredibly advantageous, as it reduces gas emissions and benefits our health.

First is the reduction of greenhouse gases produced by cars. Car-intensive areas have a much higher amount of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter than areas which are starting to use smart planning. For example, Paris has an average of 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter, while London, which has started to use smart planning, has an average of 79.7 micrograms of PM per cubic meter; nearly half that of Paris. This reduction in gases shown by the trend is good for our atmosphere, and good for us.

Preventing us from choking on the smog produced by our vehicles is not the only health benefit that smart planning is providing. Instead of sitting cramped in a car with the only movement being pushing a pedal, people are out walking and biking and getting fresh air. This is not only a physical benefit but also a mental one, as many people have reported that they feel less stressed without the use of cars, such as Heidrun Walter, a citizen of car-free Vauban, Germany. Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

The obvious beneficial properties of smart planning have begun to make it very popular, as Vauban is not the only place choosing to use less motor vehicles. Paris now hands out a fine to every motorist with an even-numbered license plate on one day, and any vehicle with an odd-numbered plate the next. Bogota, Colombia has an annual holiday where anyone using a personal motor vehicle will be fined 25$. Despite rain, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, and skated their way to work this year. Even the U.S. President Barack Obama is trying to curb the nation's gas emissions. Many people in America are already using less cars. With the public transportation system and a large number of people carpooling, the use of cars is steadily dropping. The number of miles driven per person peaked in 2005, and has steadily dropped since. In 2013, it had dropped nearly 9%, the lowest it had been since 1995. Driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009, and there has also been a large decrease in the number of Americans ages 16-39 getting their licenses.

In conclusion, smart planning is incredibly beneficial to the world, and to us. Already emminently popular, it reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in the air by a significant amount, as well as causing some people to walk and bike, promoting excersize and reducing obesity. Smart planning is an amazing benefit to us as people and as citizens of the Earth, and it will only get more popular as time goes on.    ",3,5.0,,,,"**Holistic Score: 5**

0946813,"Driverless Cars

Creating driverless cars in the world seems like a big deal today. In all reality, having driverless cars around the world can be an accident just waiting to happen. If you really think about it, teenagers would most likely be the main ones buying driverless cars. Drinking while driving, texting, and falling asleep may accur when entering a driverless car. Is creating a car that drives on it's own really worth costing a life?

Drinking when driving is a huge mistake people tend to make. Giving them a car that works on its own, and allows you to sit there and get more drunk is not a very bright idea. ""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If you are drunk and the car alerts you to take control you may not even respond.

Texting and driving happens with anyone and everyone. People are way too focused on seeing what their friend sent them instead of paying attetion to the road. Alot of collisions have happend because of one driver texting and driving. "" Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters they need a whole lot of sensors."" Say those sensors just happend to suddenly cut off and not give any warning. How will a person know when to look up from their addictive phone?

Working hard days 24/7 can make a person extreamly sleepy. Say you get off of work and your exhausted, and a peaceful song comes on the radio. While listening to that song you fall into a deep sleep while your car takes you back to your house. ""Their cars have driven more than half a mile without a crash."" Maybe the test cars didn't have a problem with the driverless cars but what if somthing breaks in your car and it loses control? The sleepy driver is in deep sleep and could die from the driverless car manufacturing.

In conclusion, having a driverless car does not make the world any safer nor better. It gives people a better chance to drink and drive, text and drive, even sleep and drive. How is making driverless cars anysafer yet better to the world?

In all reality, it makes it more dangerous. ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument against driverless cars.

People who believe it is created by aliens suely hasn't seen all the evidence behind ""The Face.""

First of all, when people saw the face in 1976 they couldnt have had o believe an aliens as making it. How could have there have been a person on Cydonia or an alien. That is why they went back to Mars to prove some scientists' theories wrong. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor had flew over Cydonia for the first time. The surveyor had a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Some people were not satisfied because it was cloudy on the Red Planet. They said that the alien marking were hidden by blaze. Compaing the picture of 1998, it certailey looks more like a regular rock on a surface. They went back four years later on a less cloudy day to still prove the believers wrong.

On a cloudless day the Mars Global Surveyor took away a piece of evidence of aliens in space. On April 8, 2001, four years later than the last visit to Cydonia, the surveyor captured the photo much better than all pictures and proved tha the face was a natural platform. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in he best 1976 Viking photo. The photos were astonishing and made the face be un masked.

Jim Garvin, a chief scientist, said that ""It reminds me most pf Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the ame height as the Face on Mars."" They are comaparing it to landforms on Earth! How much more evidence can you ask for.

The face on mars has been a fraud for being an alien landform. All the evidenc shos all the people and my friend that the ""Face"" is not real and just a landform accordin to a ver clear picture and an explanation from Jim Garvin.",4,2.0,,":**

18f9457,"Things in life has changed over the years 2018 is a whole new year with many things different then the 1980s for sure. In the past there was no phones or laptops. Now in the present almost everyday something comes out new. There is always a new software here and there. I do not find that a ""Facial Action Coding System"" is valuable for kids in the classroom.

I do not think that it is valuable for kids in the classroom. I do not think that it is valuable because if kids do not understand they will have a confused look on their face. They will also be the ones to ask questions about what they are confused on. Kids have many emotions but I do not think that it will be able to be hard to tell if they are struggling or not.

They said in the passage that it is a painting ""It's the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa."" Also in one of the paragraphs below it says that the human face has to have all 44 muscles in the face to be able to show if they are happy, sad, digusted, etc. In the painting how could there be 44 muscles is the real question. You can not paint 44 muscles in all the right spots when not everyones face is the same shape. Having the same size shape of the face and testing people I can see why they would say that you would be happy or sad. This is a painting and there is probably not a single person with the same face as Mona Lisa.

The ""3-D"" computer model could possibly show all 44 musles in the face but that would be a lot of face scanning because like I said before in my last sentence there could not possibly be someone with the same face shape. How can they test multiple people when those people could have the muscles all over there face. There is simple ones like the ""frontalis pars lateralis muscle"" which is above your eyes and the ""orbicularis oris"" which is around the mouth. that is only 2 out of the 44 muscles that they have to scan on a persons face.

If they wanted to test multiple people that would have to have someone who actually knows where all of the muscles are. In the right stop because if you guess the spots the mood can be wrong. I do not find that it should be used on anyone. Human communication is when two or more people talk together. That is one of the most simplest ways to find out if the kids in your classroom does not understand what you are going over with them. Emotional communication is when someone lets out all of the emotions that they have and will show them becasue they will either be mad with a grumpy face on or they will be upset and not smile at all.

I came up with that it is not valuable for kids in the classrooom because I do not understand why there would have to be a software out when the student could just ask a question in class or even ask after class. There's many other things to do then to have to scan the face and have someone point all of their facial muscles out to find out how they feel. Plus there are multiple kids in the classroom that you would have to scan and not everyone has the same facial structure that would be many times pointing out every single facial muscle and finding out how they feel when there are simpler ways to figure it out.

19676b0,"I present negative aspects of driverless cars becasue they can be dangerous when your driving them. We should't have driverless cars because anything could happen when your driving them. Even though they can drive under specific conditons you always have to be alert.

""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If the car can drive by its self I think it should be able to get threw roadwork by its self. Anything can happen when the driver is not paying attention to the road. The driver can accidently fall asleep or be on the phone and swerve right off the road. People are really fascinated with driverless cars but its not the better chioce when it comes to safety. The car can alert you to late and you wouldn't have a chance to take control fast enough.

However I think you should pay attention to the roads at all times.""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" I don't think thats true becasue anything could happen with the car, with a human i think they have a better response on stopping the car with the brakes. ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. If anything happens to the people i think the maunfacturer

should have full responablity because, why have driverless car anyways.?

""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" I don't think they should sell those and I hope nobody buys them. Because its useless to have a driverless car that you still have to be alert to. If its that good the car should alert it self when at risk of anything. ""Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.""

Its illegal in some states to even test computer-driven cars but in my opioin I think it should be in all states.

1a14e33,"Have you ever wondered about how cars would be upgraded ? Just like phones are being upgraded each year, becoming greater that people love it. After reading the article of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", I do not think that upgrading our cars in the future would be nessary for people. The reason why is because it could have a negative impact on us. It can also cause death, change of law , and change of rules the way people are driving.

In paragraph 1, Sergery Brin says that he envisions a future where there would be public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public tranport taxi system. He also says that the car would use half a fuel of todays taxis and would offer more flexibility than a bus.He believes thats such cars would fundamentally change the world. But as for me, I do not believe that it will change the world. People will face consequence, death, and danger if cars like this are invented.

In paragraph 7, it says that cars are designed to notify drivers when the road ahead of us requires human skills, suck as navigating through work zones and around accident. If the car was invented,how would we be able to turn away from accidents and work zone? If something happened while inside the car, we would just be dead.Inventing this car will bring death,

desruption and war to the world.

People do not want desruption,death, and war, they want peace and if this car is invented we will have to face danger.

In paragraph 8, it says that in-car system is actually a safety feature and that safety is a big concern. If the car is invented there won't be any safety. The reason why is if there were no stop light, and signs how are we going to know what the rules are?To change the rule and the law , the goverment would have to change everything that they have worked on for many years.They would have to make new rules and new laws.It will just bring choas to the goverment and to the people.

In conclusion, having a car being invented without a driver would be a bad idea for the future. The reason why is because it could cause death, consequence,change, and desruption to the people and to the world.The cars will not secured us, or give us safety, it will danger us and kill us.We should be happy right now with all the rules and the laws because it keeps us safe from dieing and accidents.People will died twice more than people dieing now.Inventing the car is a bad choice for everyone.

1bb4235,"Splash, splash, splash what do you think of that sound every night just before you go to bed. This is what the Seagiong Cowboys hear every night. Caring for animals all day on a boyt can be very hard work, but it is alway fun and intergetic work. It is the most exciting adventure you could ever do in your life time, so just try it. When I first heard about the trip it was like th emost amazing thing ever.

Never before in my life had anything seemed so great. The trip wass fantastic, just all the scenery and things you saw. You get to meet and be with other Cowboys. You learn to trust and like to be with animals. It just so I would really advise you to at least try it and see how you like it at sea for so long.

You get pulled in right away whoever you are old or young. There are games such as table-tennis tournaments,fencing, boxing, and the cowboys also play baseball and volleyball in the stalls where there aren't any animals in. You could also read, or wittle to help pass the times when you didn't have anything to do. You aso have a lot of oppertunities to do diferent jobs aound the bout.

When I was on my second round giong along with the Seagiong Cowboys I surved as a night watchman. When you get this job you have to go around every hour and check on the animsls and see if they are all right. While diong this I slipped and fell which was a scarey thing because I wa sheaded strait for the edge of the bout. Lucky me I was caught and only had a brocken rib.

You can also become a very well know person if you do oit right. I am so thankful I went to help, as I said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" I have helped so many international students and and exchange visitors for years. This trip has made my life such a bliss since I agreed to sign up for that trip to take care of the animals while they get shipped across the ocean from place to place and to time.

As I have been telling you just try to and juust see how you like it. When I came oout of high school I was working two part- time jobs and had a best freind named Don Reist. When he came up to me and askekd me if I would do it I couldn't say no. I knew this would be my only chance in a life time. So why don't you try this, or if you don't like it tey something else. Just just do what your heart tells you to do, and be happy.  ",4,2.0,,":**

* **Critical thinking:** The essay lacks critical thinking. The writer does not provide any evidence to support their claims about the benefits of working as a Seagoing Cowboy.

1ca2b1e,"I believe this idea of having self driving cars is not a good idea because, you have to be alert at all times while in this type of car, human skill is going to be needed at times while in these cars and because, its just simpliy a watse of time and money on the manufactuar´s part.

In the story it talks about how self driving cars will change the world and all but, as I see it its all still the same as if you drove the car yourself. In paragraph two it clearly stats that the passanger in self driving cars still has to stay alert at all time just incase complicated traffic issuses are happining. What good does having a self driving car if you have to be alert with it as if you were driving the car yourself.

On top of having to be alert at all times while in these cars. You as a passanger will be needed during complicated traffic issues and roadwork or accidents. I understand that these cars can only do so much as far as tachnology goes but, as I see it they really are not changing anything. In paragraph 7 it tells the reader that self driving cars can function up to speeds at 25 miles per hour but, what about if you are on a highway where cars usually have to go around 40 miles per hour what will the car do then? Its pointless to continue with this research because, the things that the driver would want these self driving cars to do are not able to be done with these cars. Just an example is most human drivers have hard curves and turns while driving self driving cars are not able to do this. This is why its just a waste of time and money.

My last reason why I believe self driving cars are not worth the effort is because of the time and money that is being wasted with these cars. The story clearly states that they have been working with self driving cars since 2009. Its been 7 years in this process of making what is being called a driverless car and to be

honest with you I am not seeing enough pros in this research to want to be on their side on wanting to develople self driving cars. On top of them being in this procees for 7 years I can not imagine the amount of money companies are wasteing with this process. I can promise that test drives for these types of cars are not cheap and in paragraph two is says that they have drivin more than half of a million miles with this self driving car. the only pro to that is that it has all been without accedent.

Who knows maybe in the future they will accomplish making a well developed self driving car but, as I said I do not believe this is a good idea. Much more can be said with the proper imformation but, in the long run companies are just wasteing their time and money in making something that will take years and years to perfect and by then what good will it do. One mistake with the car malfunctioning and all their time work and money will be down the drain.  ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument against self-driving cars.

1cf2302,"Freedom to chose our leader is nothing more than an illusion. Voters have absolutely no saying in who shall take their place on the presidential seat. This is what the Electoral College does. It is an archaic system and unreliable system in which the whole of the presidential election is decided by the bias of the few whom are ""pledged"" to a certain party but at the end can choose whover the like the most. This is not the Democracy we so dearly hold in our hearts like Americans and it goes well against the principles our forefathers taught us as free pople. Undeniably the Electoral College negates any concept of the demcracy of America, making the impotance of the will of the people meaningless and nothing more than an illusion.

Deep into our history is the recaunting of how such a terrible system as the Electoral College came to be. It was originally a setllement on the dispute of how the president should be ellected, either by the people or by Congress. Now the first option would have been the perfect one, but there are always those who would firts dei to loose their power to the pople of our contry. And the clash of interrest was so large it could have broken the nation in two as we have seen happened a few times in hidstory. As such a great many years have pased since this whole argument and at every election poeple are realizing the faults of this flawed concept. At its core the system is

Old and

Useless . It is the most anti-democratic idea ever to have been in practice abd one that still is in use. It overpowers the will of millions whith the will of a few hundred. That is why such a monster should be abolished.

The year is 2000. Al Gore and George W. Bush clash for the seat in the white house. The election draws to an end and the votes are counted. There is a clear dicrepancy in the votes, making Al Gore the winner, and by all means, the next president of the United States of America. But somewhere else there's also a clear discrpancy. Back at the Electoral College the counting says Bush won against Al Gore even though Al had already won the poeple of America. On that election 5 pople choose the fate of an entire nation. 5 people only. Such a thing is outrageous, and we are lucky it hasn't happened again nor more frequently. But thing is it shouldn't happen at all. That's ehy the POEPLE should choose insted of 538 what's-their-faces. This endevour proves one thing and one thing only.

Unreliability . It is illogical that one wins the masses of the common citizens but looses because of five well dressed ones.

1d21cf1,"I think driverless car would be a bad investment for car manufacturers. I think this way because driverless cars could caused more accidents, they aren't a hundred percent driverless, and you don't know that it will be efficient or not.

Driverless cars have sensors in them that apply force when there is danger but how can you be for certain that something won't block a specific necessity of the sensor and make the sensor invalid to apply force. If the sensor didn't detect a sign of danger when there was a pedistrian or wall or car in front of them. The cars sensors would not be able to automaticly brake. Some driverless cars also have cameras in them. How do we know that what the camera sees won't mistake it with a different action. The sensor on the roof updates the car with a 3-D image of its surroundings. This 3-D imaging could pick something up that is different than what it makes or it could make the thing it saw and apply force when they needn't be any.

The cars still need a little help from the humans when there is a road block, jam in traffic,work zones, or accidents. The car doesn't have the skills yet to navigate around things that can be in the way of the road or its course it was on. The driver will be alerted when the car has a difficulty and can't manage to reroute. These cars can handle only twenty-five MPH. Higher than that the driver itself will have to drive such like on a highway when you can go 60 to 70 MPH. Manufacturers have applied different kinds of alerts such as a vibrating seat, announcing itself, and another option could be flashing lights on the windshield. How do we know if those alerts will actually alert us. Everyone is difeferent and get alerted differently, how will the manufacturers know that any of these alerts will actually be affective to people.

So could driverless cars be effecient? They could in a sense, but most information about these cars and technology could be doubtful and guesses. All technology has its flaws and bugs that no one can fix. These driverless cars could mess up or brake whenever and the humans in the car would not know. Then their life would be in danger. Driverless cars have to much new technology that they can't be reliable.

Driverless cars have a lot more to work on before it's time to come out to drivers. Manufacturers should focus on accident prone cars, a hundred percent drivable, and if it will be efficient in todays society.

1e26ea8,"I am against driverless cars. I feel this way because they will cost to much, there would be loss in jobs in the bmv, and if it cant get around roadblocks then why whould they be a good option.

Firstly the cost of driverless cars would be greater than normal cars now with all of the maitenence and the cost of aquaring the car. If something were to go wrong you would need to go to someone who specilizes in those types of cars. All of the high-tech gadgets in the car would cost way to much to replace. ot only the cost but what about the people who make a living off of making normal cars.

Secondly there are millions of people around the world that rely on making, and maintaning cars that would be put out of enployment because they wouldn't know how to get all of the gear into the car let alone up keeping them. Also people who make a living on making sure people know how to drive a car would be or of a job because no one would be interested in driving the would just let the car do it for them. The cars wouldn't be able to manuver around rodeblocks and accidents so whats the use for a car that doesn't know how to manuver around natural events.

Finaly natural occurences will happen and us as motorisses would need to know how to manuver around them. Imagen you're driving down a country road

at night when all of the sudden boom a deer walks out onto the road; its already

hard enough to avoid a deer when us as people are driving and even then we reduse our speed greatly when it happens so if we were to hit that deer the inpact wouldn't be that dangorous. What would the car do keep going at the same speed? If it does that one dear could kill who knows how many people in the car along with destroying the tech that comes along with it. Another situation would be what if there is a natural disaster like a hurricane and the city or town is evacuating; now lets say that there was a crash along the way and the cars don't know how to get around it, but nether do the people driving because they have relied on the cars to do the driving; no one would be able to escape the city before the hurricane because they had developed a relience on the cars.

These reasons are why I personaly thing that driverless cars should be kept in hollywood and in books because: the cost would be to high, jobs would be lost in manufactoring and upkeeping of the cars, and if the cars couldn't get around an accident or construction what good would it be.",4,2.0,,": The essay presents a clear point of view against driverless cars, but the development of this point of view is weak.

1e8c487,"Dont you think that having driveless cars will cause many problems? For instance driveless cars would be like schools that dont teach. Teachers would be there but they wouldnt do anything but sit there. Therefore no student would learn. So i dont think that it is a good idea to have driveless cars.

One reason i dont think that there should be driveless cars is because it would cause problems with the manufacture of the car and the owner of the car. I say that because in the passage it states that "" maufactures are aslo considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road."" That is invasion of privacy. Therfore the company and the maufacture of the car can be sued. And im pretty sure that no company would want to gert sued for having cameras on the inside of a car that watched the driver.

Another reason why i feel that there should not be driveless cars is because cars would no longer be fun for people to have. By that i mean most people like to divr they say its fun and it gives the something to do. But if there was driveless cars they wouldnt get to drive. They would just sit in the car and wait untill the car gets to the destination. So how is that fun? It would only be fun if there was a button or a switch that the owner could use to change the cars settings so that when they want to drive they can sand when they dont want to drive they dont have to.

The last reason i dont feel that driveless cars are a good idea is because there is no promises yet that there will ever be a driveless car. For example if a person is looking to buy a car and they go to a car dealership and the person trying to sell them a car says it drives on its own and the person buys the car. When they get to drive it they see that it only drives on its own at certain times. Dont you think that is real misleading? I mean there is no way that a company cant get sued for that. I say that because the company sold a car to someone that was suppose to ""drive by itself"" but it doesnt drive on its own therfore it is misleading and can cause major problems for the company.

And those are only some of the reasons on why i feel that there should not be driveless cars. They will cause to many problems with car companies and the owners of the cars. They will take all of the fun out of being able to drive cars. And if there is no promise that the car will be completly driveless and a company says it is then it could cause companies to loose a lot of money. So for everyone that thinks they should make a car that is driveless dont do it.",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument against driveless cars.

1ed10fe,"I think Venus not is a worthy pursuit because of the dangers. Venus is too hot for human to live on it's too close to the sun. The atmosphere of Venus it too thin it lets too much heat into the planet. We wont be able to survive. How do you now we will have enogh oxygen on venus to live.

First, the planet Venus it toohot for human life to survive. Venus is the second plantes from the sun it's too close to the sun for us to even try to make it there. Also no one knows how long it will take us to get to Venus wonder if the spacecraft run's out of oxygen. If it run's out of oxygen everyone will die before theyy make it to Venus, but wonder if they do make it to Venus it might not be a lot of oxygen to breathe in because the planet is so hot. Then wonder if there no water you need water to survive ecause Earth is a liquid based planet,but Venus is not.

Secondly, how do we no if the spacecraft will be able to take that type of heat. The palnet surface temperatures on Venus average over 800 degrees fahrenheit I know that's way too hot. That type of temperature is beyond of what I can imagine I know Earth's surface is hot, but not that hot. Venus atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide I think it's like that, because it's so close the sun. The closer you get to the sun the more radiant energy it gives off and too much radiant energy can be bad. Like how do we know that the spacecraft will still be getting singnal from Earth, because wonder if the eletronic gadgets over heat and just give out because the planet is so hot.

Lastly, they say that venus is our twin planet. I don't see how it can be our twin planet because it so hot and it's very radiant. The planet Venus has a rocky sediment and icludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Earth and Venus can be twins because Earth is not rocky it's a liquid based planet. Venus has a thin atmosphere because the heat keeps it's so hot and thin it can't get a break to even expand. But Earthis not as close, so Earth's atmosphere is a little bit thicker the Venus's atmosphere. Venus might also have some harmful chemicals. I say this because how do we know what's on the planet its could be all types of harmful gases from the sun. We never know what's there on Venus or what could happen if we go.

In conclusion,

I think Venus not is a worthy pursuit because of the dangers. Venus is too hot for human to live on it's too close to the sun. The atmosphere of Venus it too thin it lets too much heat into the planet. We wont be able to survive. How do you now we will have enogh oxygen on venus to live. We don't know how long it will take to get there and how much supplies we will need to take and what supplies to even take. It's al ot to think about before we could eventhink about living on Venus. We would need to figure a lot of things off first before we go. ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument.

1fdb506,"Everyone has at less had one car in there life time no matter how yes it was or how old or ragidy it was it was a car that was poluting our air and giving off greenhouse gas. Now I would now what i whould do with out my car but then again there are some berifits or advantages you would have if you didnt own a car.

We  can start off on now much money you would save if you did have a car. Think about gas is about what $2.99 now right? Or lets just say your driving minding your own bessnious and some edeit rams in the back of your new Nisson 2015 car and oh lord i dont think you want to talk about how high you insurents would go up. People in Vaudan and in most of France don't even have cars 70 percent to be exact. Now its not like a law that they can't have veicals just alot of people choose not to have one. How ever if you do own a car you will have pertty much no where to put it. Street parking,driveways and home garages are actally forbidden in some areas. If you still really really want your car you have only two places to put it. One in a large parking garage at the edge of the development or two you can buy a space for $40,000 along with a home. If you never had a car you wouldn't have to spend all that money on gas,insurents,getting your car repaired/fixed,and a parking spot. That's why 57 percent of people sold there car when they moved to Vauba.

The biggest advantage you would have if you didnt own a car is that you will be giving back to mother earth. Cars are responsible for 12 perect of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Cars can also be more stress then there worth having. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. What do you think scards you the most when your dive? Getting in a car crash and seriousaly injuring yourself or worse die on inpacked right? Why don't you save the stress and the fear. Just give up you car. I know what your think what if i work far away etc? Just take the bus or better yet ride a bike to where ever you need to go or walk get some exercise and brake a little sweat. Or just take one day that we all not us own cars to just see how life would be. That's how BOGOTA got started in Colombia. They have been going it for 3 straight years. There are 7 million cizins people walked,hiked,and even skated. The only vehicals that where permitted where buses and taxis and if it rained it didn't stop them participating. Why can't we do that just for one day? If everyone just took one day that using cars I think i would make a big change.

There are many advantages we all would have if we all didn't have a car but I know it will take time for all of us to make that disitoin but hopful its soom before its to late for us and for the world.

20b7318,"During my life i have watched meny presidental elections on my telivision. To me the Electoral College on papper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphes on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not haveing the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not haveing a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presedency but won the populure vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. Anouther piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be presedent then how do we have a presedent that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College chould be a distaster waiting to happen is that rthe votes are tied which may seem not likey at forstn glance but say if the votes are tied the presedency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the desision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barly have a say on who gets to be presedent or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certine party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its posssable for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikey supports what im trying the say in my earlyer Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikey it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that ""we"" vote for the eclectoral College help vote for the presedent insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winner-take-all system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 1/4 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in papper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be.                    ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and consistent point of view on the Electoral College.

2103089,"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" talks about the positive and negative aspects of the driverless cars. I am totally against the development of these cars. They are not safe, they are not necessary, and anything can go wrong. I do not like thinking that the production of these cars can lead to harm or bad things in the future.

I am against the development of the driverless cars because they are not safe enough to be on real rodes. If there are children in the car and something happens to the car it could hurt the kids and be very dangerous. Also not having control of the wheel at all times is dangerous because even now when people don't have their hands on the wheel there are multiple risks like crashing. Another thing that is not safe about these cars is that if it goes out of control on the road many lifes could be in danger and no one would know if it was the driver or the car.

Another reason I am againt the driverless car is that they aren't necessary. Cars now are simple. People know how to press on the gas and turn the stearing wheel the way they want to go. It isn't necessary to make a brand new car that can drive on its own if people know how to drive with their hands and feet perfectly fine. A lot of people in the world drive. If they don't like driving they catch busses or taxis. Even with the driverless car the car still needs a driver. And if most people drive there is no point in making a driverless car that you still have to drive. There is no point in paying a lot of money for a driverless car when you stil have to drive it. Also why take chances on a car that you still have to drive when you have a car that you know how to drive? You would pay all that money just to still end up driving.

A third reason I'm going against the development of the driverless car is that something can go wrong. There are so many things that could go wrong with the driverless car and no one should take that chance. If a sensor messes up and doesn't detect a wreck coming up instead of notifying the driver it could keep driving and crash into the other vehicals. There are so many different issues involving construction, wrecks, and traffic on the road and if one thing goes wrong with the car it could mess up everything and something very dangerous could happen. If it doesn't sense that their is construction ahead and it keeps going something bad could happen and people could end up paying a lot of money.

Having a driverless car isn't worth the risk. There are many reasons the driverless car doesn't need to be on the roads. They are not safe, they aren't neccessary, and anything can go wrong at anytime. They shouldn't put the driverless cars on the road because if anything goes wrong everyone around could be in danger. The companies need to make sure that A sensor will never mess up and that everything is 100% perfect with the car before they put it out for anyone to use it.

very few people want their emotions to be documented on a computer where someone can read them off of. in order for a computer to understand emotions, the emotions and facial expressions for a specific emotion need to be documented. that would make it easy for a hacker to hack into your computer and figure out what emotions you express to certain things. on paragraph 6 the article says,"" imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a simular ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different."" not only will hackers figure out what emoitions you express to certain things, they can also figure out what you like/dislike or what emotions you express when texting someone.

22e1e7a,"Who would want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't you feel bored waiting for your turn to drive. If by chance, you got in an accident, who would you blame? The driver which will be you or the manufacture? I were in your shoes, I would rather drive around myself. I would rather drvier around myself, because I trust myself more than their driverless car. I believe any company should not try to developed driverless car.

First of all, I believe that any company should not try to developed a driverless car because it cause more accident. I believe it will cause more accident because the driverless car they develope is not 100 percent safe. Imagine a 50 cars driving it self in high way. You don't know who they are going to break or stop working. Even tho ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object"" I still would not trust it. Will you be ready when it's vibrate?

Second of all, I believe that any company should not try to developed a driverless car because it can lead to serious trouble. For example, If you get in an accident, who will you blame while driving driverless car? Will you blame yourself or the company. I can tell you this. No one won't want to lose their money. You won't want to lose your money nor the manufacturer. When this happen, someone will fill lawsuit. The company and the people will hate each other.

Another reason I believe that any company should not try to developed a driverless car because anyone won't like a driverless car who need assit. What is the different between you driving the car and you have to be ready when ever the car need assit. I can tell you that many people hate to wait. Also you can trust 100 percent that when the car need your assit. You don't know for sure that it will alert you. It is man mad car. Anything can happen. If I were you I will not trust them because they can lead you to death.

Finally, I believe that any company should not try to developed a driverless car because you can drive as you please. Pretend you are late for something. And you need to get there fast. You need to go faster and driverless car has certain speed. This are the reason I believe manufacturing should not develope a carless car. ",4,2.0,,":**

23ac622,"Cars. Cars were first made using human hands for humans to drive around in. Cars are a major evolution from walking around everywhere. In old days I don't know how hard driving was and/or if they had driver's licences.I think we as people should not except driverless cars.

Now a day's people have to take two test too be able to drive. First test is the reluctant permmit test once you pass that you have to get your hours. By hours I mean driving hours at night, morning, on the highway's, streets and etc. The second test we have to take Is the critical drivers test this test is mostly on you,you make your own pressure. There are two people in the car you and the (scorer),she/he dosn't matter who it is they will not jugde on race or sexuality.Once you pass that test your off to the races.

We as people have to go through all that as humans to be able to drive. I get those test make sure we will be responsible on the road so we don't injure yet even kill innocent bystanding pedestrians. All those test to keep them ok and safe I can deal with that so I will be able to drive. In some cases people don't even have a(n) permmit they just drive. There's a catch to that they don't drive stupid or and don't get pulled over.That's breaking the law but if the police don't catch them so be it.

Brains. I know people have those what about robots or A.I. do they have brains? Technically speaking they do have brains called the mother board. That Board/ chip is the harness to their thinking without that they are smart as rocks. What and how many test did they have to take too be able to drive for google, or BMW? I get people have been fasinating over cars that drive themselves. But if the A.I cant pull into drive ways or deal with complicated traffic issues like, roadwork or accidents. I get companies have did remarkable test with great outcomes.

Why do we want cars that drive themselves? The test that G.M did was a graet test and idea. Too exspensive they said how much money did futurist spend to make theese driverless cars.

in conclusion I don't think we need driverless cars. It will take alot more money to build than regular cars. So I say nay. To the future for now keep doing good things like finding a cure for cancer doing great there in that area. every baody probably couldn't afford the cars any way so that's less money.Thank you.",4,2.0,,":**

38eba82,"People are wanting to create ""Driveless Cars"". Driveless Cars are a car that you could drive without steering it or doing anything with driving like you do today, that is just making humans even more lazy. Humans are already lazy today but society wants to make us even more lazy by not doing things on our own now. Farmers already have tractors that are like this, the tell them when they need to turn around and that is it, other thant that the computer tractor does everything for you.

I think that Driveless Cars are pointless because we already have all this technolgy that we don't need but yet soem poeple are big on technolgy but there is also somw technolgy that we don't need. Why do we need Driveless Cars when we could drive the car ourself, do other thigns by ourself, and not be lazy? See the Google Car is programed to do everything that we should know about driving but the Google Car does all of the thinking for us.

The cars that you have to plug in instead of putting gas in are somewhat a good idea because then you wouldn't have to pay fo rgas but on the other hand you have to charge your car up every night, replace the charger when it is out of charging the car, and you would worry abotu if your car would make it through the dya or not. So the charging your car in a good idea but there is also some cons about it too.

My personal thought is that we shoudl not have these Driveless Cars because it woudl make us humans think that we can do whatever we want adn just be lazy all the time when in reality we can do everything on our ow, we just choose not to. There are some good ideas with it, like the BMW has vibrating seats if the seat is dozing off and it keeps the driver alert. The Google car is watchign teh driver for the most part, when the car shoudl be watching the road to, notjust the driver.

So me personally, I think that we shoudl not get Driveless Cars. They will make humans thingk they can do anything they want to, make us lazy, and make us not do our own work. People that work are the hard workers because they make the effort to do things.    ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument against the development of driverless cars.

43bbaee,"The author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. Sergey Brin envisions a future with a pulbic transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. Television and movies have been fascinated with cars that could drive by themselves. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions. I would be against the development of driverless cars because it would be expensive, would need more improve technology, and would need to make new laws for driverless cars.

Driverless cars can drive by themselves without a driver. It would fundamentally change the world. You can travel without handling the wheel at all.There are alot of technology that will help the car be driverless. In movies the criverless cars have been driven more than half a million miles without crashing. The founder of the Google Car project believes that the technology can make driverless taxi cabss to take them whereever they desire.

It would be to expensive to make the driverless cars come true. With the technology on the car, it would have cost a lot of money. The radar for the cars cost two hundred million dollars if theer are no sensors, no computers, and no mapping. There are sensors that helps control the car. The combination of all the sensors would be necessary fro the driverless car to mimic the skills of a human at the wheel. It would be expensive because of all the technology that the driverless cars needs for it to drive on its own.

It would need more improve technology to function the driverless car. Google's modifed Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor to mimic a human at the wheel. You could build smart-roads systems, but they will require massive upgrades to the existing roads. Automakers used speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of the antilock brakes. It would take that much technology to make the driverless car to work.

It would need new laws to keep the driver safe. The lawmakers would try to make laws that are safe for for drivers, passengers, and pedestrains safe. The lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alerted drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in conmtrol at all times. Most states say it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. If the traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liabiblity in case of an accident.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not safe to drive and risk the driver in danger.It takes lots of technology to control a driverless car.I do not agree with driverless cars because they are expensive, they would need more improve technology, and they would need to make more laws that would make the citizens safe. Some people said that it is possible to make driverless cars in hte future. I think that if we made driverless cars, we would not be sure that everyone will be safe.",4,2.0,,":** The essay presents a clear point of view against the development of driverless cars. However, the arguments are not well-developed and lack sufficient evidence to support the claims. The essay also fails to address the potential benefits of driverless cars.

44d5b69,"The face on mars was not made by aliens or anything else. The details from from the old camera made it look like a face because it was blurry. They told people about the face and showed to help make money for Nasa. it was made naturally from volcanoes and other things like sand storms. It would be impossible for aliens to do it from this distance and make it look that much like it from a bad camera.

The detail from the camera made it look that way because we didnt have the best technology back then than we do now. Also, each year we got better technology and it started to make it look less like a face each time. In the story before paragraph one it show pictures of each year they took a pic of it and it slowly became less of a face. Once we got better technology it made stuff much easier for us to see and tell if it was made or it was just a coincidence.

Next, nasa told everyone about there discover and that made a lot of new movies and magizines come out from it. they wanted money so in paragraph five they talk all about it and about how they wanted stuff to happen. People thought they were trying to hide somethings about aliens making the faces as proof. The people wanted know a lot about this and waited for the pictures to come up on a website and many was disappointed.

After, that face is made out of it sand and mostly rock from volcanos when they burst into flames and creates land forms. The wierd shadowing is comeing from all the sand around them and makes slight shadowing on the face to make it look like a face. it took many years for them to find something like this and then they realized it was just a landform. The only way for smoething like that to happen is by luck not aliens because aliens didnt do anything here or on mars. the sun was a big helper in making the face because nothing could cause that shadowing to happen on mars.

I know that some people beleive that aliens are real and some people don't beleive in aliens. I kind of get why people think that in the first place because what possibly can creat such huge thing that looks like an humans face. All you have to do is think about it because it is impossible for there to be aliens around us. We are to far away from other life to be found by aliens; there are trillions of trillions of stars with more planets by them. The possability of them finding us so fast is merely unbelievably impossible in my opinion. So aliens did not make the pyramids on earth and they did not make the face on mars .

Lastly, the face on mars did not get created by aliens; it was created by nature. The only reason we thought we saw a face is because of the old camera that couldn't see it without blurring stuff out. the main reason they told people about the face is just to make some money for nasa in the first place. The face is not made out of metal or some alien material because all it is made out of is rock and the red sand that is on that planet. That is why aliens didn't make it because they couldn't of because they aren't real.",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and coherent argument.

44f2536,"The author talks about how dangers Venus could be if humans get there and start of the exploration in Venus. Venus has a lot of carbon dioxide which that could be bad for humans to inhail. In paragraph 3 it says ''almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.'' This means that most of Venus's atomsphere is cover with a carbon diocide which could be bad for humans to inhail it.

Also the article talks about Venus having clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid and its very dangerous for human to make

contact with that dangerous matterial. In paragraph 3 it says ''Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.'' This means that its very dangerous for humans to go to Venus and tried to explor the whole planet.

The article also talks about the planet's surface. The planet's surface could reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and that would be able to kill a human very quickly. In paragraph 3 it says ''On the planet's surface tempertures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.'' Which this means that it could kill a human in a instant if a person went to Venus and tried to explor Venus.

The article also talks about the pressure of the planet's atmosphere. On paragraph 3 it says ''The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experence on our own planet.'' What this means it could kill a human in a instant if a person went to Venus and tried to study Venus.

The article also talks about what would happen if humans took a submarine and metals to Venus. In paragraph 3 it says ''Such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest part of our ocean and would liquefy many metals.'' This means that Venus has a lot pressure that can crush a submarine and also it has a very hot surface that can liguefy metals in instant.

The article also talks about the Venusian geology and weather in Venus's. In paragraph 3 it says ''Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.'' This means that it has the same kind of weather but its more aggresive and more dangerous then the ones we have on Earth.

47a5dff,"Cars can now drive themselves without a person. Cars should not be able to do that. They are ment for people to drive them and have control of them. Involving technology with cars is not safe. Technology can and will fail. More accidents are prone to happen. People are getting to rolled up in the technology world and are loosing skills that could be useful. Various employees will loose their job.

Technology is always failing in businesses. It is not trustwothry. Why put your life in hands of technology? People have expierienced how technology sometimes crashes, freezes, and even recieves viruses. With technology involved vehicles could easily be broken in to or messed with. People now are seeing that technology is taking over and are getting more smart at it. Smart enough to be able to hack and send viruses. Its fairly easy and possible to break in to cars now, but now imagine how easy it could be just controlling with a computer.

Also the number of accidents will go up. One can easily forget how to control technology or not know. With ""smart,"" cars if you forget you will not be able to stop the car which will cause a accident. Regular cars are controlled by people so one can easily and phyisically stop the car. Of coarse cars can always fail and with smart cars the car can stop but what if the technology crashes or fails. Honestly more technolgy is always crashing within people's daily life than breaks.

Also as paragrpah 4 states, the need of smarter roads will be needed for a car to be fully ""smart"". This whole smart car invloved with technology thing is very expensive. Money will be lost and to untrustworthy items. People should no let their life earnings go to waste on something that can basically be a path to death.

The technolgy already involved with cars is enough. The sensors that help people from hitting surrounding items with their car is really a big help.

As paragrpah 5 states some technology like sensors are nothing new. But improvement on sensors to where the vehicle does all the work and people just sit there does not sound right. This technolgy can help elderly and handicapped people but once again the would need to know how to use this new technolgy.

Getting a computer or any other technology device can take long or usually it is not possible. Getting a car fixed also takes time but, there is always a way that doesn not involve buying a new vehicle. Technolgy doesn't last much time before it gets damaged or a new version comes along. Cars are made to last long and again be able to get fixed up easily. WIth a smart cars, People will have to learn new things wit how to fix and work these cars. Which will take time since fixing a car and working a computer is a different thing.

In conlcusion, technology is taking the world over but technolgy is not worth the lives of people.

It fails and crashes which will make the number of accidents rise. People need to see that although there is problems alreday with regular cars people have more probelms

with computers and phone on a daily basis. ",4,2.0,,":** The essay lacks a clear and consistent point of view.

4993cfc,"Driverless cars should not be used on the road yet, or anytime soon. Driverless cars are way to damngerous, and could take up a lot of money. The main thing most people would be worried about is the fact there not really in control of what goes on with the vehicle they purchased. There could be many costly bills, many law suits, for something you didn't do, but what your driverless vehicle did. This could lead to too much then we neen when we could all do what the vehicle is made for, which is for us to drive not to drive by itself.

Even though many people have already started investing in the idea for driverless cars, they could be putting themselves in a bigger hole then they thought. The money there putting up could go to waste cause more then likely people would want to drive there own car. This meaning there investing in something that nobody would probleby not want. The big name companies such as Toyata, and Chevy could lose alot of money, when they was making more doing it the normal way. If your in the car driving what you bought you would feel better about your car.

The driverless cars could come with maufunctions that could lead to law suits. Things like your brakes, your steering wheel and even wheels could mess up and you're not there to see who did it or not, cause the car is driverless. Such as if someone was to his your car and the car was messed up, how would you know who did it. Little things like that could change someones whole perspective on the vehicle. Which could make the people take back the car and get a normal one, which means the big name companies would lose money.

Not only would we have to wait to even get the car, you would have to be careful with the laws too. Laws such as keeping people focused on the road. Such as if someone hit the car your not driving who would be respansible. If no one was there in either of the cars no one would win the law suit. Many states its already illegal such as California, Nevada, Florida, and Columbia. Once other states realize the damages, they'll change there minds too, and make new laws for cars, Which will make them fustrated and ban cars from many places. In that case if that happens the big name companies will lose a lot of customers and long time assumers, then eventually lose all there money they invested.

This could lead to too much then we neen when we could all do what the vehicle is made for, which is for us to drive not to drive itself. The driverless vehicle is not safe enough to be on streets yet. Nobody would know who's responsible for the mistake of a (driverless car) nondriver. There will be lots of laws banning them and running car buissness down the drain. There would be many things wrong with the routes, such as if there was a car acctident, and the car had to reroute it couldn't.

49e0d87,"Why is the world upgrading so fast? Living in a world that is upgrading by the day is like watching your son or daughter grow up from day one. Most people around the world want to upgrade one thing at a time and other people want to upgrade a hundred things everyday. What is the point of having driverless smarter cars? There isn't one. There are so many teens around the world that just can't wait until the day they get that special with there picture on it. Their licence. Yes, teens can be dangerous on the road;but still. I bet, when your was a tennager, you couldn't wait for that special day. Now, what teenager wants to grow up to not getting a licence and just being driven around by a driverless car? Nobody does.

We all know that guys who have nice lifted trucks or jeeps, they like to have fun with them. With driverless smarter cars you can't do none of that. What if something inside the car broke all the sudden and you couldn't do anything about it because it is a driverless car? ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture?""(parragraph 9). Now, when there is a wreck on a highway or backroad, the world doesn't freak out about it. If the world started to buy driverless smarter cars and something like that happened because of the car malfunctining, the one who was injured will probably sew and world would stop buying them becuase they are scared it will happen to them. That wouldn't be good for that certain buissness.

The world shouldn't be upgrading as fast as it is now. Before, the world was upgrading but not as fast. The world should have kept it that way. At the rate we're going, by 2020, factories won't even make steering wheels anymore; because the world doesn't need them. ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi,and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020""(parragraph 10). If anything, cruise control is enough. I mean, nobody wants to drive a thousand miles while pushing on a gas pedal. Who can trust a driverless car and sleep while it drives you a thousand miles away? Not a whole lot. ""Telsa has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time'(parragraph 10).

Driverless cars are pointless. Who wants to be killed because of a car that drives itself when you could've just driven yourself and avoided what happened? Not me. In conclusion, if people around the world feel that they have a driverless car, then go for it. ",4,2.0,,": The essay lacks a clear and coherent point of view.

4a7605d,"Do you think that the the human face looking thing in Cydonia, on Mars, was created by aliens? I do not. I think that it is nothing but a Martian mesa. There is no factual evidence for aliens making this ""monument"", it is familier to us on Earth, and it would not make any sense for it to be hidden from us.

First of all, there are no facts to support that aliens created this landform. For example, the theory was based on no evidence or facts. No facts even hint to the landform being created by aliens exept that it kind of resembles a face. And there are plenty of chips, and even grilled cheeses that looks like a person, or even Jesus.

Like having no factual evidence, the landform seen in Cydonia on Mars is somewhat similar to things that us humans on the Earth can see. The landform on Mars is similar to landforms that we have on the Earth today. On our planet, there are many mesas, just like the one found on Mars. And we know that the mesas on our planet are created by natrual events or occurences.

Last of all, it would make absolutly no sense for NASA to be hiding that the landform was created by aliens, wich it wasn't. If it were alien made, NASA would tell us, in order to make money. For example, if NASA figured out that it was created by aliens, they would want to tell us in order to make money to expand the Mars exploration program. But, hiding it, they make less money, because people want to know more about othe life-forms, not a lifeless, rusted planet. (but wateer was recently discovered on Mars)

In conclusion, the landform on Mars was not created by aliens, but meerly just a natrual landform. This theory has no factual evidence, can be seen on Earth, and does not make any sense. And, though, there will always be people who will always believe that it was created by aliens, you should now believe other-wise.

46b1195,"You get upearly on November 6, 2012 ready to vote, because every vote counts! But does it really? Instead  of your vote going directly towards who you want as president, it goes towards the electoral collge and then they decide who really wins the presidency. The Electoral College ia a system where instead of the people vote for the president, a group of electors choose the next leader of the free world. I fervently believe that we should abolish the Eletoral College sytem, and change the election of popular ovte because it is an injustice, outdated, and irrational.

The Electoral College system is highly unfair. The voters wnat to elect the president that they would like, and in order to do that their vote should be significant. Although  the Electoral Collge system is at times efficent, it still does not satisify the voters. The people aren't even the ones who get an actual say on who their next president will be. Even the people who are in defense of the Electoral College System agree, ""It is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" (15), says Richard A. Posner author of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing president."" In the 2000 elections, candidate Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, and won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral college vote so he lost the presidency. If this is supposedly a ""free"" country with a democratic system, then shouldn't the citizens have the right to pick the individual that will be running their country for the next four years?

Some electors may not even vote with the majority. Voters can't control who their electors vote for. The electors are even sometimes picked by the presidential candidate running for office, how does it seem fair that a group of people that hold the fate of our country in their hands is chosen by soemone who would be highly affected by their decision.

It is also an injustce because of the way the votes count. If you live in a state with a higher population, your state gets more electoral votes. The amount of electors depends on the amount of senators and representatives your state has. There is one elector per representative, and two per senator. There is a total of 538 electors, and to win presidency the candidate mst have at least 270 or higher. For example sya you live in Iowa, where there are only four electors, the vote doesn't count as much as the votes in California or Florida.  The system is completely outdated too. The Electoral College system has been around for hundreds of yars,a dn it is not up to date with our modern times, so it is a complete waste to use it.                        ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that the Electoral College system should be abolished.

46df9c0,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a a butte/mesa landform on Mars, that has started a huge controversy between skeptics and Nasa, because it depicts a human face. At first we were skeptical about the validity of this landmark, and we were not sure about what it really was. Some of our other scientists got on the case and according to paragraph 12 of the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" article, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West. People were not going to easily accept this easily.

According to paragraph 5 in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" article,

""It has starred in a Holywood film,. appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--evne haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"". This transformed

and fueled people to start being skeptical about wheather or not it was a sign of life or not. They started to deny that me and other scientists at NASA were telling the truth and even thought that we would rather hide it then tell anyone. I can prove that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform on Mars because, we have taken high quality pictures on a clear day of the landform, we would share with the world if their was life on Mars, and we have studied it enough to see it is just a rock, thats shadows that make it appear as a face.

The first piece of evidence of this Face just being a landform is that we have taken the highest quality pictures possible, and we even did it on a clear day. The pictures were way more high quality then the original pictures, and accoriding to passage 10 ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This showed clear as day what the ""Face on Mars"" really looked like. We then even took more pictures on a clear day because people started to speculate and according to passage 8 ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Us scientists decided we had to take it on a clear day, so we did and now we can tell you that is 100% what the landmark looks like.

The second piece of evidence for the Face only being a natural landform is that if we knew their was life on Mars we would tell the people. We would make a lot of money and we would be able to keep NASA going and get enough money to keep funding us. According to passage 5 ""Some people think that the ""Face on Mars"" is a bona fide evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This just proves my point of we would tell the people, and we would let everyone know because their is no reason for us to hide this from the people, and we would make a lot of money and would be able to keep funding NASA.

The last piece of evidence about the ""Face on Mars"" just being a natural landform is that we have observed the landform for long enough, and according to paragraph 12""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" This proves my point of us being able to identify just from the picture that it is a butte or a mesa, and it is easy for us to know, because we already have some all across the American West. We also know according to paragraph 3 that ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This shows that we have observed this landform for long enough and taken enough pictures that we can identify that it is just a landform that has shadows that just make it portray a human face.

In conclusion me and other scientists at NASA know what we are doing, and would like to inform everyone that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform. We would tell the people about this as quick as possible if it really wasn't, and we would not try to hide it from the public at all. I hope all skeptics understand that we have enough evidence to believe that this is not a human face, that is just a landform, that we have taken enough pictures to understand what it is, and that there is nothing to worry about.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view that the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform.

Smart planning is revoultionary buliding towns to not be dependent on driving. 70% of Vauban's famlies do not own car and are much happier to not have the everyday anxiteys of driving a motor engine car everyday. 57% sold there car just to move into the small town of Vauban. Car free suburbs and town are a growing trend all across Europe, the united states and many more nations. These efforts have been making cities, towns, and suburbs denser so you don't have to go far to get some milk and eggs.

The global warning is a huge part of the fight to make the earth our home more better and healthier for generations and generations to come. Cars emit gas emissions that make up 12% of the greenhouse gases in our enviroment, up to 50% percent in car-intensive areas in the United States and around the world.

France, Paris having heavy smog decided to have a partial ban on driving making even numbered license plates not drive or fear a fine. Congestion went down after the experiment. What was to blame for the smog was the Diesel fuel being used in most cars because of the fact that a tax policy favors diesel fuel over gasoline. Paris having more smog than the typical capital had a decrease in congestion and the citiy after enormous victory decided to go at it again and do odd numbered license cars.

The car culture is one the has had enormous effect on the everyday lives citizens around the world. In the United states, ""Recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" In America where the car culture has turned us into the number one place in the world to find the history of one of the planets world changing innventions. People want a greener earth and benifits of not owning a car because everybody knows the stress of having a car no matter ho much it helps you. The car in which you have to have insurance, life insurance, car payments, you have to keep up with your car, the dangers associated with having a car and stress plus anxiety that comes with a car. The cons outweight the pros but those pros have an enormous effect. People are changing and the percentile of teenagers and young adults have droped ten fold in getting or renewing a license. The new trend is that people are no longer getting cars or licenses so why should you.

The people of planet earth understand the pros or cons of a car the benifits of not diving and are making for that change. One of the worlds greatest innventions is stepping off there throne. So why will you not get a car?    ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of car ownership and provides adequate examples and evidence to support its position.

4720230,"Over many years, technology has become more and more advanced. Some of this technology has become so far that it can now detect human facial expression and determine what emotion they are expressing. This technology is called Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology, and it enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology can have a positive impact in school classrooms today. FACS can help improve the way students learn in schools, they way teachers teach their students, and most simportantly, help teachers detect when a student is feeling confused.

One of the main positive impacts FACS can have in reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is improve the way students learn. FACS can scan the facial expressions of the students in the classroom and determined if the majority of the students are confused by the leasson the teacher is teaching. FACS could then modify the lesson in a way that students can understand it and the teacher can then further clarify the lesson the way FACS shows it. As stated in pargraph six, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrctor"", this shows how FACS can help teachers in the way they teach. This could also explain to teachers how to clarify even more the lesson to students that may be going through hard times.

Another way FACS can have a great impact in schools all around the country is by improving the way teachers teach their classrooms. FACS can detect many expressions on students in a classroom. It can detect whether a student is perplexed by lesson or simply just bored. FACS can detect which students in the classroom are bored by analazing their facial expressions. As stated in pargraph six, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". FACS can then provide the teacher many ways in which they can make the lesson more interesting so that students can comprehand it better and in a more fun way.

The last way in which FACS can greatly improve the teaching environment in schools is by recognizing when a student is depressed or sad. FACS can detect facial expressions on students faces and determine if they may be going through trouble or are depressed. As stated on pargraph six, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". FACS could recognize when a student is not okay so that teachers can the help those students who may need help, wether that is emotional help or help with school work. FACS could even help save lifes by getting help to students who may be contemplaiting suicide.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can be extremely valuable to schools all around the world. This computer system can help teachers improve the way they teach their classrooms by analazing students' emotional expressions towards a certain lesson. It can help teachers by modifying their lessons in sich a way so that students are not bored or confused by it. Lastly, it can help teachers know which students may be going through hard times and help those who need help.

489e52a,"Wow! What a surpise, a new breakthrough of technology. This technology is known as the Facial Action Coing System. This system identifies human emotions. In this essay I will tell you why I think that this system is valuable. There are three main reasons why it is in such of value to us. One, it can help bring the truth out in people. Two, it can people get help if they always come to class with a sadness emotion on their face. Third, is that it can help with lessons being taught.

First, which is bringing the truth out of people. Now, I think this is valuable, not just to the classroom, but in the real world. This valuable in the classroom because it can identify whether a student is lying or telling the truth to his or her teacher at the time. This is essential because it goes along with my reason of that this technology helps with the lesson. This can help interpret if the student or students, are lying if you say if they know what is going on, and not confused.

Secondly, is that you will be able tell if a student or students are upset or not. I feel like this is important because it can be hard for the student(s) to concentrate on the lesson if they are too busy thinking about why they are upset. With the right attitude the teacher can help the student(s) get their education. Another reason why this is important because it can save lives of people that suffering from depression. This can help lower the amount of deaths in a year because it can help recognize that a student may need some psychological help. For example, in the passage it says,""...the software can identify mixed emotions.""This is important because it can tell what you are feeling inside. The teacher can maybe help the people cheer up and get on with the day's lesson.

Third, is that it can help with the lesson. Now this is very essential because it can help determine if the students are confused or bored. This is important because some students may be afraid to be one of the only ones to be confused of the subject. This is something o be recognized because it o decide to continue with the lesson or to move on to a different one of interest. As said in the passage,""A classroom computer could recognize when a studetn is bored or confused.""Also said,""Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""These quotes help get my point across because it shows that it can help recognize if the student is in a place of boredom or dispair.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in classrooms because it can help makes the teacher's job easier. Which can also help the students by, it recognizing if somone is being truthful , to help notice if a student may be upset for some odd reason, and that it can help the teacher know if the lesson that they previously just did needs some more work, or if he or she can move forward on to a different lesson.

48b152e,"Dear Florida Senator,

I am here to tell you about the electoral collage, and not why we should keep the horrible thing, but how we can replace it with something better. The electoral collage has been in use for a very long time, since the Constitution was finalized, but it should end now. The Electoral Collage is a confusing system that can easily be manipulated and changed to benifit one political party. As shown in many past elections, it has just become another reason people do not want to vote. Popular vote is easy and simple and it should be used in future elections.

First of all confusion is a huge factor when talking about  the Electoral collage. We as voters do not want all these processes. We do not want hoops that we want to jump through. We are simple people who want a simple process. In the electoral collage,  there are 538 electors, with a majority of 270 needed to be voted in as president. Each state gets entitled to two for your senators, and one for each member of the House of Representatives. This so far is making my head spin. This could be so much simpler if we just used the poular voting system. In this system, the people can directly vote for thier president without any huge hassel. This makes it easier and more fair for the voters. Speaking of fair, lets talk about how Unfair the Electoral Collage is.

In the Electoral Collage, there is no partial winning. It is a winner take all system, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. This makes it very unfair to votes. Swing states add on to this idea. Swing states are very large states that have a higher representation in the Electoral collage. These are also the main targets of presidential cannidates. By getting these swing states, cannidates can gain a lot of votes in one state. This leaves other states, such as Ohio and Montana with little to no interaction from the presidential cannidates. This is not fair. We need the popular vote system. We need to be able to equally represent everyone without any shady practices. And that is the last topic, the electors really control the final outcome.

The final sin of the electoral collage is just too big to look over. The electoral collage can change wether a person is voted in or not because of the electors. They choose who they represtent. If you can not see where this is going let me explain. A set of people who want a specific president can just represent him. This could go so far as to leave a state with only representatives of one cannidate. This could never happen in popular vote because we don't have electors, we have people. We have real American people who want to vote for who they want to vote for. Nothing more, nothing less.

Even though the Electoral Collage seems like th root of all evil, there are a few upsides. First, there is less likely to have a dispute than a popular vote. A dispute is not impossible, it is just less likely. Second, big states are weighted how they should be. They are larger states that comprise most of the population and the country. They should be represented more than smaller states. Finally, since it is a winner takes all, there are no Run-Off elections. This keeps the process shorter, but not as short as it would be in the popular vote system.

So to conclude, popular vote should be used in upcomming elections. The electoral collage is a confusing system that can easily be manipulated to help or hurt a specific cannidate. Although the electoral collage properly represent smaller states and avoids Run-Off elections, it does not represent smaller states and can easly shift the election from one side to another. Popular vote keeps the process short and makes it fair. It represents everyone fairly. I do not want you to agree with me, I want you to look and the cold hard facts. Popular vote should be used in the Election from now on.

48b771c,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" The author stated both positive and negative stances on the topic of driverless cars. This topic is very controversial when bringing in the aspect of safety and the well-being of others around the driverless car. And, because of that I believe driverless cars are not a good idea to bring into society.

First, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because drivers could get reckless at the wheel. In the text it stated that ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" meaning that at some point the driver would have to help the car navigate at times when the car couldn't(7). Which imposes that the drivers would have to be aware of his/her surroundings at all time when the time was needed for them to take the wheel again. But, doesn't that defeat the purpose of the car being driverless. No one would want a driverless car that still needs to be driven? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive""(8). And the most important question is, what would drivers do to pass the time when they're not driving. They could distract theirselves with their phones, music or any passengers which could cause them to miss out on any important message from the car telling them to drive or take over in the needed situation. This is where the reckless aspect of the driverless car comes in. Missing the important message could cause accidents and harm to other drivers or pedestrians. And, this cause of harm to others around leads to my next argument against driverless cars and that is lawsuits.

Second, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of who would be to blame if accidents did happen. In the text it explained how new laws would have to be created to go along with the cars when they are proved to be ""more reliably safe""(9). But what would happen ""If the technology fails and someone is injured""(9). This issue could cause many lawsuits filed against innocent ""drivers"" and many lawsuits filed against companies who were not aware of the issue with the cars technology. Sometimes things happen and because technology can not be trusted 100% of the time these cars should not be able to exist. Lives could be on the line and many people who were not to blame will take the blame for this mishap. The car could just cause a million more problems instead of solving the laziness of humans will not to want to drive.

Lastly, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of its proness to being hacked. Anything in the world could be hacked. Anyones phone can be hacked, computers can be hacked and even intelligence units can be hacked. So, if these things can be hacked then what makes one think that this driverless car can't be hacked. And, if hacked there would be no telling what the hacker could do to the car. For example, cause it to crash or lead the car into an area the driver in unfamiliar with because they're not paying attention. These examples could all cause harm to more than just the driver and that shows why this car should not be implemented into society, because it has various accounts on how it can misfunction.

These examples of recklessness, misblaming and hacking all show why the idea of having driverless cars are not a good idea. They can mess up society and cause harm in more ways than it could help society. Although the car is a very unique way of showing advancement in the technological world, one would have tot look at both sides before concluding whether or not this is a good idea, and in this case it seems that the bad outweighs the good.

49f24e5,"The idea of a driverless car has always been the goal set for future technology. This is seen in the constant stream of futuristic movies or shows. However, those only convey the positive and idealistic aspects of such vehicles. The ignorance of the negative information associated with them causes a personal disbelief in the cars. Driverless cars should not be developed due to the overwhelming evidence including that development/testing is against the law in the majority of the world due to the idea of possible malfunctions or irresponsible road behavior from the passengers.

A vast majority of people agree that testing should not occur due to possible danger. The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" speaks about how traffic laws are currently written to include human control of the vehicle in Paragraph 9. Furthermore, it talks about how limited the allowance of testing is. With a large scale rejection of such ideas it is wise to consider the fact that there is not just assumptions made by everyone. The article blatantly puts down the states who did not follow suit in allowing the tests. There was not any consideration of the majority possibly deciding this based on solid fact and the issues not yet addressed by the companies manufacturing the vehicles. So, the legality of the driverless cars is merely one point amongst a plethora of other issues.

One contribution to the rejection of testing is the possible malfunctions that could happen. All throughout the article the accidents in the future were expected. which is why the companies wish for the human assistance to be alert to ""take over"". However, when observing that statement closely the accident would be caused by the car itself due to the fact that it drove in such way. The weather could be an out of control factor involved and if the car does not drive in a way that considers that, then the fault is on the car. The same can be said for a car collision. If all of the vehicles in the world are driven by themselves, then it would be the cars that caused the collision. Paragraph 7 touches on the liability issues of situations similar to those mentioned. The issues surrounding the driverless cars are preventable by not producing them at all. That way there is no room for error when it comes to the safety of those on the road.

The manufacturers of the vehicle contradict themselves when it comes to the passengers involved. Paragraph 8 discusses making the driving fun by entertaining them. Whereas Paragraph 7 is about the driver taking over and the different functions to make them aware. The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Plus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place. Eliminate the possibilty of that irresponsible lack of attention by having the person drive to begin with.

Driverless cars would allow too many flaws in the system and legality issues that prevent them for obtaining the title of a safter option. The manufacturers are attempting to make a car that is easier and requires less effort, but in doing so there is a plethora of issues that accompany it. The question of who is legally to blame for issues would waste time and money. During the process of development, the producers are accepting accidents as a given fact instead of trying to produce a flawless car. They are also focusing on the idea of a ""entertaining car"" instead of one that keeps the passengers alert for possible accidents. Therefore, there are too many arguments for safety against the vehicles to even consider mass producing them. The driverless cars are much safer on the big screen than in reality.",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view against the development of driverless cars.

4a3a4a4,"I have an opinion that I know others will agree with extremely. By popular vote, we should change the election process to The People voting directly. According to my knowledge, the Electoral College isn't fair to voters. I know that many people such as, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFC-CIO agree with me on this. For instance, in the second passage on the first paragraph, it says that and much more. ""They're not alone [Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter...]; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Suggesting by what this satement says, a lot of people disagree with our system of election. We should be able to vote directly ourselves and not have electors do it for us. How do we know we can trust them? Yes, they're a part of our government, but that doesn't mean a thing.

The Electoral College was originally founded to be exactly what it is today; a vote that is held in Congress that is made by popular vote by citizens. But it has changed more than you think.  In article one in the 6th paragraph, it tells exactly how the Electoral College is run. ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This paragraph is saying that the person you vote for is basically supposed to be voted for by his electors. In the second  article, what the author is saying is that even though this certain person will get popular vote, they won't agree with it and they'll go against the votors decisions. This isn't the right thing, obviously. I'm sure that no one knows for a fact that's true though. Even though, this is still a messed up way to vote. This country is about freedom and the right to do what we'd like, as long as it's rational. This is not rational. We need to be able to vote independentley.

There are many things wrong with this aspect of our government. Even though people don't think much of it, we're being treated unfairly. In the second article, in paragraph 2, Plumer (the author) makes a very good point. ""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This makes us realize that we don't know who, for a fact, the electors are. It also shows that we don't know who the electors will vote for. Usually, they would probably vote for the person that were made to vote for.

None of us know what goes on in the Electoral College. We don't know if they vote for who we tell them to vote for. We don't know if they practically cheat us from getting the president we want. In article one, paragraph 8, there is something that the governor does that maybe is supposed to reassure us. ""After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Cerificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.""  This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it's also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want. As I have said through this whole letter, we deserve to directly vote for our President. This isn't fair to us or the person we want elected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",5,3.0,,":** The essay develops a clear point of view on the issue of the Electoral College and provides some evidence to support its position.

4b8a067,"Are you someone who is really good at hiding your feelings or emotions? or are you someone who is expressing everything that you feel inside and emotions?. More importantly, are you someone who likes to express your feelings but is not good at expressing it?. I am someone who is really good at hiding my feelings and someone who is not good at expressing feelings. I smile when I am sad and I cry when I am happy. The technology won't be able read my emotion when I can't even express myself. Therefore, the use of technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable because it cannot read your mind, it cannot see or feel your feelings and it will cost a lot of money.

First of all, I don't expect the computer to read my mind because it's imposible. It may read your outside

such as your appearance, body, or your outside emotions but it can't read what you are thinking inside.The article said, ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". I disagree with the quote above because you never know if she is pretending to be happy, surprised, sad or joyful. When you think about it, the only person that knows how you feel and how you think is you, the technology cannot define it. Let's say you are laughing in your mind and you don't show it outside, will the computer see your emotions?. Therefore, the use of this techology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable or inffective.

Furthermore, this technology cannot see or feel what you are feeling inside. The article said, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". The quote is basically saying this technology can see your emotions but I don't agree with it. Some students could be hiding their emotions or feelings. for example, one student is hurt and deeply sad inside but is pretending to be fine and smiling, will it know what she is feeling inside?. It will only see the fake emotions, the outer appearance and that is why the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable.

In addition, this technology is considered a high technology so it will cost a lot of money to own it. Some schools might not have enough money to purchase it. If this technology could do those things, most of all the schools might want it and if they can't purchase it, it is sad for them. Plus, this technology is not useful so why spend a lot of money on it. There are a lot of ways the schools could use the money such as donating so why spend money on technology that is not useful. It is not worth spending the money for, that is why the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable.

In conlusion, the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable because it cannot read your mind, it cannot see or feel what you are feeling inside, and because it costs a lot of money. It may see what you show but it cannot see what you actually feels inside unless you express it. If you are someone who is not good at expressing your emotions or feelings, this technology is not for you and is not valuable.

4c822ee,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" I do not think the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit very well. He also supports it a little and instead focuses on the dangers of the planet. Some of the dangers he says is that no spacecraft has even lasted a few hours on Venus, and that tempratures are around 800 degrees. The planet has to harsh of an atmosphere for us to visit.

The author almost seems like he should be supporting not going to Venus. In the third paragraph he talks about how deadly of an enviroment it is. He says that the atmosphere is made of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and that the clouds are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. These things alone would make it nearly impossible for any type of life to exist, so why explore a place where its imposible for anything to have ever lived there. With 97 percent carbon dioxide it could have been a possibility for plant life, but he then adds that on the surface it is over 800 degrees Fahenheit. With that kind of heat its impossible to survive.

To make things worse the author is not just talking about an unmaned spacecraft visit, he is talking about humans visiting it. With the atmospheric pressure around 90 times greater than Earth, we would die before we even reached the surface. Even if you were to get to the surface the there are still many obsticals to overcome. Life for example volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and lightning strikes.

One of the only times the author supports his idea is in paragraph 4. The author says ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" While that may sound interesting that is a huge probably. They are basing this off the fact that Venus has some of the same features of Earth like valleys and mountains. That is to big of a risk to take because it could cost millions of dollars and even a life if we sent a human there.

In paragraph 5 the author talks about ideas that could be used to send humans there like a blimp. To me that just sounds to risky because you can do all the testing you want but it only takes one small mistake for everything to go south. The value of Venus that he talks about is insight gained and because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The values he talks about here are simply not enough. The risks by far outweights the rewards.

That was why to me the author did not support his idea well enouth. To me he gave more dangers that he did rewards. Plus risking a human life is not to be taken lightly, you need to be 100% certain that they will survive. With tempratures above 800 degrees and an atmospheric preassure 90 times greater than Earth I don't see how anyone could survive. Even when a drone does not survive how is a human supposed to? That is why the author did not support the idea well enough. ",5,3.0,,": The essay develops a point of view that studying Venus is not a worthy pursuit, but it does so inconsistently.

4ceefe6,"Does anyone remeber when Google came up with the smart glasses that can do anything? It was said to be the next revolutionary smart item and everyone will either want it, or have it. Well, as it turns out, not even half of America bought these state-of-the-art glasses. Just as the Google glasses did not succeed, I believe the same thing will happen to driveless cars. Not only will they be extremely expensive to manufacture and buy, but they are also completely unecessary. There are already smart phones that can read fingerprints and buy anything just with a press of a button--correction: the press of a screen. Also, the cars can even possibly be labeled as unsafe. Anyone could go anywhere because there is no specific driver; nobody is in control. Children could drive off to anywhere they pleased if they felt like doing so. Also, as stated in the passage, who will pay for damages and possible hospital bills if there are accidents? It couldn't be the driver's fault, because they weren't even controlling the car. It couldn't be the manufacturers fault, because the car worked perfectly for testing, right? Driveless cars may be fascinating, but they are not a good idea for an improved way of driving.

First of all, these vehicles will be extremely expensive. The United States is already trillions of dollars in debt due to many wars and payments, and yet we still keep spending billions of dollars that we do not have. Not only will the cars cost a lot of money to make, but having to remake every single road so that these smart cars can drive on them will cost even more. The amount of construction workers that would have to be paid would shoot numbers through the roof! Exactly how much would these cars even cost? Guaranteed, the cost of buying these cars will not be equivalent to the average Toyota Camry or Honda Civic. The car may use half the fuel needed for regular cars, but they will cost a lot more than gas.

Secondly, these cars are not necessary. They are new! They are exciting! They are the most ridiculous idea to have been considered. So many machines do the work for people and this can result in a fat America. The United States has already been depicted as the most unhealthy country. If these cars can drive themselves, anyone could go anywhere without a driver. If this is correct, then it is possible for a child to possibly drive to the next state if they felt like it. Criminals wouldn't need a getwaway driver if all they had to do is hop in the car and press a button. This is an unsafe possibility. Although the driverless car may seem fun for people who want a new way to be transported, it is completely unecessary and lazy.

Finally, the idea of driverless cars may contradict with the law. As stated in the article, there may be some conflict between manufacturers and consumers when it comes to accidents and road problems. If there was an accident between two smart cars, who would pay for the damage? It is difficult to point fingers when both cars are driverless and are not controlled by a person. Will the manufacturers have a warranty for the car? Will each driver have to pay for damages themselves as if they just broke a cell phone? Does a separate insurance come with the car? These are questions that need to be answered if manufactureres want their ideas to sell.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea because they cost money that is not there, they are unecessary and may even be dubbed as unsafe, and the idea contradicts with many laws in different states. Just as the Google glasses was a bit too much, the driverless cars would meet the same unfortunate fate.",5,3.0,,":**

    * ""Does anyone remeber when Google came up with the smart glasses that can do anything?"" (should be ""Does anyone remember when Google came up with the smart glasses that can do anything?"")
    * ""Not only will they be extremely expensive to manufacture and buy, but they are also completely unecessary."" (should be ""Not only will they be extremely expensive to manufacture and buy, but they are also completely unnecessary."")
    * ""Also, the cars can even possibly be labeled as unsafe."" (should be ""Also, the cars could even possibly be labeled as unsafe."")
* The essay could be improved by carefully proofreading for errors in grammar and mechanics.

**Overall Feedback:**

The essay is well-written and makes a clear argument against the idea of driverless cars. However, the essay could be improved by providing more specific examples and evidence to support its claims, by using more precise language, and by carefully proofreading for errors in grammar and mechanics.",2.0
